2020-02-26,05:39,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much. Before I begin, I’d like to extend my deepest condolences to the victims and families in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Earlier today, a wicked murderer opened fire at a Molson-Coors Brewing Company plant, taking the lives of five people. A number of people were wounded, some badly wounded. Our hearts break for them and their loved ones. We send our condolences, we’ll be with them and it’s a terrible thing. Terrible thing. So our hearts go out to the people of Wisconsin and to the families. Thank you very much. I’ve just received another briefing from a great group of talented people on the virus that is going around to various parts of the world. We have, through some very good early decisions, decisions that were actually ridiculed at the beginning, we closed up our borders to flights coming in from certain areas. Areas that were hit by the coronavirus and hit pretty hard, and we did it very early."
2020-02-26,06:59,Donald Trump,"A lot of people thought we shouldn’t have done it that early and we did, and it turned out to be a very good thing. And the number one priority, from our standpoint, is the health and safety of the American people, and that’s the way I viewed it when I made that decision. Because of all we’ve done, the risk to the American people remains very low. We had the greatest experts, really, in the world right here. The people that are called upon by other countries when things like this happen. We’re ready to adapt and we’re ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads. As most of you know, the level that we’ve had in our country is very low, and those people are getting better, or we think that in almost all cases the better they are getting."
2020-02-26,07:51,Donald Trump,"We have a total of 15. We took in some from Japan, you heard about that, because they’re American citizens and they’re in quarantine, and they’re getting better, too. But we felt we had an obligation to do that. It could have been as many as 42, and we found that it was just an obligation we felt that we had. We could have left them and that would have been very bad. Very bad, I think. American people, and they’re recovering. Of the 15 people, the original 15 as I call them, eight of them have returned to their homes to stay in their homes until fully recovered, one is in the hospital, and five have fully recovered, and one is, we think, in pretty good shape and is between hospital and going home. But we have a total of 15 people and they’re in a process of recovering with some already having fully recovered. We started out by looking at certain things that we’ve been working with the Hill very, very carefully, very strongly, and I think we have very good bipartisan spirit for money. We were asking for 2.5 Billion, and we think that’s a lot, but the Democrats and I guess Senator Schumer wants us to have much more than that. And normally in life, I’d say, “We’ll take it, we’ll take it.” If they want to give more, we’ll do more. We’re going to spend whatever’s appropriate. Hopefully, we’re not going to have to spend so much, because we really think we’ve done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum. And again, we’ve had tremendous success, tremendous success beyond what people would have thought. Now at the same time, you do have some outbreaks in some countries, Italy and various countries are having some difficulty."
2020-02-26,09:58,Donald Trump,"China you know about. Where it started. I spoke with President Xi, we had a great talk. He’s working very hard, I have to say. He’s working very, very hard, and if you can count on the reports coming out of China, that spread has gone down quite a bit. The infection seems to have gone down over the last two days, as opposed to getting larger, it’s actually gotten smaller and one instance where we think we can be somewhat reliable. It seems to have gotten quite a bit smaller. With respect to the money that’s being negotiated, they can do whatever they want. I mean, again, we’ll do the two and a half. We’re requesting two and a half. Some Republicans would like us to get four, and some Democrats would like us to get eight and a half and we’ll be satisfied whatever it is."
2020-02-26,10:52,Donald Trump,"We’re bringing in a specialist, a very highly regarded specialist tomorrow, who works actually at the State Department. Very, very tremendously talented in doing this. I want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it, that I spoke with Dr. Foushee on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people are amazed to hear it. The flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. And so far, if you look at what we have, with the 15 people and they’re recovering, one is pretty sick, but hopefully will recover. But the others are in great shape. But think of that 25,000 to 69,000. Over the last 10 years, we’ve lost 360,000, these are people that have died from the flu, from what we call the flu. “Hey, did you get your flu shot?” And that’s something. Now what we’ve done is, we’ve stopped non-US citizens from coming into America from China. That was done very early on."
2020-02-26,12:06,Donald Trump,"We’re screening people, and we have been, at a very high level, screening people coming into the country from infected areas. We have in quarantine, those infected and those at risk. We have a lot of great quarantine facilities. We’re rapidly developing a vaccine and they can speak to you, the professionals can speak to you about that. The vaccine is coming along well, and then speaking to the doctors, we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly, a vaccine for the future, and coordinate with the support of our partners. We have great relationships with all of the countries that we’re talking about, some fairly large number of countries. Some it’s one person. And many countries have no problem whatsoever, and we’ll see what happens. But we’re very, very ready for this, for anything. Whether it’s going to be a breakout of larger proportions, or whether or not we’re at that very low level, and we want to keep it that way."
2020-02-26,13:12,Donald Trump,"So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people, and we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck. Johns Hopkins, I guess, it is a highly respected, great place. They did a study, comprehensive, “The Countries Best and Worst Prepared for an Epidemic” and the United States, we’re rated number one. We’re rated number one for being prepared. This is a list of different countries. I don’t want to get in your way, especially since you do such a good job."
2020-02-26,13:55,Donald Trump,"This is a list of the different countries. United States is rated number one. Most prepared. United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Thailand, Sweden, Denmark, South Korea, Finland, this is a list of the best rated countries in the world by Johns Hopkins. We’re doing something else that’s important to me, because he’s been terrific in many ways, but he’s also very good on health care and we really followed him very closely. A lot of states do. When Mike was governor, Mike Pence, of Indiana, they’ve established great healthcare, they have a great system there. A system that a lot of the other states have really looked to and changed their systems, they wanted to base it on the Indiana system, it’s very good. He’s really very expert at the field, and what I’ve done is, I’m going to be announcing, exactly right now, that I’m going to be putting our Vice President, Mike Pence, in charge and Mike will be working with the professionals and doctors and everybody else that’s working. The team is brilliant. I spent a lot of time with the team over the last couple of weeks, but they’re totally brilliant and we’re doing really well, and Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike will report back to me. But he’s got a certain talent for this and I’m going to ask Mike Pence to say a few words please. Thank you. Mike?"
2020-02-26,15:27,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. President Trump has made clear from the first days of this administration, we have no higher priority than the safety, security, health and wellbeing of the American people. And from the first word of an outbreak of the coronavirus, the president took unprecedented steps to protect the American people from the spread of this disease. He recounted those briefly, but the establishment of travel restrictions, aggressive quarantine effort of Americans that are returning, the declaration of a public health emergency, and establishing the White House Corona Task Force are all reflective of the urgency that the President has brought to a whole of government approach. As a former governor, from the state where the first MERS case emerged in 2014, I know full well the importance of presidential leadership, the importance of administration leadership, and the vital role of partnerships of state and local governments and health authorities in responding to the potential threat of dangerous infectious diseases."
2020-02-26,16:43,Mike Pence,"I look forward, Mr. President, to serving in this role. I’m bringing together all the members of the Corona Task Force that you’ve established. HHS, CDC, DHS, the Departments of Transportation and State. This team has been, at your direction Mr. President, meeting every day since it was established. My role will be to continue to bring that team together, to bring to the President the best options for action to see to the safety and wellbeing and health of the American people. We’ll also be continuing to reach out to governors, state and local officials. In fact, in recent days, the White House met with over 40 state, county, and city health officials from over 30 States and territories to discuss how to respond to the potential threat of the coronavirus. We’ll be working with them in renewed ways to make sure they have the resources to be able to respond. And as the President said, we’ll be adding additional personnel here at the White House, to support our efforts on the President’s behalf."
2020-02-26,17:53,Mike Pence,"We’ll also be working with members of Congress to ensure that the resources are available for this whole of government response, and we’ll be working very closely with Secretary Azar and his team that had done an outstanding job communicating to the public, to ensure the American people have the best information on ways to protect themselves and their families, and also that the public has the most timely information on the potential threat to the American people. Mr. President, as we’ve been briefed, while the threat to the American public remains low of a spread of the coronavirus, you have directed this team to take all steps necessary to continue to ensure the health and wellbeing of the American people, and the people of this country can be confident that under your leadership, we will continue to bring the full resources of the federal government in coordination with our state and local partners, to see to the health and wellbeing and to the effective response to the coronavirus here in the United States of America. With that, the president has asked me to recognize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, and also the Deputy Director of CDC, Dr. Anne Shocket for remarks. Secretary."
2020-02-26,19:18,Alex Azar,"Well, thank you Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Mr. President for gathering your public health experts here today and for your strong leadership in keeping America safe, and I just want to say I could not be more delighted that you’ve asked the Vice President, my old friend and colleague, to lead this whole of government approach with us under the emergency support function number eight. As of today, we have 15 cases of COVID-19 that have been detected in the United States, with only one new case detected in the last two weeks. We also have three cases among Americans repatriated from Wuhan, and 42 cases among Americans repatriated who had been stuck on the Diamond Princess in Japan. The President’s early and decisive actions, including travel restrictions, have succeeded in buying us incredibly valuable time. This has helped us contain the spread of the virus, handle the cases that we have, and prepare for the possibility that we will need to mitigate broader spread of infections within the United States."
2020-02-26,20:22,Alex Azar,"The President’s actions taken with the strong support of his scientific advisors have proven to be appropriate, wise, and well calibrated to the situation. We’re grateful for the hard work that healthcare workers, first responders, communities, and state and local leaders have put into the response so far. Because of this hard work, and the President’s leadership, the immediate risk to the American public has been and continues be low. Our containment strategy has been working. At the same time, what every one of our experts and leaders have been saying for more than a month now remains true. The degree of risk has the potential to change quickly, and we can expect to see more-"
2020-02-26,21:03,Alex Azar,"It has the potential to change quickly, and we can expect to see more cases in the United States. That is why we’ve been reminding the American public, and our state, local, and private sector partners that they should be aware of what a broader response would look like. CDC has recommended that the American public, and especially state and local governments, businesses and other organizations should refresh themselves on how they would respond in the event that the situation worsens. We’re encouraging Americans to learn what future steps might be necessary to keep themselves and their communities safe. Knowing these potential steps now can help keep the risk for you in your community low."
2020-02-26,21:40,Alex Azar,"Americans can find useful information at cdc.gov/covid C-O-V-I-D19, and we’re working closely with government, and private sector partners to educate them about preparedness. Finally, we’ve begun working with Congress to secure the funding that we need. There are five major priorities in the White House request to Congress that the White House made on Monday. These priorities are first, expanding our surveillance network, second, support for state and local governments work, third and fourth, development of therapeutics and vaccines, and fifth, manufacturing and purchase a personal protective equipment like gowns and masks."
2020-02-26,22:24,Alex Azar,"As chairman of the president’s coronavirus task force, I’m committed to providing regular updates from our coordinated inter agency process. We’ve had our top public health leaders like those joining me here today speaking to the media many times per day to inform the American public. The Trump administration is going to continue to be aggressively transparent, keeping the American people, and the media apprised of the situation, and what everyone can do."
2020-02-26,22:50,Alex Azar,"With that, I’m going to hand things over to Dr. Ann Schuchat. Dr. Schuchat is the senior career official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the principal deputy director with an over 30 year career at the CDC in public health, and as a member of the United States Public Health Service Commission Corps. Dr. Schuchat I’ll turn over to you."
2020-02-26,23:12,Dr. Schuchat,"Thanks so much Mr. secretary. As you know, this has been a difficult, and challenging time, and our hearts go out to the individuals who have been directly affected by the virus, and to all those who’ve been working tirelessly in responding to it. Our aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working, and is responsible for the low levels of cases that we have so far. However, we do expect more cases and this is a good time to prepare. As you heard, it’s the perfect time for businesses, healthcare systems, universities and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off, and make sure that they’re ready, and we have lots more information at the CDC’s website and in partnership on how to do that."
2020-02-26,24:07,Dr. Schuchat,"But, it’s also a really good time for the American public to prepare, and for you to know what this means for you. The coronavirus that we’re talking about is a respiratory virus. It’s spread in a similar way to the common cold, or to influenza. It’s spread through coughs and sneezes, and so, those everyday sensible measures that we tell people to do every year with the flu are important here; covering your cough, staying home when you’re sick, and washing your hands. Tried and true, not very exciting measures, but really important ways that you can prevent the spread of respiratory viruses."
2020-02-26,24:52,Dr. Schuchat,"The trajectory of what we’re looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain, but many of the steps that we have taken over the past 15 years to prepare for pandemic influenza, and our experience going through the 2009 H1N1 pandemic of influenza remind us of the kinds of steps that our healthcare system, our businesses, our communities and schools may need to take. We’re in this together, all of government, the public, and the private sector, and the CDC wants to make sure you have the best information available every day. Thank you."
2020-02-26,25:35,Donald Trump,[inaudible 00:25:35] please.
2020-02-26,25:38,Dr. Anthony Fauci,I just want to give you a very quick update on the…
2020-02-26,25:41,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:04:41].
2020-02-26,25:43,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"My name is Dr. Tony Fauci. I’m the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH. Just a very quick update on the counter measure development in the form of vaccines and therapeutics, I had told this audience at a recent press briefing that we have a number of vaccine candidates and one prototype, one to give you a feel for the timeframe of the vaccine, and what its impact might be now and in subsequent years is that I told you we would have a vaccine that we would be putting into trials to see if it’s safe, and if it induces a response that you would predict would be protective in about three months."
2020-02-26,26:21,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I think it’s going to be a little bit less than that. It’s probably going to be closer to two months. That would then take about three months to determine if it’s safe, and immunogenic, which gives us six months. Then you graduate from a trial, which is phase one of 45 people to a trial that involves hundreds, if not low, thousands of people to determine efficacy. At the earliest an efficacy trial would take an additional six to eight months. Although this is the fastest we have ever gone from a sequence of a virus to a trial, it still would not be any applicable to the epidemic unless we really wait about a year to a year and a half."
2020-02-26,27:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Now, that means two things. One, the answer to containing is public health measures. We can’t rely on a vaccine over the next several months to a year. However, if this virus, which we have every reason to believe it is quite conceivable that it will happen will go beyond just a season and come back and recycle next year. If that’s the case, we hope to have a vaccine, and then, finally and briefly, therapeutics. There are a number of antiviral drugs that are being tested. A few days ago we initiated a randomized controlled trial of a drug called Remdesivir, which has antiviral activity in vitro in an animal model."
2020-02-26,27:47,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The good news about that is that it’s a trial that’s randomized to either placebo or standard of care, and drug and standard of care, which means that we will know reasonably soon whether it works and if it does, we will then have an effective therapy to distribute. Thank you."
2020-02-26,28:04,Donald Trump,"Okay, thank you [inaudible 00:07:05]."
2020-02-26,28:05,Unnamed,"Thank you very much Mr. President. First of all you have just come from a long and busy trip from India, and-"
2020-02-26,28:14,Donald Trump,"Great country, a long journey [crosstalk 00:28:17]."
2020-02-26,28:20,Unnamed,"… concern you have a great [inaudible 00:28:20] and medical team behind you, and with you, and I’m sure [inaudible 00:28:25] India Mr. President, where do we go from here? U.S. India [inaudible 00:28:34] are concerend [inaudible 00:28:36]. Mr. President you are ready [inaudible 00:28:38] in India, and [inaudible 00:28:40] in America. What is the future? Indian American community is with you Mr. President."
2020-02-26,28:46,Donald Trump,"We won’t talk too much about that other than I just got back, a long flight. It’s a long flight. He’s a great gentleman, a great leader. It’s an incredible country. We were treated very, very well, and we really enjoyed it. A lot of tremendous progress was made in terms of relationship. Our relationship with India is extraordinary right now, and we’re going to be doing a lot of business with India. They’re sending billions and billions of dollars now to the United States, but we’d rather talk about this right now."
2020-02-26,29:17,Unnamed,"Mr. President, CDC said yesterday that they believe it’s inevitable that the virus will spread in the United States, and it’s not a question of if, but when. Do you agree with that assessment?"
2020-02-26,29:27,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t think it’s inevitable. It possibly will. It could be at a very small level or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens, we’re totally prepared. We have the best people in the world. You see that from the study we have the best prepared people, the best people in the world. Congress is willing to give us much more than we’re even asking for. That’s nice for a change, but we are totally ready, willing and able. It’s a term that we use, it’s ready, willing, and able. It’s going to be very well under control. Now. It may get bigger, it may get a little bigger. It may not get bigger at all. We’ll see what happens, but regardless of what happens, we’re totally prepared, please."
2020-02-26,30:08,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:09:08].
2020-02-26,30:08,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you talked a little earlier about the screening measures that you’ve put in place, and the travel restrictions you’ve put in place from China. At this point as the virus spreads in Italy, South Korea. Are you planning on adding those countries [crosstalk 00:30:19]."
2020-02-26,30:19,Donald Trump,"Well, just to understand, I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the president of other countries. Other countries on the list that are very respected in what they do in terms of what we’re talking about, but I really want to be responsible for this country. If it means placing a very strong situation on the border so people can’t come into our country from a country that is infected, we’re doing that and we’ve already done it with numerous countries, but we have to focus on this country. I don’t think it’s right to impose ourselves on others."
2020-02-26,30:51,Donald Trump,"But, if others aren’t taking care, or we think they’re doing it incorrectly, we’re dealing with world health, and we have terrific people, and CDC does go around, and help other countries, give them recommendations as what to do, but they’re working on their countries, and we’re working on our countries, and so far from our simple end it’s really worked out very well."
2020-02-26,31:12,Unnamed,… just visit Africa?
2020-02-26,31:12,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:31:12] can you clarify, are you considering restricting travel to and from South Korea, Italy, and other countries that have been affected [crosstalk 00:31:21]?"
2020-02-26,31:22,Donald Trump,"At a right time we may do that. Right now it’s not the right time, but at the right time, and we are checking people as they come through specifically for the problem that we’re dealing with. We’re checking a lot of people, if they’re coming from South Korea, it’s been hit pretty hard. Italy’s been hit pretty hard. China is obvious what’s happened in China, but again, the numbers seem to be leveling often going down in China, which is very good news, so we’ll see what happens."
2020-02-26,31:44,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:31:44] Mr. President.
2020-02-26,31:44,Unnamed,"White House is seen today denying that they are going to a point of the czar to run point on the coronavirus response today. The secretary Azar testified that he didn’t think one was necessary, and they were going to run it out of HHS, and you yourself have been downplaying this, so why are you now selecting the vice president to [crosstalk 00:31:59]."
2020-02-26,31:59,Donald Trump,"Well, Mike is not… Azar is vice president. He’s in the administration, but I’m having everybody report to Mike. Mike’s been very good, very adept. Anybody that knows anything about health care, they look at the Indiana model, and it’s been a very great success. It’s been a tremendous model in terms of healthcare, and this is really an offshoot of that, so this isn’t Azar. I don’t view Mike as a Azar. Mike is part of the administration, but I’m having them report to Mike. Mike will report to me. They’ll also be reporting in some cases to both."
2020-02-26,32:28,Donald Trump,"I’ll be going to meetings quite a bit depending on what they want to do, and what message we want to get out, but we’ve done really an extraordinary job. When you’re looking at a country this size with so many people pouring in with the number one in the world for people coming into a country by far, and we have a total of 15 cases, many of which almost much within a day, I will tell you most of whom were fully recovered. I think that’s really a pretty impressive mark. Now, we did take in 40 people that were Americans, and they’re also recovering, but we brought them in, so I have a different group, but we felt we had an obligation to American citizens outside of the country that were trying to get back in. We thought it was very important."
2020-02-26,33:11,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:33:11] Mr. President.
2020-02-26,33:13,Unnamed,"The stock market has taken a big hit over the past few days. What can you do about that, and if the CDC is right in saying that the spread is inevitable, are you going to be dealing with stock market issues and economy issues for some time to come?"
2020-02-26,33:24,Donald Trump,"Well, I really think the stock market, if something I know a lot about, I think it took a hit maybe for two reasons. I think they look at the people that you watch debating last night, and they say if there’s even a possibility that can happen. I think it really takes a hit because of that, and it certainly took a hit because of this, and I understand that also because of supply chains and various other things, and people coming in, but I think the stock market will recover. The economy is very strong, the consumer is the strongest it’s ever been."
2020-02-26,33:52,Donald Trump,"Our consumers are incredible, they’re incredible, that’s why we’re doing well and even before the virus, we’re doing great. Other countries have not been doing great. Our consumer’s very, very strong, very powerful economically. Yeah. Please."
2020-02-26,34:05,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:34:06].
2020-02-26,34:05,Unnamed,"Mr. President, have you been presented any plans that would involve quarantine cities like we saw in China and what would have to happen for you to take a step on that?"
2020-02-26,34:13,Donald Trump,"We do have plans of on much larger scale should we need that. We’re working with states, we’re working with virtually every state, and we do have plans on a larger scale if we need it. We don’t think we’re going to need it, but you always have to be prepared, and again, Congress is talking to us about funding and we’re getting far more than what we asked for, and I guess the best thing to do is take it, we’ll take it."
2020-02-26,34:37,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:34:37].
2020-02-26,34:37,Unnamed,Mr. President how much money are you willing to give Congress if they’re going six billion more than you can offer?
2020-02-26,34:43,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going see if we’ll take care of states because states are working very hard. We have hospitals in the states that make rooms available, and they are building quarantined areas. Areas where you can keep people safely. We’re working really well with states. It’s a very big part of it. My attitude if Congress wants to give us the money so easy, it wasn’t very easy for the wall, but we got that one done. If they want to give us the money, we’ll take the money. We’ll just do a good job with it. Yeah, please. Go ahead."
2020-02-26,35:10,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:14:09].
2020-02-26,35:10,Unnamed,"Mr. President, should Americans be going out getting protective equipment such as masks, and so forth? And if so, what is the U.S. Doing to boost production of masks?"
2020-02-26,35:19,Donald Trump,"Well, we can get a lot of it. In fact, we’ve ordered a lot of it just in case we need it. We may not need it. You understand that, but in case we’re looking at worst case scenario, we’re going to be set very quickly, but I don’t think we’re going to ever be anywhere near that. I really don’t believe that we’re going to be anywhere near that. Our borders are very controlled. Our flights in from certain areas that we’re talking about are very controlled. I don’t think we’ll ever be anywhere near that. Please go ahead."
2020-02-26,35:44,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:35:44].
2020-02-26,35:45,Unnamed,"Back to the stock market for a second, that travel related stocks have especially been hammered here in the last couple of days. What would you say to Americans out there who right now are looking forward to the summer or the upcoming months and saying to themselves, “Should I make myself summer plans? Should I go travel abroad?”"
2020-02-26,36:00,Donald Trump,"Well, hopefully they’re going to be able to do that. We hope that it’s going to be in good shape by that time, but they’re going to have to remain a little bit flexible. Yeah, I would say travel related companies certainly right now they would be hurt. At the same time this ends, this is going to end. Hopefully, it’ll be sooner rather than later, and I think the business that they lost will be picked up at a later date, but right now I think they’re probably not going to be going to China. They’re not going to be going to certain countries where the problem is far greater than it is in the United States."
2020-02-26,36:37,Donald Trump,"What it’s going to do is keep people home, and they’re going to travel to places that we have. It’s the greatest tourism country in the world, so instead of leaving our country, leaving our shores, they’ll stay here, and again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done."

2020-02-26,37:04,Unnamed,"What is your response to speaker Pelosi who said earlier today you don’t know what you’re talking about, about the coronavirus? I’m also wondering if you’d want to address critics who say you can’t be trusted with what your administration is saying."
2020-02-26,37:12,Donald Trump,"Sure, I think speaker Pelosi’s incompetent. She lost the Congress once, I think she’s going to lose it again. She lifted my poll numbers up 10 points. I never thought that I would see that so quickly, and so easily. I’m leading everybody. We’re doing great. I don’t want to do it that way. It’s almost unfair if you think about it, but I think she’s incompetent, and I think she’s not thinking about the country, and instead of making a statement like that where I’ve been beating her routinely at everything, instead of making a statement like that, she should be saying, “We have to work together because we have a big problem potentially.”"
2020-02-26,37:47,Donald Trump,"And, maybe it’s going to be a very little problem. I hope that it’s going to be a very little problem, but we have to work together instead, she wants to do that. Same thing with Chuck Schumer. He goes out and he says, “The president only asked for two and a half billion dollars. He should have eight and a half …” This is the first time I’ve ever been told that we should take more. Usually, it’s we have to take less, and we should be working together. He shouldn’t be making statements like that, because it’s so bad for the country, and Nancy Pelosi, she should go back to her district, and clean it up because it’s the number one… If you look at percentage down, that was one of the finest in the world, and now you look at what’s happening."
2020-02-26,38:23,Donald Trump,"I’m just saying we should all be working together. She’s trying to create a panic, and there’s no reason to panic, because we have done so good. These professionals behind me, and over here, and over there, and back here, and in some conference rooms. I just left a group of 45 people that are the most talented people in the world. Parts of the world are asking us in a very nice way, can they partake, and help them, so Nancy Pelosi shouldn’t… And, she knows it’s not true. All they’re trying to do is get a political advantage. This isn’t about political advantage. We’re all trying to do the right thing. They shouldn’t be saying, “This is terrible. President Trump isn’t asking for enough money.”"
2020-02-26,39:04,Donald Trump,"How stupid a thing to say. If they want to give us more money, that’s okay. We’ll take more money. Some Republicans think we should have more money too. That’s okay. We’ll take more money, but they shouldn’t demean the people that are on the stage who are the finest in the world. They’re not demeaning me. They’re demeaning the greatest healthcare professionals in the world and people that do exactly what we’re talking about."

2020-02-26,39:38,Donald Trump,"Well, when they get their opinion totally wrong as the New York Times did, and frankly, they’ve got a lot wrong over the last number of years, so let That work its way through the courts. If you read it you’ll see it’s beyond an opinion. That’s not an opinion, but something much more than an opinion. They did a bad thing, and there’ll be more coming"

2020-02-26,40:07,Donald Trump,"I hope so, because Shinzo, obvious, a very good friend of mine, I love the people of Japan, and I hope it’s going to be in good shape. As you know, you have a number of people in Japan who have been infected. I hear they’re doing a very professional job, which doesn’t surprise me at all with Shinzo and with all of the people you have. I know Japan very well. I think they’re going to handle it very well. It’s a little tight. They spent billions of dollars building one of the most beautiful venues I’ve ever seen, and your prime minister is very proud of it. I hope it’s going to be fine. We hope it will."
2020-02-26,40:41,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:40:42].
2020-02-26,40:41,Unnamed,"Thank you very Mr. President. The doctor at CDC just talked about dusting off preparedness plans, but coming from you it has more weight, do you feel like U.S. schools should be preparing for a coronavirus spreading?"
2020-02-26,40:58,Donald Trump,"I would think so, yes. I haven’t spoken specifically about that with the various doctors, but I would think so, yes. I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down not up, but yeah, I think school should be preparing, and get ready just in case. The words are just in case. We don’t think we’re going to be there, we don’t think we’re going to be anywhere close, and again, if you look at some countries, they are coming down, it’s starting to go in the other direction."
2020-02-26,41:29,Donald Trump,"This will end, this will end. You look at flu season, I said 26,000 people. I’d never heard of a number like that. 26,000 people going up to 69,000 people doctor you told me before. 69,000 people die every year, from 26 to 69, every year from the flu. Now, think of that. It’s incredible. So far the results of all of this that everybody’s reading about, and part of the thing is you, you want to keep it the way it is. You don’t want to see panic because there’s no reason to be panicked about, but…"
2020-02-26,42:03,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to see panic because there’s no reason to be panicked about. But when I mentioned the flu, actually, I asked the various doctors. I said, “Is this just like flu?” Because people die from the flu, and this is very unusual. And it is a little bit different, but in some ways, it’s easier. And in some ways, it’s a little bit tougher. But we have it so well under control. We really have done a very good job. Go ahead."
2020-02-26,42:24,Unnamed,"Thank you. Mr president. You mentioned the stock market earlier. To go back to that, to be clear, the Dow Jones dropped more than 2000 points this week. Are you suggesting that that was overblown? Are financial markets overreacting here?"
2020-02-26,42:38,Donald Trump,"I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves and they say, “If we ever have a president like this,” and there’s always a possibility, it’s an election, who knows what happens, right? I think we’re going to win. I think we are going to win by a lot. But when they look at the statements made by the people standing behind those podiums, I think that has a huge effect, yeah."
2020-02-26,43:03,Unnamed,You don’t think the selloff had to do with the Coronavirus?
2020-02-26,43:03,Donald Trump,"I think it did. I think it did, but I think you can add quite a bit of selloff to what they’re seeing because they’re seeing the potential. Again, I think we’re going to win. I feel very confident of it. We’ve done everything and much more than I said we were going to do. You look at what we’ve done, what we’ve done is incredible with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and rebuilding our military, taking care of our vets and getting them choice and accountability."
2020-02-26,43:27,Donald Trump,"All of the things we’ve done, protecting our second amendment. I mean they view that second amendment, they’re going to destroy the second amendment. When people look at that, they say, “This is not good.” So you add that in. I really believe that’s a factor. But no, this is what we’re talking about is the virus. That’s what we’re talking about. I do believe in terms of CNBC and in terms of Fox Business, I do believe that that’s a factor. Yeah. And I think after I win the election, I think the stock market’s going to boom like it’s never boomed before. Just like it did by the way after I won the last election. The stock market the day after went up like a rocket ship."
2020-02-26,44:17,Unnamed,At what point would you be considering loosening the travel restrictions regarding China.
2020-02-26,44:17,Donald Trump,"When we’re at a point where we don’t have a problem. We’re not going to loosen the travel restrictions, that’s what saved us. Mike alluded to it, had I not made a decision very early on not to take people from a certain area, we wouldn’t be talking this way. We’d be talking about many more people would have been infected. I took a lot of heat. Some people call me racist because I made a decision so early. And we had never done that as a country before, let alone early. So it was a bold decision. It turned out to be a good decision. But I was criticized by the Democrats. They called me a racist because I made that decision, if you can believe that one. We have to all work together. We can’t say bad things. And especially when we have the best team anywhere in the world and we really gave it an early start. We gave it a very early start."
2020-02-26,45:04,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:45:04] consistently called for enormous cuts, the CDC, the NIH and the WHO. You talked a lot today about how these professionals are excellent, hypercritical if necessary. Does this experience at all give you pause about those consistent cuts?"
2020-02-26,45:15,Donald Trump,"No, because we can get money and we can increase staff. We know all the people, we know all the good people. There’s a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years. If we ever need them, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money, and I’m a business person, I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly. For instance, we’re bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this great government that we have, and very specifically for this. We can build up very, very quickly and we’ve already done that. I mean we really have built up, we have a great staff and using Mike, I’m doing that because he’s in the administration and he’s very good at doing what he does and doing as it relates to this. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-02-26,46:06,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. President. So far your administration-
2020-02-26,46:09,Donald Trump,"I picked him, but your fine. Go ahead."
2020-02-26,46:11,Unnamed,Is only testing less than 500 people. And health officials are questioning whether that’s enough comparing to other countries who have tested more than tens of thousands of people. Are you planning to test more people?
2020-02-26,46:23,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re testing everybody that we need to test and we’re finding very little problem, very little problem. Now you treat this like a flu. In fact, I might ask one of the doctors to come up and explain it. You want to wash your hands a lot. If you’re not feeling well, if you feel you have a flu, stay inside, quarantine yourself, don’t go outside. But there are certain steps that you can take that we won’t even be necessary. In many cases when you catch this, it’s very light, you don’t even know there’s a problem. Sometimes they just get the sniffle. Sometimes they just get something where they’re not feeling quite right. And sometimes they feel really bad, but that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for and we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-02-26,47:14,Unnamed,"Two weeks ago Mr. President, your acting OMD director was in this room and was talking about what he expects to be GDP growth for this coming year. He said it was 3%, and we’ve talked about the effects of the Coronavirus on the supply chain, the declines in the financial markets. Are you still confident that you’ll see that kind of economic growth this year?"
2020-02-26,47:36,Donald Trump,"No. We’re going to have tremendously low unemployment. We’re setting records in that. In fact the administration is as you know, the lowest average unemployment of any administration in history. And our numbers are very low, very good, 3.5 3.6. But you can’t really see what this does in terms of GDP. It could affect it, but that’s irrelevant compared to what we’re talking about. We want to make sure it’s safe. Safety number one, but this would have an impact on GDP. But we’re still a very, very… We’re doing great, but this will… I’ll tell you what has a big impact. Boeing has a big impact. How did that happen? A year ago all of a sudden that happened. I think that took away a half a point to a point even. It’s a massive company, I think Boeing, we had the general motors strike. That was a big impact on GDP."
2020-02-26,48:25,Donald Trump,"And of course we’re paying interest rates. I disagree with the head of the fed. I’m not happy with what that is because he’s kept interest rates. President Obama didn’t have near the numbers and yet if you look at what happened, he was paying zero. We’re paying interest. Now, it’s more conservative and frankly people that put their money away and now getting a return on their money as opposed to not getting anything. But I think we’re the greatest of them all. We should be paying the lowest interest rates. And when Germany and other countries are paying negative rates, meaning they’re literally getting paid when they put out money. They borrow money and they get paid when it gets paid back. Whoever heard of this before? It’s said first. But we don’t do that. So I totally disagree with our fed."
2020-02-26,49:07,Donald Trump,"I think our fed has made a terrible mistake. And it would’ve made a big difference as good as we’ve done, even without the 2000 points, and we started off at 16,000 and we’ll be at 28,000 without. We were going to crack 30,000. We have had increases like nobody’s seen before, but we’re doing well, but we have to watch… We’re doing well anyway in other words, even despite the 2000 points, it sounds like a lot and it’s a lot, but it’s very little compared to what we’ve gone up. But we’ll be watching it very closely. But we have been hurt by general motors. We’ve been hurt by Boeing and we’ve been hurt, in my opinion, very badly by our own federal reserve, who has also created a very strong dollar. That’s something nice about a strong dollar, but it makes it much harder to do business outside of this country."
2020-02-26,49:57,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. A number of your supporters online have embraced these theories or forwarded these theories that the CDC may be exaggerating the threat of coronavirus to hurt you politically. Rush Limbaugh the other day said this has been advanced to weaponize the virus against you."
2020-02-26,50:12,Donald Trump,"You don’t mean my supporters, you mean my people that are not supporters."
2020-02-26,50:15,Unnamed,"Right, your opponents."
2020-02-26,50:16,Donald Trump,I agree with it.
2020-02-26,50:17,Unnamed,Have you seen evidence of that?
2020-02-26,50:19,Donald Trump,"And I’d like it to stop. I think people know that when Chuck Schumer gets upset… He did the same thing with a couple of trade deals that are phenomenal deals now. Everybody’s acknowledged they’re phenomenal deals before he ever saw the deal. He didn’t even know we were going to make a deal. They said, “What do you think of the deal with China?” “I don’t like it. I don’t like it.” He talked about tariffs. I left the tariffs on 25% on $250 billion. He said, “He took the tariffs off.” He didn’t even know the deal and he was out there knocking it because that’s a natural thing to say. But when you’re talking about especially something like this, we have to be on the same team. This is too important. We have to be on the same team."
2020-02-26,50:58,Unnamed,Have you seen evidence that the CDC is trying to hurt you?
2020-02-26,51:01,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t think the CDC is. No, they’ve been working really well together."
2020-02-26,51:08,Donald Trump,"They really are. They’re professional, I think they’re beyond that. They want this to go away. They want to do it with as little disruption and they don’t want to lose life. I see the way they’re working. These people behind me and others that are in the other room, they’re incredible people. No, I don’t see that at all."
2020-02-26,51:27,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. President.
2020-02-26,51:28,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, I appreciate it. I don’t know who said that, but I appreciate it."
2020-02-26,51:34,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President. Tonight you’re minimizing the risk of danger or the virus. Are you telling the Americans, except for the ones who are sick, not to change any of their behaviors?"
2020-02-26,51:44,Donald Trump,"No, I think you have to always… I do it a lot anyway, as you probably heard, wash your hands, stay clean. You don’t have to necessarily grab every handrail unless you have to. You do certain things that you do when you have the flu. View this the same as the flu. When somebody sneezes, I try and bail out as much as possible when they’re sneezing. I had a man come up to me a week ago. I hadn’t seen him in a long time and I said, “How are you doing?” He said, “Fine, fine.” He hugs me. I said, are you well? He says, “No.” He said, “I have the worst fever and the worst flu,” and he’s hugging and kissing me. So I said, “Excuse me.” I went and I started washing my hands. So you have to do that. I really think, doctor, you want to treat this like you treat the flu, right? And it’s going to be fine. It was so nice of you to say thank you very much."
2020-02-26,52:39,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. president.
2020-02-26,52:39,Donald Trump,Go ahead. Give me a nice question then. Don’t ruin it. Don’t ruin it with a bad question. Go ahead.
2020-02-26,52:44,Unnamed,"It’s really nice to talk to you without the helicopter. But also I want to talk to you about 2014. During the Ebola crisis, you said you wanted a “Full travel ban.” You said Obama was a quote unquote stubborn dope not for doing it. You said just stop the flights dummies. You also said it was a quote unquote total joke to appoint someone to lead the Ebola response with “Zero experience in the medical field.”"
2020-02-26,53:08,Donald Trump,They listened to a lot of what I had to say.
2020-02-26,53:10,Unnamed,I did. So how does that square with what you’re doing now.
2020-02-26,53:13,Donald Trump,"Well, because this is a much different problem than Ebola. Ebola, you disintegrated, especially at the beginning. They’ve made a lot of progress now on Ebola. But with Ebola we were talking about it before, you disintegrated. You got Ebola, that was it. This one is different, much different. This is a flu. This is like a flu and this is a much different situation than Ebola. And we’re working on a right now by the way, we’re working on certain areas of the Congo. The Congo has Ebola and caused largely by the fact that they have war and people can’t get there. We can now treat Ebola. At that time it was infectious and you couldn’t treat it. Nobody knew anything about it. Nobody had ever heard of anything like this, so a much different situation."
2020-02-26,53:54,Unnamed,"Mr. President, let me ask you this."
2020-02-26,54:01,Donald Trump,"Yeah, go ahead."
2020-02-26,54:02,Unnamed,"And just the course of the last couple of minutes, you have disputed some of what the officials that are working in your administration behind you have said about the risk of Coronavirus and its spread. Do you trust your health officials to give you good information or do you trust your instincts more?"
2020-02-26,54:15,Donald Trump,"They’ve said it could be worse, and I’ve said it could be worse too. [crosstalk 00:54:19] No, I don’t think it’s inevitable. I don’t think it’s inevitable. I think that we’re doing a really good job in terms of maintaining borders in terms of letting people in, in terms of checking people, and also, that’s one of the reasons I’m here today, getting the word out so people can… They’ll know. They’re going to know. No, I don’t think it’s inevitable. I think that there’s a chance that it could get worse. There’s a chance it could get fairly substantially worse, but nothing’s inevitable."
2020-02-26,54:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Brazil has its first case."
2020-02-26,54:52,Donald Trump,"That’s right, Brazil."
2020-02-26,54:54,Unnamed,"Right, Brazil. And you have many Americans now in Brazil for Carnival. What are your concerns and what are the procedures and practices that you plan to implement as those Americans are trying to come back home?"
2020-02-26,55:06,Donald Trump,"Yes, we’re very strong on people coming in from Brazil. Now it only has one case, it’s a big country, but it only has one case, but still it’s a case. We deal with Brazil very well. The president’s a very good friend of mine. In fact, he ran on exactly, it’s called “Make Brazil Great Again,” that’s what he ran on. We get along very well. I know you’re so thrilled to hear that. We get along very, very well. And we’re working with Brazil, but we have much worse instances than Brazil. You have Italy and you have other countries where they have much more than one person."
2020-02-26,55:33,Donald Trump,"They have one person right now, as of now, as of just a little while ago, one person in Brazil. But Italy is a deeper problem, and we’re checking people coming in very, very strongly from those. And at some point we may cut that off. At some point depending on what happens, we may cut certain additional countries off like we’ve had to do with China. And we hope we can open it up to China as soon as possible, and we hope the numbers that we’ve been getting are true on China where it really has leveled off and started to go down because eventually sometime that’s going to happen. Go ahead."
2020-02-26,56:07,Unnamed,"Thank you very much. You’ve said repeatedly that you think the federal government is very prepared, that you’re ready for this, but if you think that Secretary Azar is doing such a great job, why did you feel the need to make a change and put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the federal response to this virus?"
2020-02-26,56:25,Donald Trump,"I think Secretary Azar is doing a fantastic job, but he also has many other things. We’re working on many, many things together. If you look at his schedule of what he’s doing, including drug prices, I think it’s perhaps the most complicated job that we have in government, and I want him to be able to focus on that. And Mike is really good at it. They’re going to work together, they’re going to work very closely together, and they’re both in the administration. I see them all the time, so it really works. This isn’t Azar, this isn’t going out and getting somebody that’s never been in the administration. I have two people that are very talented and it’s something I feel good about. I don’t want to spare the horses. I have very talented people. I want to use them on this because I want it to stay low or as low as possible."
2020-02-26,57:11,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. I want to get to China. At the beginning of this outbreak, the Chinese communist party covered it up. That has been the general consensus of everyone. How can you now legitimately trust President Zi and the Chinese communist regime-"
2020-02-26,57:31,Donald Trump,President Xi.
2020-02-26,57:31,Unnamed,to be forth coming and forthright with this [inaudible 00:57:41]?
2020-02-26,57:41,Donald Trump,"Well, I can tell you this. I speak to him. I had a talk with him very recently and he is working so hard on this problem. He is working so hard, and they’re very tough and very smart. And it’s a significant group of very talented people that are working. And they’re calling up Dr Fowchee, they’re calling up our people. We’re dealing with them, we’re giving them certain advice. We actually have through World health, we have them over there also and we have a lot of our people making up that group that went over there. No, he’s working very hard. It’d be very easy for me to say… It doesn’t matter what I say, really. I can tell you he is working… I had a long talk with him the other night. He is working really, really hard. He wants it to go away from China and go away fast, and he wants to get back to business as usual."
2020-02-26,58:36,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:58:36] flu has a fatality ratio of about 0.1%.
2020-02-26,58:38,Donald Trump,Correct.
2020-02-26,58:40,Unnamed,This has a fatality ratio of somewhere between 2 and 3%.
2020-02-26,58:45,Donald Trump,We think. We don’t know exactly. And the flu is higher than that.
2020-02-26,58:50,Unnamed,"There’s more people who get the flu, but this is spreading or it’s going to spread maybe within communities."
2020-02-26,58:55,Donald Trump,It may.
2020-02-26,58:55,Unnamed,That’s expectation. Does that worry you? Because that seems to be what worries the American people.
2020-02-26,59:00,Donald Trump,"No because we’re ready for it. It is what it is. We’re ready for it. We’re really prepared. We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We’re very ready for it. We hope it doesn’t spread. There’s a chance that it won’t spread too, and there’s a chance that it will. Then it’s a question of at what level? So far, we’ve done a great job. When you have 15 people with this whole world coming into the United States, and the 15 people are either better or close to being better, that’s pretty good. All right, we’ll do one more. Go ahead."
2020-02-26,59:31,Unnamed,"Mr. President, there’ve been many cases of price gouging on the sales of medical equipment mast and so-on. Should the government be investigating that, looking into it? Do you have a message on that."
2020-02-26,59:42,Donald Trump,"If you tell me that’s happening, we would definitely investigate. We don’t want that. All right, one more. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yes."
2020-02-26,59:51,Unnamed,Are you working with China right now? Specifically in what areas?
2020-02-26,59:55,Donald Trump,"We’re working with China. We just did the biggest trade deal in history. We did two of them between a USMCA and the China deal. It’s the biggest in history. The relationship with China is a very good one, and I can tell you that again, President Xi is working really hard. He wants this problem solved, as hard as you can work. Thank you all. I may leave you behind and you can answer a few more questions. [crosstalk 01:00:19]"
2020-02-26,01:00:44,Alex Azar,"If I could just clarify, think you’re not getting the point here of this. I’m still chairman of the task force. Mick Mulvaney has been serving actually an invaluable role for me as acting chief of staff, helping to coordinate across the government with my colleagues and the whole government approach. Having the vice president gives me the biggest stick one could have in the government on this whole of government approach."
2020-02-26,01:01:04,Unnamed,"So, you don’t feel like you’re being replaced?"
2020-02-26,01:01:06,Alex Azar,"Not in the least. When this was mentioned to me, I said I was delighted that I get to have the vice president helping in this way. Delighted. Absolutely."
2020-02-26,01:01:16,Unnamed,Will you answer a few more questions?
2020-02-26,01:01:19,Alex Azar,Not tonight.
2020-02-29,00:00,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, everybody. Before we begin, I’d like to congratulate all of those incredible people that have worked for so long on our endless war in Afghanistan. 19 years going on 20 years and there hasn’t been a moment like this. We’ve had very successful negotiations, we think they’ll be successful in the end, the other side’s tired of war. Everybody’s tired of war that’s been a particularly long and gruesome one. I want to congratulate President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan. I want to remember all of the people, all of the great, great men and women that have lost their lives in the war and to their parents and wives and husbands and families, brothers and sisters. It’s a great, great people. Many lives over such a long period of time have been lost."
2020-02-29,01:25,Donald Trump,"I want to thank our wounded warriors, people that are still bearing pain and all of the problems that they’ve had to go through. They’re incredible people, incredible spirit. I’d go to Walter Reed and see them so often and the spirit they had, they wanted to go back despite their wounds. They always said, “I want to go back.” Wounded warriors, they’re incredible people. I guess most of all, I want to thank all of the people in the United States for having spent so much in terms of blood, in terms of treasure and treasury. The money that has been spent, the lives that have been lost, and we just signed an agreement that puts us in a position to get it done, bring us down to in the vicinity of 8,000 troops. The United Nations was informed of everything and NATO has been a great. Secretary Stoltenberg has been fantastic. I want to thank the United Nations for the help they gave and I also want to thank and congratulate Secretary Stoltenberg of NATO. 29 countries involved and all approving, all very happy with what’s going on. I want to also thank and congratulate Secretary of State Pompeo and Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper and I’ll be meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not too distant future. We’ll be very much hoping that they will be doing what they say they’re going to be doing. They will be killing terrorists. They will be killing some very bad people. They will keep that fight going."
2020-02-29,03:37,Donald Trump,"We’ve had tremendous success in Afghanistan and the killing of terrorists, but it’s time after all these years, to go and to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. And again, it’s been a long journey in Afghanistan in particular. It’s been a very long journey. It’s been a hard journey for everybody. We’re very largely a law enforcement group and that’s not what our soldiers are all about. They’re fighters. They’re the greatest fighters in the world."
2020-02-29,04:16,Donald Trump,"As you know, we’ve destroyed in Syria and Iraq, 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%. We have thousands of prisoners. We’ve killed ISIS fighters by the thousands and likewise in Afghanistan. But now it’s time for somebody else to do that work and that’ll be the Taliban and it could be surrounding countries. There are many countries that surround Afghanistan that can help. We’re 8,000 miles away, so we’ll be bringing it down to 8,000 to approximately 8,600 in that vicinity. And then we’ll make our final decision some point in the fairly near future, but this was a very spirited agreement. There was a lot of talk, there was a lot of everything. They’ve been trying to get this for many years and just it’s time."
2020-02-29,05:22,Donald Trump,"So I just want to thank everybody. I want to congratulate everybody. I really believe the Taliban wants to do something to show that we’re not all wasting time. If bad things happen, we’ll go back. I let the people know, we’ll go back and we’ll go back so fast and we’ll go back with a force like nobody’s ever seen and I don’t think that will be necessary. I hope it’s not necessary. So I just wanted to bring that up before we begin on a topic that has become very, very important to everybody. First of all, the amount of work that these professionals behind me and many other professionals in many rooms behind us who are watching right now, don’t have the room here to bring them all in, but they have been working round the clock so hard on the coronavirus. It’s a tough one, but a lot of progress has been made. I want to provide an update to our people, to our citizens, to the world, frankly on our action to address the coronavirus and those that have been hurt badly by it."
2020-02-29,06:49,Donald Trump,"At this moment, we have 22 patients in the United States currently that have coronavirus. Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s. Four others are very ill, thankfully 15 are either recovered fully or they’re well on their way to recovery. And in all cases they’ve been let go in their home. Additional cases in the United States are likely, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover and we think that will be a statement that we can make with great surety. Now that we’ve gotten familiar with this problem, they should be able to recover should they contract the virus. So healthy people, if you’re healthy, you will probably through a process and you’ll be fine."
2020-02-29,07:57,Donald Trump,"Since the early stages of the foreign outbreak, my administration is taking the most aggressive action in modern history to confront the spread of this disease. We moved very early. That was one of the decisions we made that really turned out to be a lifesaver in a sense, big lifesaver. On January 31st I imposed travel restrictions on foreign nations who had and anybody that had been to China or people coming out of China. I want to say that China seems to be making tremendous progress. Their numbers are way down and if you read Tim Cook of Apple said that they’re now in full operation again in China. The numbers are way down. Experts now agree that the decision to move so quickly despite a lot of opposition on that decision was a wise one, it greatly slowed the spread of the virus to the United States. It really gave us time to do some of the critical moves that we’ve done and it allowed these great professionals to get together and figure it all out. We think they’ve done that."
2020-02-29,09:19,Donald Trump,"We’ve taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus. They are the most aggressive taken by any country and we’re the number one travel destination anywhere in the world, yet we have far fewer cases of the disease then even countries with much less travel or a much smaller population. As an important part of our efforts, on Monday I’ll be meeting with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world actually. They’ll be coming to the White House and we’re talking about a vaccine and developing very quickly and they’ve already started working on it, developing very rapidly a vaccine for the virus, to combat the virus. And we’re having very good initial feedback, but these companies will be coming to the White House on Monday. Tremendous amounts of supplies are already on-hand. We have 43 million masks, which is far more than anyone would have assumed we could have had so quickly and a lot more coming."
2020-02-29,10:34,Donald Trump,"Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force led by Vice President Mike Pence, they met for two and a half hours. I spent a lot of that time with them also and we came up with some ideas, recommendations, and frankly some pretty strict edicts that we’re going to be going by and Mike’s going to be discussing that. But we are really having a group of people that is so talented and they’re working around the clock and for that reason I really would wish that we could report exactly what’s happened, how well we’re doing under quite adverse circumstances, but we’re doing really well. Very, very professionally handled. Our country is prepared for any circumstance. We hope it’s not going to be a major circumstance, it’ll be a smaller circumstance, but whatever the circumstances, we’re prepared. I’d like to just ask and caution that the media, we would respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved, not do anything to incite a panic because there’s no reason to panic at all."
2020-02-29,11:56,Donald Trump,"This is something that is being handled professionally. I also want to thank, by the way, governors and representatives of our various states in some cases some more than others because they’ve really been working very hard in areas where we’ve seen indication of the virus. But I want to thank the governors and all of the representatives from all of our states. The rooms they’ve made available, the speed with which they’ve worked is really been incredible. So again, thank you to everybody. I’m going to ask Mike Pence now to discuss a little bit about travel and we have some restrictions on some travel from other countries that are having a hard time. I want to thank everybody. We’ll take some questions as soon as we’re finished. Thank you very much."
2020-02-29,12:56,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. Let me begin as the President did by expressing our deepest condolences to the family of the woman in Washington state who has lost her life to the coronavirus. I want to assure that family that they’re on the hearts of every American and those that are continuing to struggle, in some cases in ICU units, can be assured of the prayers of millions of Americans. From the moment that this country learned of the spread of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump took decisive action, established the White House Coronavirus Task Force. And as the President just described, the President took unprecedented action to suspend all travel into the United States from China. Simply had never been done before by any previous administration. It is among the reasons why the threat to Americans of coronavirus remains low despite today’s tragic news from Washington state. The task force met this morning and brought the President a range of options and at his direction we will be doing the following."
2020-02-29,14:16,Mike Pence,"First, the President authorized action today to add additional travel restrictions on Iran. We will be using section 212(f), on banning travel from Iran. Iran is already under a travel ban, but we are expanding existing travel restrictions to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days. In addition to moving Iran, we are going to increase to the highest level of advisory, which is level four advising Americans do not travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea. Let me say again, the President today has authorized the State Department to increase the travel advisory for Americans to level four. We are urging Americans to not travel to the areas in Italy and the areas in South Korea that are most affected by the coronavirus. The President has also directed the State Department to work with our allies in Italy and in South Korea to coordinate a screening, a medical screening, in their countries of any individuals that are coming in to the United States of America and we look forward to working with them in a collaborative and a cooperative way."
2020-02-29,15:44,Mike Pence,"Now, with regard to the task force, I’m just a few days into this job, but I can tell you having spent time with these extraordinary professionals that the President just alluded to. Having spoken directly to more than a dozen governors, including Governor Jay Inslee this morning in Washington state, I think every American would be proud to know what I’ve heard about the work of HHS, the work of CDC, the work of all of our agencies."
2020-02-29,16:12,Mike Pence,"At the President’s direction, this team has been working seamlessly with health officials at the state and local level, and I can assure the American public that we will continue to live out the President’s admonition a few days ago, that we’re all in this together. And as we work with members of Congress, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with Republican and Democrat leadership in the Congress, we’ll be working very closely on a supplemental funding bill to make sure that not only do all these agencies have the resources that they require, but we’ll also make sure that that state and local health officials have the resources and the reimbursement to take such actions that are necessary to protect the health of the American people."
2020-02-29,16:55,Mike Pence,"The President mentioned masks this morning. We’ve talked a great deal about additional medical supplies. Let me be very clear and I’m sure the physicians who are up here will reflect this as well. The average American does not need to go out and buy a mask. But this administration is going to always put first our patients first and second, we’re going to make sure and protect the health of our healthcare providers. As the President said, we have more than 40 million masks available today. We’ve contracted now with 3M, 35 million more mass per month will be produced and we’re also going to be working with other manufacturers. In addition to that, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response will be announcing today courses of action to increase the availability of masks, as well as prioritizing availability to high-risk health care workers, modifying guidance and developing a whole of nations communications plan. President-"
2020-02-29,18:03,Mike Pence,"A whole of nations communications plan. The president wants us to be certain that our health care providers have the support they need to do their job and to do their job safely. With that, I’m going to yield the podium to the secretary of health and human services and then we’ll hear from some of our medical experts, but let me assure every American at President Trump’s direction, this is an all hands on deck effort and while the risks to Americans remain low, the president’s actions today, with regard to Iran, with regard to Italy and with South Korea and with regard to making medical supplies more available, I hope gives evidence to the fact that at his direction, we’re going to continue to lean into this effort and put the health and safety of the American people first. Mr. Secretary."
2020-02-29,18:53,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. vice president. Let me begin by on behalf of all of the officials at HHS and our whole team’s expressing our sadness for the loss of this patient in the state of Washington. Any single death for us is a real tragedy and our sympathy to her family and our solidarity with all those who are and will suffer from the novel coronavirus. From day one, this is what we predicted, this is what we expected. The risk to any average American is low from the novel coronavirus. The risk remains low thanks to the unprecedented actions President Trump has taken and the actions he’s announcing today. That risk remains low, but this can change rapidly."
2020-02-29,19:41,Unnamed,"We have always said, from the first moment that we have spoken about this, that we would see more cases. We are seeing more cases. We will see more cases, but it’s important to remember, for the vast majority of individuals who contract the novel coronavirus, they will experience mild to moderate symptoms and their treatment will be to remain at home, treating their symptoms the way they would a severe cold or the flu. For some individuals, a smaller percentage, especially those who may be medically fragile, they will require medical attention including possibly hospitalization."
2020-02-29,20:27,Alex Azar,"Our basic message, in terms of the containment of this disease and the measures that we have and are to take [inaudible 00:20:35] today announcing is we want to lower the amount of travel to and from the most impacted areas. This is a basic containment strategy. That is the philosophy behind the moves that we have taken, the moves we’re announcing today and any moves that we will consider in the future. With that said, let me turn things over to Dr. Tony Fauci, the director of the national Institute of allergy and infectious disease at NIH. Thank you very much."
2020-02-29,21:09,Alex Azar,"Thank you very much Mr. Secretary. I want to first, again as the entire team feels to extend our sympathies to the family of the individual who expired as a result of this particular virus and this particular disease, but I also want to underscore and emphasize the points that the secretary made about what is evolving here. You’ve heard of the terminology community spread. Well, community spread is when you have infection in the community in which you don’t have a direct link to a known index case. That really challenges us with something that we need to do and that we do very well. The state and local health authorities, in collaboration with the CDC, would need to identify, isolate and contact trace and that’s what’s going on right here in the country with regard to the particular area that’s involved now in Washington. The country as a whole, because we get asked that all the time, still remains at low risk, but when we say that we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation and in real time we will keep you appraised of what is going on just the same way as what we are doing it today."
2020-02-29,22:23,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"How do you address this new challenge? There’s what we do from within and what we do from without. I harken back to the original decision that was made by the president of making sure that we knew the scenario that was going on in China. We prevented travel from China to the United States. If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with. So in that spirit, the approach is going to be, as we address this challenge, which is going to evolve by the day and by the week to do what was just mentioned, to try and keep our citizens from going to places that are active infection and to prevent places where there are active infection to necessarily easily get here."
2020-02-29,23:15,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That’s the getting it from without to within. From within, we will very aggressively do the kind of public health measures that would hopefully contain this, but as we say this, we need to prepare for further challenges and we will have them. You will hear about additional cases that will be coming on. You should not be surprised by that, but to realize that that is something that is anticipated when you get communities spread. So when you have cases throughout the world, the way we’re seeing now, South Korea, Italy, Iran, and places like that, the United States cannot be completely immune to that. The challenge is how we deal with it and I can assure you all the resources that are necessary are going to be put into dealing with what we see evolving right now and again, we’d be happy to answer any questions later, but Bob, do you want to say a few words?"
2020-02-29,24:13,Bob,"I also want to add my prayers and sympathy for those that are sick and obviously our citizens that unfortunately died last night. Currently as said, there’s 22 cases in the United States and these initial cases were really leaked linked to travel to China and their context. Recently as was stated, we’ve confirmed new cases with no link to travel history or contacts and health departments under the leadership of the states and local health department supported by CDC are aggressively evaluating these cases in California, Oregon and Washington. As we said, we should anticipate to see additional cases and clusters in the days ahead and we will continue to aggressively evaluate them by the state and local and territorial tribal health departments in conjunction with CDC by embracing early case recognition, isolation, contact tracing and begin to do that to limit the further spread. I want to also add my emphasis to what was said that as we stand here today, the risk of the American public remains low. As was said, we should anticipate more cases, but again, the current risks, to the American public remains low."
2020-02-29,25:36,Unnamed,"If I could just ask you, you said the other day in the cabinet room with African American leaders, you’ve got to get away from politics. You were down in Charleston last night using the word hoax when talking about Democrats. Somebody now is dead from this, do you regret that kind of talk?"
2020-02-29,25:53,Donald Trump,"No. No. No. Hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them not… I’m not talking about what’s happening here. I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff, but the way they refer to it because these people have done such an incredible job and I don’t like it when they are criticizing these people and that’s the hoax. That’s what I’m talking about."
2020-02-29,26:31,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President and I’m just going to ask you directly about this with regard to the flow of information. From the very beginning, you received a lot of criticism regarding that in particular about Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is world renowned in contagious diseases and there were reports out there that he was being muzzled. Can you tell us that this widely respected expert, Dr. Fauci will have every opportunity to tell us the truth-"
2020-02-29,26:59,Donald Trump,That’s a very dishonest question because he has had that ability to do virtually whatever he’s wanted to do and in fact-
2020-02-29,27:08,Unnamed,So he’s not being muzzled?
2020-02-29,27:08,Donald Trump,"In fact he was never muzzled. I think I can speak… You can speak… Why don’t you speak to that? Very dishonest question, but that’s okay."
2020-02-29,27:17,Unnamed,It’s not dishonest. I wanted to clarify Mr. President. I want to clarify.
2020-02-29,27:21,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Let me clarify it. I have never been muzzled ever and I’ve been doing this since the administration of Ronald Reagan. I’m not being muzzled by this administration. What happened, which was misinterpreted, is that we were set up to go on some shows and when the vice president took over we said let’s regroup and figure out how we’re going to be communicating. So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance and when I resubmitted for clearance I got cleared so I have not been muzzled at all. That was a real misrepresentation of what happened."
2020-02-29,27:59,Unnamed,Are you considering other travel restrictions and what about closing the Southern border?
2020-02-29,28:03,Donald Trump,"We are looking also Southern border. In fact, some of the folks are here right now. [inaudible 00:28:09] is here someplace and yes, we are thinking about Southern border. We have received a lot of power on the Southern border over the last couple of years from the courts, but we are looking at that very strongly."
2020-02-29,28:26,Unnamed,"How should Americans prepare for this virus? Should they go on with their daily lives, change their routine, what should they do?"
2020-02-29,28:32,Donald Trump,"Well, I hope they don’t change their routine, but maybe Anthony, I’ll let you answer that or Bob. Do you want to answer that?"
2020-02-29,28:39,Bob,"Sure, Mr. President. Thank you. I think it’s really important that, as I said, the risk at this time is low. The American public needs to go on with their normal lives. Okay? Now we’re continuing to aggressively investigate these new community links. We’re going to continue to be transparent in relating that to the American public, but at this stage, again, the risk is low. We need to go on with our normal lives."
2020-02-29,29:03,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you very much. [inaudible 00:29:09] of the coronavirus in South Korea and to worry about the US troops in South Korea, how did you consider the [inaudible 00:00:29:16]."
2020-02-29,29:18,Donald Trump,"We care very much for the troops. We’re in constant touch with the troops. We’ve been speaking to the general, as you probably know, 32,000 troops in South Korea and that’s all working out fine and we’re in touch… We were in touch with the authorities in South Korea too."
2020-02-29,29:33,Unnamed,"What responsibility do you feel as you’re communicating about this for the public to follow your directions and to take the prudent steps and then when you did use the word hopes, who did that cause some people to not take the precautionary steps because they are linking what you’re saying when you use the word hoax in the context of coronavirus."
2020-02-29,29:55,Donald Trump,"Okay. So again, the hoax was used with respect to Democrats and what they were saying. It was a hoax what they were saying and that was very clear if you’d read the words and I think you know that too. As far as what responsibility, my great responsibility… I think the biggest decision we made was going very early and that was a decision made against a lot of people that thought we shouldn’t do that. That’s why we’re at 22 instead of a much higher number, would have been a much higher number. That was a big decision. It was a hard decision because it had never been done before anyway. I mean not even early or late, it had never been made a decision like that so that was big."
2020-02-29,30:29,Donald Trump,"My next thing is really getting the best people in the world. They’re standing behind me. These people are so talented. I’ve seen them in action now for a number of weeks actually, but for in particular for the last four or five days. I want to thank Mike Pence and everybody for the job they’re doing. We have a great team. We have great people and this too will end. Go ahead, please. Go."
2020-02-29,31:00,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you talked about people going about their routine. I did want to ask though with you and the vice president, is the white house taking any extra precautions to make sure that you don’t come in contact with the virus either through your travel or with who you meet?"
2020-02-29,31:14,Donald Trump,"Well, I think so. I mean, we lead a life. I get around. I was in South Carolina last night. We had a tremendous rally. I’ve been around. I think we’re going to be in very good shape. You know, you’re talking about 22 people right now in this whole very vast country so I think we’ll be in very good shape."
2020-02-29,31:39,Unnamed,"If I may, a couple of questions for Dr. Fauci about this [inaudible 00:31:41] virus. Dr. Fauci, what do you now understand about the morbidity. Secretary refers to the medically fragile people. Are you confident that if you’re a relatively healthy young person that this will not be fatal for you?"
2020-02-29,31:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Okay, so the N, the number in our country currently is low, but when you look at the pattern, it seems to be following the experiences that others have had. It’s never 100%. if you look at the totality of the cases that have been reported, particularly from China, about 75 to 80% of them would do really quite well. They would just sort of like a bad flu or a cold. You get anywhere from 15 to 20, 20 somewhat percent who are going to go on to require advanced medical care, hospitalization, possibly intensive care."
2020-02-29,32:31,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"For the most part, the people who get in trouble and ultimately tragically would die from this are people who are elderly and or have underlying conditions, heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, obesity because of the difficulty in breathing back and forth. However, every once in awhile you’re going to see a one off. You’re going to see a 25 year old person who looks otherwise well, that’s going to get seriously ill, but the vast majority of the people who get into trouble do have these underlying conditions and that’s why it confuses people because they say, well, you just said that, and then there’s a report of a 40 year old physician from China who died. That’s going to happen. That happens with influenza. Most of the time influenza kills people who are advanced age and underlying conditions, but you hear in the media every once in a while a college student would get infected and ultimately die, but the majority is in that risk group."
2020-02-29,33:29,Unnamed,"One more technical question. Have you determined whether there are any variants of this virus so that a person who may have gotten it and then gotten over it, could get it again?"
2020-02-29,33:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, there’s no indication that that’s going on at all. If this virus acts like other viruses, which I have no reason to believe it won’t, once you’ve gotten infected and recovered, you’re not going to get infected with the same virus."
2020-02-29,33:57,Unnamed,"I want to ask you about the peace deal in Doha between the Taliban and the US. Does this mean the war in Afghanistan is over? Is the Taliban in charge and secondly, Congressman John Radcliffe, why are you renominating him?"
2020-02-29,34:12,Donald Trump,"He’s a terrific man. He’s been fantastic and everything he’s done. He’s highly respected. He wanted to wait till after the IG report came in as you saw originally. I don’t think he was officially or formally nominated. His name was thrown out, but he wanted to wait till after the IG report. The IG report has now come and we’ve learned a lot of very bad things from the IG report as you know very well and I think he’ll go through a process and it’ll go fairly quickly. He’s very respected man. Somebody that I’ve gotten to like, somebody who really has… He’s someone who’s really distinguished himself and I think over the last year and a half, two years in particular. We’re very happy with that."
2020-02-29,34:55,Donald Trump,"As far as the Taliban is concerned, everybody wanted this to happen. The Taliban wanted it to happen. President Ghani was very much involved in this as you know and he’s now dealing with the Taliban, but we’re talking about 19 years we’ve been there, 19 years and other presidents have tried to do this. The Taliban has given a pledge and a very strong pledge and We’ll see how that all works out. We hope it’s going to work out very well. I think they have big incentives to do it, but they have to take care of the terrorists and kill the terrorists. We’ll be working in a different kind of a fashion toward that end, but the job we’ve done has been a fantastic one in terms of terrorist and terrorism and it’s time for our people to start coming home."
2020-02-29,35:45,Unnamed,"You mentioned the drop of spread in China, coronavirus cases. Is the US government considering evaluating similar measures in the US in cases-"
2020-02-29,35:53,Donald Trump,"Some measures. We’ve been in very close contact with China, including myself with President Xi. He very much wanted this to happen. He wanted us to get out and finished and be done. He worked…"
2020-02-29,36:03,Donald Trump,"Wanted this to happen. He wanted us to get out and finished and be done. He’s been working very, very hard, I can tell you that. And they’re making a lot of progress in China. You probably saw Starbucks are now opened again. You probably saw that as I mentioned, Tim just came out and he said Apple is back to normal in terms of production and their facilities in China. They’ve made a lot of progress."
2020-02-29,36:23,Unnamed,"Thank you. Thank you. Couple of questions, one of them technical. The woman who passed away, did she travel to South Korea or is she a case of community spread?"
2020-02-29,36:37,Bob,"Whoops. Yeah, the case again, this is why we’re talking about the community cases with no link to travel. So the investigation at this time shows no evidence of link to travel or a known contact."
2020-02-29,36:49,Unnamed,And also you said that Americans as a whole are at a low risk. Are Americans on the West coast of the United States at a low risk and are you considering restricting travel within the United States?
2020-02-29,37:01,Bob,"So I just want to emphasize again, that the Americans, independent of where they live in this nation are at low risk. All right? And we’re going to continue to evaluate aggressively these on link cases as we see them. And as we learn, we’ll obviously communicate that."
2020-02-29,37:16,Unnamed,"Thank you so much, Mr President. Why are you considering closing the border with Mexico, seeing that there are so many more cases here than there? And another question is, are you working with the governments from Brazil and Mexico to try to coordinate a response? Did you talk to President Bolsonaro?"
2020-02-29,37:37,Donald Trump,"Well we have a great relationship as you know with Mexico. We have 27,000 soldiers, their soldiers on our border doing a fantastic job. Our numbers are way down, people coming into our country illegally. We have ports of entry that we are keeping open and we’re not talking about it. We’re thinking about all borders. We have to think about that border. But right now that is not a border as it pertains to what we’re talking about here. This is not a border that seems to be much of a problem right now. We hope we won’t have to do that. Yes please, go ahead."
2020-02-29,38:10,Unnamed,"Mr President, if I could just follow on Afghanistan."
2020-02-29,38:10,Donald Trump,"No, no, you weren’t. Please."
2020-02-29,38:11,Unnamed,Thank you very much President. I’m just wondering what’s the communication with China look like right now and does the experience and lessons coming from China will help the US dealing with the current situation?
2020-02-29,38:21,Donald Trump,"Well I think our relationship with China is very good. We just did a big trade deal. We’re starting on another trade deal with China, a very big one and we’ve been working very closely. They’ve been talking to our people. We’ve been talking to their people having to do with the virus. No, our relationship with China is very good. Maybe it’s closer because of what’s happened here because it was… In a certain way, this can bring the world closer. If you want to know, it can really do that. Go ahead."
2020-02-29,38:45,Unnamed,"If I could just follow up. You pride yourself on a deal maker, but your former National Security Advisor, John Bolton has said that this is an Obama-style deal and sends the wrong message to ISIS and Al Qaeda. What did the Taliban give up here-"
2020-02-29,38:59,Donald Trump,Well first of all-
2020-02-29,38:59,Unnamed,"And will you be hosting the Taliban in Washington, at Camp David, or will you meet them abroad?"
2020-02-29,39:03,Donald Trump,"We’ll look at that. Look, nobody should be criticizing this deal after 19 years. He had his chance. He didn’t do it. He was very much in favor of going in. We should have never gone in, in the first place. When they went into Iraq… Listen, listen. When they went into Iraq, when they went into the Middle East in such a fashion, I was very much against it. Shouldn’t have gone in. He thought we should have. That’s been proven wrong. I’m surprised that anybody would be against something where we try and end a 19 year war. We’re 8,000 miles away from our home, we’ve done a great job in the sense that we’ve killed a lot of terrorists. We’ve put them out of commission. Who knows what they would’ve done if we didn’t do that, but it’s time for us to come home."
2020-02-29,39:46,Donald Trump,"Now the Taliban, working with other nations perhaps because you’re surrounded by other very strong nations. And whether it’s Pakistan or Iran or lots of other places including Russia, they can all work on this. We’ve been doing it for nations that are surrounding Afghanistan. Now it’s time for us to start coming home. And I think it’s a very good situation. President Ghani is working on it very hard. We’ll see how that works out. But the United States has done great services for people all over the world, that frankly I don’t think they’ve been given really the kind of respect that they should be given for what we’ve done. What we have done for the world is incredible and usually we don’t even get a thank you."
2020-02-29,40:33,Donald Trump,"In Afghanistan, we did something and I will tell you for the most part I noticed he was negative, but he should have tried to do something better. He was here for a year. He could have done something better. I was all ears and he wasn’t able to do that. The deal has a chance to be extremely good, but what it does do is we start bringing our people back home. Yeah. No, no. Go ahead."
2020-02-29,40:59,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr President. The other day you spoke about the impact, the financial impact, the economic impact of the coronavirus on our country. Yesterday there was a letter that was sent out publicly by the Federal Reserve chairman talking about steps that the Fed may do to prevent economic impacts to happening here in the United States."
2020-02-29,41:19,Donald Trump,Good it’s about time.
2020-02-29,41:20,Unnamed,"What’s your reaction? Is that enough, that kind of a letter?"
2020-02-29,41:22,Donald Trump,"No I think the Fed has a very important role and especially psychological. I mean if you look at the… The Fed has a massive impact. Lots of it is psychological and lots of it is fact. This is something I think they should have done even beyond this and before this because other countries that are not as nearly as prime, we’re the greatest in the world. It’s our currency, everything, we have everything. We should have the lowest interest rates. We don’t have the lowest interest rates. Our Fed rate is higher. You look at Germany, you look at Japan, you look at other countries, many of them have negative rates. And we are not put in that position because of our Fed and now we have this problem. You saw where Germany is lowering and also infusing a lot of money into their economy, a tremendous amount."
2020-02-29,42:10,Donald Trump,"I haven’t heard our Fed say they should do this. Our Fed should start being a leader, not a follower. Our Fed has been a follower. We need a Fed that’s going to be a leader. We should have at least the same rates and ideally lower rates than other countries. We shouldn’t be paying more, but we’re forced to pay more on interest and we are the most prime. Think of it, biggest economy in the world by far. China would have overtaken us and this year they were expected to for five years. 2019 they were going to overtake us. They’re not even close and they won’t be close. As long as somebody smart is right here, they won’t be close."
2020-02-29,42:47,Donald Trump,"But I will say this, relationship with them is good. But as far as the Fed is concerned, our Fed should be a leader. Our Fed has not been a leader at all. Frankly, we could refinance our debt at even lower rates. The rates are very low, but we should be refinancing debt at even lower rates. Our Fed is making us pay more than we should and that’s ridiculous."
2020-02-29,43:10,Unnamed,I have a question about the economy.
2020-02-29,43:11,Unnamed,Thank you Mr President. Thank you. You mentioned you’re having the meeting on Monday with the pharmaceutical executives.
2020-02-29,43:18,Donald Trump,Right.
2020-02-29,43:18,Unnamed,"As you know, the process of approving medicines is complex and time consuming."
2020-02-29,43:25,Donald Trump,I think this process will go very quickly.
2020-02-29,43:26,Unnamed,What powers will you use-
2020-02-29,43:27,Donald Trump,"I think Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative, this process is going to go very quickly. And you know that-"
2020-02-29,43:33,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:07:32].
2020-02-29,43:34,Donald Trump,Excuse me?
2020-02-29,43:34,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:07:35].
2020-02-29,43:36,Donald Trump,Yeah. We can do that. Want to do that?
2020-02-29,43:38,Mike Pence,We’re expedited.
2020-02-29,43:39,Donald Trump,Okay. Would you like to say something? All right.
2020-02-29,43:42,Unnamed,Excuse me for interrupting.
2020-02-29,43:43,Unnamed,And the private companies too that you’re talking about.
2020-02-29,43:47,Unnamed,"So we are working very diligently with industry. We’re using our authorities in an expedited fashion to help with the development of therapeutics, particularly around the coronavirus. As you probably know, we issued a policy this morning that allows us to have a lot of flexibility around the development of diagnostic tests. Our colleagues at the CDC have done a great job to have an increase in those tests and we expect this policy to have a significant impact on that as well. Thanks."
2020-02-29,44:15,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:44:15] with the markets?
2020-02-29,44:21,Donald Trump,"By the way, the meeting with the pharmaceutical companies was actually set up before over drug pricing because we want prices to go way down, but it turns out to be a very convenient meeting as it pertains to the vaccine."
2020-02-29,44:35,Unnamed,So you’ll talk about both?
2020-02-29,44:35,Donald Trump,We’ll talk about both.
2020-02-29,44:35,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr President. You put the Vice President in charge of coronavirus coordination across the government. When he was governor of Indiana, the Vice President allowed an HIV outbreak to spiral out of control because he did not heed the advice of his public health professional advisors who said that needle exchange was necessary at the beginning of the outbreak. What guarantee can you give Americans that political considerations and ideological issues will play no role in your government’s response to this virus?"
2020-02-29,45:12,Donald Trump,"Well let me just respond quickly and then I’m going to have Mike say something about that because I’ve heard pretty good explanations actually. When it came to healthcare, Indiana has been a leader, an absolute leader, and it was really started with others, but by Mike Pence. And he’s done a phenomenal job on healthcare. One of the best, if not the best in the country. And with that, I’ll let Mike respond specifically if you want to."
2020-02-29,45:37,Mike Pence,"Sure. Thank you Mr President. When I was governor of the state of Indiana, we actually had two experiences with the spread of infectious diseases. The first was in 2014 when Indiana was where the very first MERS case in the United States arrived. Obviously an infectious disease, much more deadly than the coronavirus that we’re dealing with today. It was then when I was governor that I learned of the extraordinary capabilities of CDC. I worked with my health officials in the state of Indiana, worked with federal officials, and maybe most importantly, learned the invaluable role that local health officials play in dealing with the spread of infectious disease."
2020-02-29,46:20,Mike Pence,"I’m proud to say that the state of Indiana secured that patient, found out everyone they’d ever contacted. There were no additional infections and that patient recovered. There was only one other MERS disease. The other incident was in 2015. We had an outbreak of HIV in a very small town that emerged in early 2015. My health officials came to me, we immediately deployed health resources, but the truth was is HIV AIDS was being spread by people sharing needles and intravenous drug use. And the state of Indiana did not allow for providing a needle exchange to citizens. But the CDC came in and made a recommendation and I declared a public health emergency and made for 30 days a needle exchange available in the state of Indiana."
2020-02-29,47:13,Mike Pence,"And I’m proud to say that every one of those patients was treated. We ended the spread of the HIV AIDS virus in that community. But again, as I’ve said before, I think as President and I have discussed, I think my experience as a governor dealing with two different infectious diseases and seeing the vital role that local healthcare providers play, that federal officials play, has really informed me. It’s one of the reasons why I’ve been spending a lot of time talking to governors. I met yesterday with state health officials and the governor in Florida. And I’m proud of the work that did in the state of Indiana and I hope to continue to bring all of the best minds together to deal with this issue."
2020-02-29,47:59,Donald Trump,"Great answer and he’s doing a great job. Go ahead. He’s doing a great job. Great answer, thank you. Go ahead."
2020-02-29,48:06,Unnamed,"Two days ago, 36 Turkey soldiers were killed in Syria. And today Turkish-"
2020-02-29,48:12,Donald Trump,When was that? When?
2020-02-29,48:13,Unnamed,Two days ago.
2020-02-29,48:14,Donald Trump,Okay.
2020-02-29,48:14,Unnamed,And today Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey wants Patriot air defenses from United States. Are you in talk with Turkish government?
2020-02-29,48:25,Donald Trump,We’re speaking to President Erdogan a lot and we are talking to him about exactly what you’re referring to.
2020-02-29,48:35,Unnamed,Are you able to do anything from a policy or a reassurance standpoint to try to deal with-
2020-02-29,48:41,Donald Trump,The markets will all come back. The markets are very strong. The consumer is unbelievably strong. The companies are very strong. We have one problem. We have to get this problem brought into focus and it is right now I think our professionals are doing a great job. I’m not thinking in terms.
2020-02-29,48:58,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:12:59].
2020-02-29,48:58,Donald Trump,"Well it’s certainly not a good situation. When you lose travel, that’s a big part of market. But for a period of time we’re going to have to do whatever’s necessary. Safety, health, number one. And the markets will take care of themselves. The companies are very powerful. Our consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now. Larry Kudlow was telling me before that the numbers… I said don’t even bring it up, what difference? But the numbers are very strong. He’s got numbers from Friday. Very strong. You see the numbers. But our focus is on exactly this. It’s not on that. That will take care of itself."
2020-02-29,49:34,Unnamed,Are you considering any tax breaks to help ease the pain?
2020-02-29,49:39,Donald Trump,"I think the big thing we’re looking for is the Fed to do its job. If the Fed does its job, that’s what we are really looking for. Where prior to this, as you know we announced that we’re going to be at the end of the year. We’re going to be toward the end of the year, we’re going to be announcing a middle income tax cut. In order to get that through, I don’t think the Democrats are going to be approving any tax cuts because they like to raise taxes instead of lower taxes. But we’ll be in the not too distant future announcing a very major middle income tax cut. Okay? Ladies and gentleman, thank you. Go ahead please."
2020-02-29,50:16,Unnamed,People started to buy hand sanitizer and food supplies and also medical supplies to prepare. And there are some of the items that are out of stock. Do you think they should get prepared on those so-
2020-02-29,50:28,Donald Trump,I think it’s always good to be prepared. I think it’s always good. But we are super prepared. When you hear 43 million masks as an example. I will do one more. Go ahead the gentleman.
2020-02-29,50:40,Unnamed,"It has been reported yesterday that you are willing at this point to meet with leaders of Russia, China, the UK and France."
2020-02-29,50:48,Donald Trump,Correct.
2020-02-29,50:48,Unnamed,To discuss arms control issues among other things.
2020-02-29,50:52,Donald Trump,"We all want to discuss arms control and that’s a wise thing. We’re spending now over $20 billion on nuclear and on the super speed missiles and many other things. And they have come to me and they all want to now discuss arms control. And that includes China and that includes Russia and I think it’s very smart of them to want to do it and I think it’s very smart of us to want to do it. And we will be discussing that in New York. One final question. Go ahead. No, no, please."
2020-02-29,51:22,Unnamed,When do you anticipate troops will be returning? How soon do you see them returning in this US Taliban agreement? How soon do expect troops to be coming back?
2020-02-29,51:32,Donald Trump,"Like today. Okay. Today. They’ll start immediately. So ladies and gentlemen, we’ll be doing this quite often. We’re going to keep you abreast of all of the facts and again, I want to thank the professionals. They are great professionals. I’ve gotten to really know them and see them under very interesting and tough and trying conditions. We have the finest in the world. I will say this, other countries call us and they ask would it be possible for them to speak to Anthony and Bob and the people that you’re talking to on a daily basis now. So we’re going to be very transparent. We’ll be meeting you probably tomorrow or the next day. We’ll keep you abreast. Thank you very much."
2020-02-29,52:10,Unnamed,Thank you Mr President. Is traveling to Washington state okay?
2020-02-29,52:17,Unnamed,Yes it is. Because you mentioned that… I want to make sure we answer that question.
2020-02-29,52:23,Unnamed,And California. Can we travel to California?
2020-02-29,52:25,Bob,"I just want to echo again, that the risk is low."
2020-02-29,52:29,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. Secretary.
2020-02-29,52:30,Bob,"The risk is low. I encourage Americans to go about their life. That includes travel to California, Oregon, and state of Washington. And we will continue to have aggressive public health response with our state and local territorial health departments to get a better understanding of these community cases that we’ve now begun to see."
2020-02-29,52:52,Unnamed,Thank you very much. Thank you.
2020-03-02,02:18,Mike Pence,"Good afternoon. We just finished the Monday meeting of the White House coronavirus task force. Since the time the President established the task force here at the White House, it has literally met daily and we continued that effort today. We added the Head of the Center for Medicaid Medicare Services, Seema Verma to the task force today as well as Robert Wilkie with the V.A. First, a few basic facts and reports and then we’ll hear from other members of the task force about ongoing efforts. At the present moment, we have 43 domestic cases of the coronavirus, 48 cases of individuals who’ve returned to the United States. Of the domestic cases, 29 of the 43 are either in California or Washington state and we have communities that are facing what the experts tell us could potentially be a cluster in those communities. Sadly today, there were four additional fatalities, raising the number that six Americans have lost their life to the coronavirus and on behalf of the President and all of the American people, we extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of those that were lost."
2020-03-02,03:43,Mike Pence,"Despite today’s sad news, let’s be clear, the risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low according to all of the experts that we’re working with across the government. And as the President has said, we’re ready for anything, but this is an all hands on deck effort. Today’s activity really reflects the President’s effort to bring the best minds of private industry together, the best leadership from around the country at every level. We had a good meeting this morning with governors from 50 states and three territories. I was able to convey to them the gratitude that the President and our entire administration feels, particularly for governors that are dealing with the coronavirus in their states, those that have taken repatriated personnel. I can say that what I hear from the nation’s governors is that there has been a seamless relationship between all the agencies that the federal government and states thus far and we’re encouraged to hear that. But I told them that we are committed to a full partnership with state governments and to their health officials and to local healthcare providers going forward."
2020-03-02,05:04,Mike Pence,"We also met today with some of the leaders of the top pharmaceutical companies in the country. The President spoke to them not just about vaccines, which many of the companies are already beginning to work on, but just as importantly, the development of therapeutics and it is remarkable to think that there may well be a vaccine going to clinical trials within the next six weeks. The nature of trials as the experts have explained to us is that the vaccine might yet not be available till late this year or early next. But the therapeutics, giving relief to people that contract the coronavirus could literally be available by this summer or early fall. The most encouraging news from that meeting was that our pharmaceutical companies, which are recognized as the greatest in the world, all have already formed a consortium to work together to share information in the development of therapeutics and vaccines. A quick update, yesterday, we were fully implementing the new travel advisories for portions of Italy and South Korea. And the implementation of screening of personnel from across those countries who are trying to take a direct flight to the United States of America."
2020-03-02,06:27,Mike Pence,"I was pleased in the White House task force meeting today to learn that within the next 12 hours there will be 100% screening all direct flights at all airports across Italy and across South Korea. The President has directed us to bring the full resources of the federal government and to bring the very best minds in this country to bear on this effort. And finally, today I’m pleased to welcome to our White House team, a world-renowned global health official and a physician. She will be my right arm through this effort as the President has tasked me to lead the White House response to the coronavirus and I’m grateful that Ambassador Deborah Birx, also Dr. Deborah Birx will be on our team. And even on her first day, she’s already been contributing significantly to our discussions. Dr. Birx serves as the U.S. government’s leader today for combating HIV/AIDS globally and has developed an international reputation as that. She’s a scientist, a physician, someone with three decades of public health expertise including very virulent diseases, vaccines, and has vast experience in inter agency coordination."
2020-03-02,07:51,Mike Pence,"And Dr. Birx and I have talked about the importance of bringing all of these various entities together to bring about President Trump’s vision for a whole of government response to the coronavirus. And so with that, I’d like to recognize Dr. Deborah Birx for a few introductory and welcome remarks and thank you for stepping up one more time to serve our country."
2020-03-02,08:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. Thank you Mr. Vice President. It’s a pleasure to be here. I just arrived from South Africa last night. Everybody took great care of being … I had computer and phone in record time. It really shows the level of efficiency and expertise here to really get moving quickly. It’s clear that the early work of the President, both with travel restrictions and the ability to quarantine has bought us this time and space to have this task force be very effective. I have never worked with such incredible scientists and thoughtful policy leaders and I got to spend the day with them. I’m trying to get up to speed as fast as possible and I look forward to the days ahead really working together to end this epidemic. Thank you."
2020-03-02,08:55,Mike Pence,Great. Secretary Azar.
2020-03-02,08:59,Alex Azar,"Well, thank you Mr. Vice President. I just want to first start out by saying how delighted we are that Ambassador Birx is going to be leading, coordinating these efforts across the government. Dr. Birx and I go way back, Dr. Birx and basically every leader at the Department of Health and Human Services go way back together, so we already have established relationships and maybe not too way back, right? We already have very established, productive working relationships that I think are going to keep the inter agency process working incredibly smoothly. And as the Vice President said, Dr. Birx already has been asking the right questions and challenging us on all the right scientific and policy matters that we need to focus on. I just want to begin by recapping the current situation that we face with COVID-19. As the Vice President mentioned as of this morning, we have 43 confirmed or presumptive cases of the virus in the United States, excluding our repatriated cases."
2020-03-02,09:57,Alex Azar,"17 of those cases are travel related in one way or another. 26 are believed to be person to person spread. Because of the President’s strong leadership and all of the hard work that our public health professionals have done at the local, the state, the federal level, the immediate risk to any individual American has been and does continue to be low. But the risk for people with possible exposure to identified cases can be high. What every one of our experts and leaders have been saying for more than a month now remains true. The degree of risk has the potential to change quickly, especially if we see sustained spread of the disease around the world, which could qualify this disease as a pandemic. As Dr. Fauci said this morning, we will see more cases of community spread in the United States. As we’ve emphasized for some time now, we all need to prepare for the potential need, prepare for the worst, hope for the best."
2020-03-02,10:59,Alex Azar,"In some places we will have to use the range of our mitigation efforts. In fact, we already are working closely with Santa Clara County and the State of Washington and particular King County to assist them in thinking through some of the best practices from our pandemic action plan, as well as learnings from Singapore and Hong Kong around the most effective community mitigation efforts. Such as temporary school closures or even more titrated responses Dr. Schuchat has talked to you about, such as having school but perhaps not having assemblies in school. That’s why the President has taken an unprecedented whole of government approach to protecting the American people, including the steps in the last few days to radically expand and improve the testing that we have and to improve access to respirators needed by healthcare workers. The Vice President, Dr. Schuchat of the C.D.C. and I spoke with basically almost every governor that we have this morning and we greatly appreciate their close cooperation with us. I also wanted to now introduce-"
2020-03-02,12:03,Alex Azar,"I also wanted to now introduce an individual who I asked the vice president to have join this task force because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services play such a vital role, $1.3 trillion of spending here in the United States, providing healthcare to 60 million American seniors, and as we’ve seen, this disease can have a disproportionate severity impact on the elderly, as well as the medically frail. And so Seema Verma, our administrator, has a very important responsibility with regard to funding of care, whether it’s therapeutics or vaccines or diagnostics for our senior citizens, but also a vital role that you may not know of in regulating long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and other healthcare facilities. Very important regulatory function, so I’m delighted that Administrator Verma is formally joining the task force."
2020-03-02,13:01,Alex Azar,And let me turn it over to Seema now. Seema.
2020-03-02,13:05,Seema Verma,"Thank you, Secretary Azar. For the Trump administration and CMS, patients come first, and the health and the safety and welfare of America’s patients and provider workforce is our highest priority. Let me start with what CMS is, and as the secretary said, we are the nation’s largest insurer, covering over 130 million Americans between Medicare, Medicaid, and the individual insurance market. And some of these are our nation’s most vulnerable populations, those in poverty, the elderly, and children, and so forth. Critically, we do have a regulatory responsibility for pretty much every healthcare institution in America. This includes facilities such as hospitals, critical access hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, dialysis facilities, surgery centers, and the list goes on."
2020-03-02,13:55,Seema Verma,"And that gives us a very critical role in addressing the coronavirus. We are responsible for enforcing the quality guidelines based in part on information from partner agents like the CDC. And so let me stress that CMS has longstanding infectious disease policies already in place that we have used effectively for other outbreaks, such as influenza. And so healthcare facilities already have these procedures in place and should be prepared for what they may see. And we’re going to continue to proactively update our regulations. We’re going to be working with CDC. Right now, like I said, those are already in place, and it’s our job to make sure that healthcare facilities are effectively implementing those guidelines, and we will work with the CDC to determine whether we need to update or change those."
2020-03-02,14:46,Seema Verma,"Also, we are looking at what we cover in clarifying the types of products and services that our programs will be able to pay for in terms of Medicaid and Medicare. And with that, I’ll turn it over."
2020-03-02,14:58,Mike Pence,That’s very good.
2020-03-02,14:58,Seema Verma,Thank you.
2020-03-02,15:03,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Seema. Thank you for stepping up. I want to recognize a couple other members of our team. Tony Fauci. National Institute of Health. Thank you, doctor."
2020-03-02,15:11,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. I just want to make three comments and points. First of all, to underscore what the vice president, and with Secretary Azar said, we had a really extraordinary meeting with the CEOs, a variety of individuals in the pharmaceutical and biotech business, several of whom in the room were people we’re actually already actively collaborating with. And their enthusiasm about getting involved and helping us along with the development of products and the availability of products, be they vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, or therapeutics. It was very gratifying."
2020-03-02,15:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Second, I’m very pleased that the president and vice president will be visiting the NIH tomorrow. We’re going to have the opportunity to show them firsthand, in real time, the kinds of things that we’re doing. And finally, just one comment about Ambassador Dr. Birx. A couple of people up here have said, you know, I go back a long time with Dr. Birx. Nobody goes back as long as I go with Ambassador Birk. She was actually a fellow in my program as a trainee, and we knew she was a star then, and now what has happened over the years, she’s become a superstar. Together, we saw the first patients with HIV back in the early ’80s. We were involved in a vaccine trial that was the first successful trial with HIV. We’ve known each other through PEPFAR. I had the privilege and the honor, among others, of putting together the PEPFAR program for President Bush, and she was the ambassador in charge of the PEPFAR program, so I can’t tell you how excited I am to finally, once again, get back in being a partner with Debbie Birx."
2020-03-02,16:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,Thank you.
2020-03-02,16:50,Mike Pence,"Great. Thank you, Dr. Fauci. And finally, Dr. Bob Redfield, CDC. Bob."
2020-03-02,16:56,Bob Redfield,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. What I would like to do is just recognize that CDC continues to work and provide support to really the backbone of our public health system in this nation, which is the state, local, tribal, and territory health departments. And these teams continue to work to identify new cases, isolate and contact trace these, together, to work together to try to limit the transmission of the coronavirus. And working with our public health partners, we continue to be able to identify new community cases, as the secretary said, we always anticipated, and use our public health assets to aggressively, again, confirm those cases, isolate, do contact tracing to use our public health tools to limit the spread of this virus."
2020-03-02,17:56,Bob Redfield,"I want to echo what was said by the vice president and the secretary, that despite seeing these new community cases, that shows you we have a public health community across this country in action. The risk to the American people is low. I also want to add my, looking forward, and I know my entire agency is looking forward to the president and the vice president’s and the secretary’s visit, to come to Atlanta on Friday and get to meet a lot of the wonderful people that form the backbone of this great agency. Thank you."
2020-03-02,18:29,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Bob. We’ll take a few questions. Steve Holland, Reuters. Where are you, Steve?"
2020-03-02,18:35,Steve Holland,"Based on what you’ve seen so far, how quickly do you expect this virus to spread throughout the United States?"
2020-03-02,18:44,Mike Pence,"Let me, let me refer that to the experts. Go ahead, Bob."
2020-03-02,18:48,Steve Holland,Are there any details about this cluster in Washington State that [inaudible 00:18:51].
2020-03-02,18:52,Bob Redfield,"I think the important thing is, the secretary has said, from the beginning, we’ve anticipated to see community cases pop up, and now we have a number of new community cases, which the health departments are aggressively evaluating, to see if they can understand the linkage, who are the contacts, how is this virus spreading. And I think the American public should rest assured, we have one of the finest public health programs in the world, when you look at the state and local, territorial. So we’re going to continue to see these cases as a consequence of them doing their job. And we’re going to use the public health strategies that we can to limit that transmission."
2020-03-02,19:31,Bob Redfield,"And I think we should focus on that right now. We’re still working very hard and trying to contain these community outbreaks, but as the secretary has said, we are blending that now with various strategic mitigation strategies."
2020-03-02,19:44,Mike Pence,Dr. Fauci.
2020-03-02,19:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Just to underscore something I said the other day, there are two aspects of this. It’s about cases coming in, and then controlling the situation of the spread of what’s already in here. And there are two things that are going on. It’s the kind of restrictions of travel to areas where there are hotspots in the rest of the world. Just like the original inhibition of travel here with China, I think is going to mitigate against the question of the wider spread."
2020-03-02,20:11,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And the contact tracing and the isolation that’s very aggressively going on. I mean, we hope, you can never predict 100% of anything. But I think what’s going on right now with the CDC, and particularly, the state and local health authorities is going to really, I think, get us through this."
2020-03-02,20:28,Mike Pence,"Steve, it’s something I learned along the way is that when we have cases that emerge, state and local health officials are in the lead, but CDC is on the ground immediately, helping to identify how that might have originated with that individual, to find out any other people that they’ve been exposed to. But we know there will be more cases. President initially took unprecedented action to do all that we could to prevent the coronavirus from coming into the country, and now we’re focused on mitigation of the spread, as well as treatment of the people that are affected."
2020-03-02,21:04,Mike Pence,"Kristin Fisher. Kristin Fisher here? Oh, she walked out? Let me go, let me go with Hallie Jackson."
2020-03-02,21:12,Hallie Jackson,"Thank you. Two questions for you, sir, and if anybody else wants to jump in. Number one, President Trump hinted today at the potential for new travel restrictions on top of what we’re already seeing, related to Italy, South Korea, China, Iran. Can you elaborate on specifically what countries you’re looking at? Is Germany, for example, which has seen some cases of community spread, is that on the table? And then I have a follow-up, as well."
2020-03-02,21:33,Mike Pence,"The president is very clear. We’re going to follow the facts and listen to the experts every step of the way. The action the president authorized this weekend, raising the travel advisory. The American people should know that we are saying that you should not travel to certain sections of Italy or South Korea. Those advisories may expand, but we’ll allow the caseload in those countries to define that. In addition to that, by establishing the screening protocol, which will be in full force and effect within the next 12 hours, in both countries, will ensure that anyone traveling on a direct flight to the United States of America receives multiple screenings at all airports in Italy and South Korea."
2020-03-02,22:23,Mike Pence,"But, to your point, the nature of the European Union is one doesn’t require a passport to move around, so our task force spoke today about new cases, and there were some in several European countries. We’re following that very closely, and again, we’ll listen to the experts. We’ll watch the cases, and I know the president will make the decisions with regard to both travel advisories or restrictions on the basis of those facts."
2020-03-02,22:54,Hallie Jackson,"And my second question, sir, is just on the word pandemic. Do you, do your experts behind you here, do you consider this now a pandemic in all but designation only?"
2020-03-02,23:03,Mike Pence,"I would just refer to the experts that, our view is that would be for the World Health Organization to define, and our team, our task force team, was in touch with the World Health Organization today."
2020-03-02,23:15,Alex Azar,Do you want me to mention that?
2020-03-02,23:17,Mike Pence,"Let me let the secretary address that. But this isn’t so much about semantics. I think our briefing today was we’re in more than 60 countries at this point. And so, we’re going to continue to focus on ensuring that we do all we can to prevent people coming into the country with the disease, to mitigate any spread of the disease once we identify cases, and of course, to provide treatment. Did you want to speak to that?"
2020-03-02,23:43,Alex Azar,"You bet, Mr. Vice President. I spoke with Dr. Tedros today, and Dr. Mike Ryan, the incident manager for the World Health Organization, about this precise question, because wanted to get a sense of their thinking, how they’re assessing the designation of pandemic status. And I’ll let them fully speak for themselves, but at the moment, while we’re seeing community spreading in multiple-"
2020-03-02,24:03,Unnamed,"And while we’re seeing community spreading in multiple regions of the world, there are many definitions that people use around pandemic. And one issue that the WHO is focused on is just sheer magnitude. And while we’ve had very large numbers of cases and spreading within China, the actual absolute number of cases outside of China, while reflecting community spreading, are not of the magnitude comparable to any other pandemics that had been declared before. For instance, even the H1N1 where you have billions of individuals infected across the world. So that’s how they are thinking about this. And we’re just going to keep working with them. We don’t have a view as to whether they should designate it a pandemic or not a pandemic. I made that very clear. I just wanted to get a sense how they’re thinking about it and assessing it, and that’s, I think, reflective of their current thinking there. But I’ll let them, I asked them if they could put out some points about how they’re assessing this stuff."
2020-03-02,25:00,Unnamed,Can you take a follow up to that?
2020-03-02,25:00,Mike Pence,"Good answer. Good answer. Hang on. How about Ben with ABC, where are you Ben? Go ahead."
2020-03-02,25:03,Ben,"On screening passengers from Italy and South Korea. What exactly would that screening look like? Is that people taking temperatures? Is that every single passenger? Who will be conducting it, and will it be expanded to other countries? And then how many number … how many tests have been conducted? Last week I believe Secretary Azar said there were 3,600. What’s an update on that?"
2020-03-02,25:27,Mike Pence,"Well, let me just … Our State Department and an interagency group has worked out that arrangement with both Italy and South Korea. South Korea actually about three hours ago fully implemented the screening on all direct flights, all airports. And as I mentioned, within the next 12 hours or so Italy will have implemented the same thing. It will be multiple temperature checks in the airports for people before they are boarding. And we’re working very closely to assist them in implementing that."
2020-03-02,26:10,Mike Pence,"But let me speak about … yeah, Doctor Hahn can speak to you about the status of tests because one of the things I heard from governors last week was the whole issue of of test kits, the availability of testing, and I really want to commend Doctor Hahn and the FDA for some very swift work, making many more tests available, more kits that include multiple tests, and also authorizing local testing, which will now make it more possible, as our experts told us, to identify additional cases. As we find more cases, it will mean our health officials are doing their job in large part, and the availability of those tests will contribute to that."
2020-03-02,26:57,Dr. Steven Hahn,"As you heard from the Secretary and the Vice President this weekend, we had the capacity in state public health labs to perform between 75,000 and 100,000 tests. On Saturday we issued a new policy allowing us to have some flexibility, regulatory flexibility, around the development of those tests, so academic centers, private companies can develop these tests, tell us that they validated those tests, and then begin to use them. They alert us of that, and then later on within 15 days we can look at the validation data. They’re having the responsibility to show the validation of those tests. With this new policy we’ve heard from multiple companies and multiple academic centers, and we expect to have a substantial increase in the number of tests this week, next week, and throughout the month. There’ll be a sig- the estimates that we’re getting from industry right now, by the end of this week, close to a million tests will be able to be performed."
2020-03-02,27:47,Ben,"Okay. Real quick follow up with the list and we’re talking about risk and you guys came out and said that, well, risk is low, but with so few tests being done and the incubation rate being as much as two weeks, how can we accurately say that the risk is low at this point? We haven’t put out a million tests. [inaudible 00:28:07]."
2020-03-02,28:11,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"If you talk about the entire country, the whole 360 million people in this country, the risk is a low risk. I think the point you’re making is that since we haven’t done yet, but will happen really soon, the testing into the community, how do we know the risk is low? I would imagine it’s still going to be low regardless of that. What happens in real time, which is the reason why we do this so frequently, is that things can change. But right now, today, on this day, Monday, if you look at the country as a whole, the risk is low."
2020-03-02,28:47,Unnamed,"All right, guys, last question."
2020-03-02,28:47,Mike Pence,"We’ve got one more. Ashley. Go right ahead, Ashley."
2020-03-02,28:49,Ashley,"Families across the country are worried about spring break, they’re worried about spring break and wondering if they should book travel or cancel their travel. It’s sort of two parts. One is what is the expert opinion from the task force on sort of spring break travel and even domestic travel? And secondly, would you yourself feel comfortable bringing your family right now, including your three grandchildren and their partners, on a week-long trip to Disney World?"
2020-03-02,29:13,Mike Pence,"Well, I can say there’s been no recommendation about any limitations on travel within the United States of America. But let me let the experts speak to recommendations with regard to travel. You want to get that?"
2020-03-02,29:28,Ashley,Would you feel comfortable bringing-
2020-03-02,29:30,Mike Pence,"I travel across this country all the time. My kids live all over the country. Look, this is a time to use common sense. It’s a good time to wash your hands and, but this time of year, that’s always a good decision. But as we said, the risk remains low. And while we’ve had a tragic losses, four today, the reality is, as I said, 29 of the 43 domestic cases are in California and in Washington State and are centered in very specific areas that we’re working to identify the source on. But I don’t, I think people should just continue to use common sense this time of year. But with regard to international travel, let me yield to the expert."
2020-03-02,30:21,Dr. Redfield,"Well, I just want to echo what the Vice President said, that we want people to go about and live their normal lives in this nation right now. The Secretary’s right, even before the coronavirus, if you had asked CDC what you should do about preparedness, we would give that every individual should think ahead and prepare. Whether it’s a hurricane. Those recommendations haven’t changed. And I really want people to reflect that. In going to, you’re allowed, there’s no travel restrictions in the United States."
2020-03-02,30:53,Dr. Redfield,"The CDC and the State Department and the task force have worked hard to recognize those areas where there’s significant community transmission, where we give you advice that we would recommend you not travel there. And you know that China is that. We now have South Korea as a level three. We have Italy, Japan and Iran as level three travel advisories, which we would ask you to reconsider those travel plans. But in the United States there’s no travel restrictions. I want to echo again what everyone said. The risk to the American public at this point is low. We are going to increase substantially surveillance similar to what we do for flu. We have multiple different surveillance systems with Doctor Hahn and the FDA getting more and more tests out. Those surveillance systems are going to be activated in the near future. And we’ll have eyes on whether there is any significant new evidence of community pockets around this nation."
2020-03-02,31:53,Mike Pence,"Ashley, with regard to international travel. We just, we’ll continue to monitor the cases. We’ll follow the facts, the experts in the science, and determine whether additional travel advisories or restrictions are warranted. That being said, folks, we’re going to slip out. We will be back. Let me tell you, we will be back here. If I may. We’ll be back here every day. Get used to seeing us. We’re going to bring the experts in. We’re going to make sure and give you the best and most high quality real time information from the best people in the world. So thank you all for being here."
2020-03-02,32:32,Unnamed,Thank you. You’re welcome back any time.
2020-03-02,32:34,Unnamed,(silence)
2020-03-05,00:00,Mike Pence,"Well, we just completed another meeting of the White House, coronavirus task force. It’s been a very busy and a productive day here at the White House. President Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and health of the American people and president has directed our task force, employing the full resources of the federal government in full partnership with state and local health authorities to make that priority a reality."
2020-03-05,00:34,Mike Pence,"As I stand before you today, we have more than 100 coronavirus cases in the United States that is counting domestic cases and cases of coronavirus of Americans that were returned from China or the Diamond Princess. I’m pleased to report that most of those who contracted coronavirus within our care are continuing to recover, but sadly, we received word today that another American has passed away and their family has our deepest condolences."
2020-03-05,01:10,Mike Pence,"That being said, thanks to president’s strong leadership and the professionalism of all of our federal agencies, Health and Human Services, CDC and state and local health officials all across this country, the risk to the American public of contracting the coronavirus remains low. To be clear. If you are a healthy American, the risk of contracting the coronavirus remains low, but it is still a good idea to engage in common sense practices that are always recommended this time of year. So as someone who has a mother who is 87 years of age and who has married kids living around the country, a brief tutorial on prevention for yourself, for your family and your loved ones."
2020-03-05,02:17,Mike Pence,"It’s a good idea to stay home when you’re sick. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Cover your cough or sneeze with tissue. Throw the tissue in the trash, clean and disinfect frequently. Wash your hands with either a disinfectant or with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. And let me say again, as we’ve said before, there’s no need for Americans to buy masks. And the common sense practices that I just described are all available at cdc.gov."
2020-03-05,02:58,Mike Pence,"Today we had a series of meetings here at the White House and on Capitol Hill we’ve met with executives of the airline industry, the executives of commercial labs, executives of nursing homes, and our team also met with the Republican and Democrat caucuses in the House of Representatives. And we were pleased to learn that just shortly ago the House of Representatives passed a federal funding bill by a virtually unanimous margin. It’ll now move to the Senate and the legislation implements the president’s vision to ensure that not only do our federal agencies have the support and resources that they need, but also that our state and local partners have their support. And in my conversations with governors all the way through this afternoon, I know they’re grateful for the bipartisan spirit that has characterized this funding bill and we’ll continue to work through that process."
2020-03-05,03:52,Mike Pence,"As President Trump said, we’re all in this together and he deployed a whole of government approach, but thanks to the president’s leadership, it has actually developed into a whole of America approach. And the meetings today with industry leaders is a reflection of that. As Dr. Birx will indicate in just a few moments with some of the data that we’re evaluating from around the world. It does appear that the elderly are the most vulnerable and especially those with serious health issues. At the president’s direction. As a result, Seema Verma will describe that the center for Medicaid and Medicare services has issued new guidelines for nursing homes nationwide. We have raised the bar regarding infectious disease control in our nursing homes and in addition administrator Verma will explain how we are going to focus all of our inspection resources for the foreseeable future on compliance with infection control standards. Generally we monitor our nursing homes for abuse and neglect, but at the president’s direction we’re going to focus exclusively on ensuring that those who are in nursing homes, people operating the nursing homes, like many of the CEOs that we met with today are complying with the new standards to keep our elderly safe. The president also met today with airline executives and I’ll reiterate as the president said, our profound gratitude to our partners in the airline industry. They have worked with us, as we say, flowing Americans through particular airports. The screening, we’re working very closely with the airlines on contact information. If a person is tested as positive for the coronavirus. We’re working with the airlines to get all the information, not just about that person but about who they sat next to and who else was on the flight. And the president and I are very grateful."
2020-03-05,06:02,Mike Pence,"As we announced yesterday. I’m pleased to report that as of yesterday morning in addition to the travel ban from China, we’ve suspended all travel coming in from China. We’ve suspended all travel coming in from Iran and even foreign nationals who visit either one of those countries are barred from coming into this country for 14 days. We also established a travel advisory for Italy, portions of Italy and portions of South Korea over the weekend. But even as importantly, as of yesterday morning, we fully implemented a screening process. All direct flights from all airports in South Korea and Italy are now being subject to multiple screens before passengers board to come to the United States of America. State Department worked very vigorously to bring that about and we’re grateful for the cooperation of the governments of Italy, the governments of South Korea as well as our airline partners in making that a reality."
2020-03-05,07:08,Mike Pence,"Finally, with regard to testing, we had a meeting today that gave us great hope for great progress in the near future on expanding testing across the country. We have a ways to go yet, but I’m pleased to report as we’ve been able to convey to state governments. Governors around the country, is that the thanks to the good work of the FDA and Dr. Steve Hahn, who’s with me here today. Now all state laboratories, all university laboratories at the state level can conduct coronavirus tests without any additional assets or resources from the federal government. They have the FDA approved tests. They can conduct the test all across the country in all the states."
2020-03-05,07:56,Mike Pence,"Beyond that as we announced through the efforts of HHS, 2,500 kits of tests are going out this week, 2,500 kits including tests has gone out this week. That’s roughly 1.5 million. A test that will be available this week will continue to build on that number but perhaps most significantly thanks to Dr. Birx efforts and leadership. We brought together today at the White House the leaders of all of the largest commercial laboratories in this country. Companies like Quest that have vast capabilities, logistics and testing capabilities and we were pleased to report today that they have created a consortium to share information and to share resources. And literally have told us that as they go through what is called the validation process on testing. That by next week individual companies will be able to do as they said to me, thousands of tests of coronavirus if they are needed and required and many, many multiples more of that in the not distant future."
2020-03-05,09:08,Mike Pence,"Our objective here as Dr. Birx raised with the task force is we’ve got hospitals in effected areas and those that are requesting that have kits. We’ve got universities and state labs that now can perform the test on a requested basis, but our objective ultimately and quickly as possible is to have tests made through these commercial laboratories and commercial providers that your local doctor, your CVS, your MedCheck is able to have a coronavirus test and that isn’t there yet. We’re working to make that a reality, but again, it’s one more example. It’s not just a whole of government approach. It’s a whole of America approach. Whether it be our nursing home industry, whether it be our airline industry, whether it be our commercial laboratories."
2020-03-05,09:57,Mike Pence,"I can speak on behalf of President Trump and our entire task force. When I say we are profoundly grateful for the spirit that’s being reflected by companies all across the United States of America. Grateful for the leadership at the state level and the American people should be confident that that spirit of partnership is going to continue to drive this at every level as we work our way through. Dealing with the coronavirus in the United States. With that, I’m going to recognize Dr. Deborah Birx for her comments."
2020-03-05,10:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Good evening. Over the last 12 hours, we’ve been able to receive information both from South Korea and Italy adding to our China information. And it’s as we thought, the elderly and preexisting conditions have a more serious illness when confronted with the coronavirus. Reassuringly in South Korea, no one has died under 30. This is reassuring to us and the immediate age in Italy was 81."
2020-03-05,11:02,Dr. Deborah Birx,"…and Italy was 81 of those who succumbed. Those who became ill, the median age was 60. So we find this data reassuring, but it also has really caused us to focus on the Americans who might be most vulnerable. We’re focusing resources, attention, and all of our capacity to ensure those who have pre-existing conditions and those who are elderly have access to the best prevention and treatment options. The prevention options flow right through all of us to ensure that we have good protective hygiene for our elderly clients around the globe. Thank you."
2020-03-05,11:42,Mike Pence,Thank you. Sema.
2020-03-05,11:46,Sema,"Thank you. And as you heard, because of the risk for our nation’s seniors, we are doubling down on our efforts. Today, we put out three memos. One was to hospitals about triaging and placement for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus. We also put out some information to nursing homes about limiting visitors to nursing homes, monitoring staff. And then finally, we put out some information to our state surveyors that are going to be surveying our nations nursing homes and hospitals around infection control. All of that information went out this morning."
2020-03-05,12:22,Mike Pence,"Very good. Thank you, Sema. CDC, Bob Redfield."
2020-03-05,12:25,Bob Redfield,"Thank you Mr. Vice President. I think what I’d like to highlight today is that first to echo what the Vice President started with when he was giving the American people the advice that he did as he went through, that we do have listed out on our CDC website, cdc.gov. It really is very important. It’s very pragmatic about washing your hands. 20 seconds of soap and water or using the other disinfectants. Obviously, training yourself to cover your sneeze or cough, either in your elbow or with a Kleenex that you will dispose of. These are very important things, working hard not to touch your face. I think the most important thing for many of those individuals that might be a little type A, if you gets sick, stay home. You’re not helping your colleagues by going to work sick."
2020-03-05,13:28,Bob Redfield,"And again, I think these are just very pragmatic. We’ve listed them. They’re absolutely no different than what we ask the American public do for flu. The second thing I would like to do is continue to get the help from you, to get those messages out. The one that’s the most important that the Vice President also talked about is the role of masks. We need these N95 masks for the healthcare workers that are taking care of these patients. We do not recommend them to be used by the general public. And again, you all of you tell the stories are able to be great communicators of that so that the American public gets accurate information and gets good guidance from your experts that you’ll reach out to for your stories. That’s what I would ask you to do and I’ll reiterate what the Vice President said at the beginning, that although we’re continuing to see new community cases in this nation, the overall risk to the American public at this time still remains low. Thank you."
2020-03-05,14:33,Mike Pence,Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:14:31].
2020-03-05,14:33,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Just to reiterate what was said by several of our colleagues here is that we make policy recommendations and analysis of what we’re going to recommend based on accumulation of data. Data is very important. What Dr. Birx just told you is data that underscores some of the things that we’ve been telling you. When you talk about risk, risk is something that’s vague to people and we’ve said many times if you talk about risk of infection throughout the country, it’s a low risk. If you talk about someone who is infected and we do have infected people in this country, you’ve heard that from Dr. Redfield. You understand the situation that we have in Seattle."
2020-03-05,15:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"If you do get infected, if you’re infected as taking Seattle as the microcosm of that, it is exactly what Dr. Birx said. The risk of getting into difficulties is very heavily weighted towards people with underlying conditions and people with the elderly. Where the young people, and they will be an exception here or there the same way we see with influenza, but the risk for a young person who gets infected to getting into trouble is really low, based on a lot of data that’s coming out of foreign countries, particularly out of China."
2020-03-05,15:44,Mike Pence,"Great. Thank you, Dr. [inaudible 00:04:45]. Dr. Carson."
2020-03-05,15:48,Dr. Carson,"I want to thank the Vice President and the President for a very aggressive and careful leadership. Now, I was involved throughout my neurosurgical career with a lot of very, very complex cases and dealt with a lot of renowned physicians, but I must say the people on this task force are extremely impressive. Have been considering all the various different possibilities, outlining scenarios for all the possibilities that can occur. It’s very comforting and recognize that the risk to a healthy adult still remains quite low, largely because of the aggressive actions that have been taken and are continuing to be taken every day. And just one last point, and that is the pharmaceuticals who normally are arrivals have worked together, voluntarily. Wouldn’t that be a great lesson for the politicians?"
2020-03-05,16:51,Mike Pence,"Great. A quick informational announcement. I’ll be traveling with many members of the task force to Minnesota tomorrow. We’ll be visiting 3M, which is poised to literally begin manufacturing millions more masks for our healthcare workers. And then we’ll be traveling on to Washington state. Will be meeting with Governor Inslee and with his health team to ensure that the full resources of the federal government are being brought to bear in support of their efforts to protect the health of the people across the Seattle area. With that, let me start right here."
2020-03-05,17:28,Unnamed,"Thank you, Vice President Pence. I have two questions. One about Washington and then one about Florida. I’ll start with Washington. Can you tell us a little bit more about how that meeting came to be? Will Secretary Azar be with you? Is that a meeting that the Governor asked you to come there? Can you explain?"
2020-03-05,17:47,Mike Pence,"I’ve spoken to Governor Inslee, who I know well from our time in Congress together several times since being tapped to lead the White House effort on the coronavirus a week ago. He’s been providing strong leadership for the state of Washington. They have an outstanding health department. But after meeting with members of the Senate and the House, particularly those from the Washington state delegation, we thought it would be important to bring our team out to meet with their team on the ground and to make sure that they have the full support. Our hearts go out to those that have been infected with the disease in the Seattle area, but also we understand the anxiety this has created in the full community and we’re going to be going out just to make sure in sitting down with the governor and with his team that they have everything they need and all the support they need to see to the health of their people."
2020-03-05,18:48,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. You will have a meeting on Saturday, is that correct? With the cruise liners, which companies are coming to that meeting? What’s the goal of that meeting? Is there something that you’d like to see them do differently that they’re not doing now?"
2020-03-05,19:01,Mike Pence,"Well, we’ll talk about just that. Obviously with the Diamond Princess issue, there are unique challenges that our experts tell us in a closed environment of a cruise liner. We’re going to talk about best practices and I thought it was timely to spend some time with people in that industry as we’re meeting with others in industries around the country. Okay. Back there, please. Sure."
2020-03-05,19:30,Unnamed,"Two quick questions. The first one I’ve been looking online at hand sanitizer, at soap, there’s some sites like Amazon where these prices have just skyrocketed. What’s your advice to Americans who are trying to just buy that soap and water and the hand sanitizer that you’re telling them to buy but can’t afford it at this point or can’t find it?"
2020-03-05,19:49,Mike Pence,That’s great. I want to ask the CDC to respond to that because they’ve got some very clear guidance.
2020-03-05,19:54,Bob Redfield,"Thank you Mr. Vice President. I want to make it really clear that I don’t think … Soap and water vigorously washing your hands for 20 seconds is what the American public needs to do. If they want to use the hand sanitizers, that’s another option. But I don’t want people to think it’s inferior to what we’ve recommended for decades, which is vigorous washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds."
2020-03-05,20:20,Mike Pence,"Okay, another one. Go ahead."
2020-03-05,20:23,Unnamed,You were talking about working on getting testing so that doctors at other places will be able to have it. How far along are you in that goal and what should Americans expect? How soon should Americans expect to be able to go to their doctor’s office to get tested?
2020-03-05,20:37,Mike Pence,"Well, I’m going to ask to Deborah Birx to address that, but just so you know, there’s three levels here. Number one is that we do have about 1.5 million test kits going out as we speak to hospitals, particularly hospitals in areas that have seen coronavirus cases. In addition to that, thanks to the good work of the FDA and the change that President Trump authorized this weekend, now every state health lab and university lab can conduct a coronavirus test. And that expands the capacity. But ultimately as Dr. Birx will explain, our objective is in addition to those tests being available, we want to get to a place where any American who has a concern, is able to go to their doctor, is able to go to a medical clinic and know that there’s a coronavirus available. We think we can get there in a matter of weeks and in partnership with the commercial labs, we’re challenging them to do just that. Dr. Birx."
2020-03-05,21:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Just briefly, because I think you were interested also in cost and I think what we’ve heard from CMS and from HHS that this will be an essential lab test, so fully reimbursable. What we talked about with the commercial laboratories is exactly your question."
2020-03-05,22:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"What we talked about with the commercial laboratories is exactly your question and we asked them, and they’re in validation this week. Some of them thought they would have tests available on Friday and the rest on Monday. I’ve asked them to prioritize the areas where we’ve had these clusters so that people can be reassured in those areas where there is… where we have identified virus has been circulating. In those cases, they will have it available at doctor’s office and all of our pediatric offices that would need it and they will transport it through a logistics network to make sure that they can be run."
2020-03-05,22:37,Unnamed,Follow up question-
2020-03-05,22:40,Mike Pence,"With regard to the costs, let me be very clear, HHS has designated the coronavirus tests as an essential health benefit. That means by definition it’s covered in the private health insurance of every American, as well as covered by Medicare and Medicaid. But we’re working with members of Congress and we’ll be monitoring the cost very carefully."
2020-03-05,23:05,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:23:05] travel restrictions on Italy and South Korea. Are you considering more, imposing more restrictions on travel?"
2020-03-05,23:12,Mike Pence,"Well, I’m going to ask Dr. Fauci to speak to that. At this time, they’re not recommending that the president impose additional travel advisories or restrictions, but as Dr. Fauci can explain where we’re going to follow the data on that very closely and follow the cases. If you want to speak to that."
2020-03-05,23:34,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So this is something that’s really evaluated in real time. I mean, you can’t make a decision now that you’re going to project what’s going to be. You just based on the data and it became very clear that the situation in Northern Italy and in Korea was actually unique compared to what we were seeing in several of the other countries. That’s why that was done. We reevaluate this literally every single day."
2020-03-05,23:57,Mike Pence,We do. We do. Right there.
2020-03-05,24:00,Unnamed,"Thank you, Vice President."
2020-03-05,24:01,Mike Pence,"No, right here."
2020-03-05,24:02,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-03-05,24:02,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-03-05,24:02,Mike Pence,"No, right here."
2020-03-05,24:02,Unnamed,Me?
2020-03-05,24:02,Mike Pence,Please.
2020-03-05,24:02,Unnamed,Thank you. So I was wondering what sort of progress was made with your meeting with the airline CEOs today about coordinating the collection of passenger data? And then also there’s been reports that the CDC is investigating a potential cluster of cases from a cruise ship in California that could be linked to the state’s first death. Could you confirm that and how many people might the CDC be investigating in that case?
2020-03-05,24:30,Mike Pence,"I’ll let CDC respond to your second question, but on the first question, I know the president was also very moved by the level of commitment from our airlines for customers’ health and safety as well as their crew’s health and safety. They described to us their activities in cleaning the aircraft and sanitizing aircraft. And we believe, as President Trump said today, that it’s safe to fly. It’s safe to fly in America and it’s safe to fly internationally, apart from the travel advisories that are available to the public."
2020-03-05,25:08,Mike Pence,"With that being said, it’s a work in progress about having contact information, but we were assured today by the airlines that they’ll continue to work very closely with us to provide manifests passengers on an individual flight in the event of a coronavirus infection and the cooperation has been just what the American people would expect from our airlines. But let me let CDC speak to the other issue."
2020-03-05,25:38,Bob Redfield,"Thank you Mr. Vice President. We are working in support of the California Health Department, that’s in the process of evaluating another cruise ship where they do have confirmed cases. We’re at the very beginning of that looking at the manifest to make sure we understand who’s gotten off the cruise and where they got off the cruise and we’re really involved in that entire contact followup as we speak right now."
2020-03-05,26:09,Unnamed,Last question guys.
2020-03-05,26:09,Unnamed,Mr. President. Mr. President.
2020-03-05,26:09,Mike Pence,Right here.
2020-03-05,26:09,Unnamed,Thank you very much. Possibly a question for Dr. Birx regarding it’s being safe to fly-
2020-03-05,26:14,Mike Pence,Please.
2020-03-05,26:15,Unnamed,"… you have spring break coming along, a lot of grandparents may be coming to visit family members to help watch over kids, older adults. Is it safe? If it’s unnecessary travel, should they still hop on a plane and travel?"
2020-03-05,26:30,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, that’s what we were talking about, the common sense approach. So if you have preexisting medical conditions or you’re of the elderly and frail, that is something that they need to take into context and that’s why we were very clear about providing that information, because we really want everyone to know what we know, that we’ve received this new data, we’ve gone through it carefully. It does look like there is significant, greater risk of serious illness as you become older and if you have other medical conditions. Now what I talked about also was protecting the elderly and protecting those with other medical conditions, and I want to be clear, the other medical conditions included people recovering from cancer, so just as you would protect them when they have their chemotherapy and their immuno responses are lower, you would do that with careful hand-washing again and ensuring if you have children in the household that they are following those same procedures. I have a nine month old and a two year old grandchild and they’re… the two year old has learned to wash your hands carefully and I think these are just things we need to ensure are happening every day in households."
2020-03-05,27:39,Unnamed,Mr. Vice President.
2020-03-05,27:43,Unnamed,"Do you have any hesitations traveling to Washington state tomorrow, I mean for your own personal health, and are you trying to send a message to all Americans that you believe it is safe to fly?"
2020-03-05,27:53,Mike Pence,"No, I have no hesitation at all. I have to tell you that the job that Washington state has done in confronting the coronavirus infections in the Seattle area has really been inspiring. You’ve got an outstanding health facility, outstanding health department and we’re going to be sitting down with all of their health officials. But I’m a real believer just as the president is, in sitting down, sitting nose to nose, as the president did today with executives, and asking the questions and making sure that the American people expect nothing less. They expect us to be there for that community and we’ll be bringing our task force out to make sure that Washington state has all the support that they need and that’s the purpose of the trip."
2020-03-05,28:40,Unnamed,"Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I appreciate it. In light of what Dr. Redfield said yesterday about how quickly this virus has been spreading, what will need to happen specifically for you to declare this a national emergency? What’s the threshold? Will it be the number of deaths? Will be the number of cases?"
2020-03-05,29:01,Mike Pence,"Well, let me let Dr. Fauci speak to that in terms of a determination and when a recommendation to the president. We’ve declared a public health emergency, but maybe you might speak to what area we-"
2020-03-05,29:11,Dr. Anthony Fauci,A public health.
2020-03-05,29:13,Unnamed,You know what I’m asking with regard to national emergency.
2020-03-05,29:16,Dr. Anthony Fauci,What precisely do you mean?
2020-03-05,29:18,Unnamed,"Well to declare a national emergency, what’s the threshold, the number of cases, the number of deaths, where you’re going to take decision making out of the hands of the states and you’re going to make, okay we’re going to quarantine the city or we are going to shut down big events or we are going to say no travel?"
2020-03-05,29:39,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Well let me just tell you-
2020-03-05,29:39,Unnamed,Major decisions.
2020-03-05,29:40,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"… how that would be made. That would be made by very serious discussions among the task force. I would think that if we were in a situation, and hopefully we never even approach that, we will you have clear, wide, diffuse community spread throughout the country and you have to have federal mandates that come in to essentially enforce certain types of social distancing. I think it would have to come to that. But I’m a bit humble about that. I would like to discuss it with a variety of other people who have more of a handle on the implications of that."
2020-03-05,30:16,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:30:20].
2020-03-05,30:16,Mike Pence,That would be a very good place-
2020-03-05,30:22,Unnamed,"Sorry, I’m sorry, sir."
2020-03-05,30:22,Mike Pence,"That’s a very good place to step off. We’re going to go back to work. But let me end where I began, and that is to say today in the United States, the combination of domestic cases and people that we have brought home, from China and from the Diamond Princess, we have slightly more than 100 cases. And the vast majority of those people either have recovered or are continuing to recover. Now that’s not going to lessen the focus of President Trump has charged us to continue to put on this issue. Continue to work closely with members of Congress to make sure that we have the resource to confront the spread of the coronavirus."
2020-03-05,31:07,Mike Pence,"But at this moment I have to tell you our state and local governments around the country are just doing an exceptional job. And as a former governor I can tell you that the people that are on the ground, the health care workers, the health officials at the state level are responding to this with compassion, with professionalism. And a big part of our job right now is just to make sure that they have the support that we come alongside them, that they have the personal protective equipment and gear to be able to minister to anyone who has the virus."
2020-03-05,31:44,Mike Pence,"But I think the American people can take some comfort that the reality is today, that the risk of the coronavirus to the average American remains low. And as we continue to take these steps, as Americans continue to take common sense practices to protect their own health, the health of their family, we’ll work to keep it there."
2020-03-05,32:09,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:32:09] Can the uninsured get tested? Gentlemen, ladies, can the uninsured get tested?"
2020-03-05,32:21,Unnamed,Screaming to the cameras ain’t going to get you anywhere.
2020-03-05,32:23,Unnamed,"Well, how about answering the question?"
2020-03-05,32:24,Unnamed,We would like an answer to that question.
2020-03-05,32:25,Unnamed,That’s a valid question. Could you answer it?
2020-03-05,32:28,Unnamed,What was your going to follow up going to be to me… with regard.
2020-03-06,00:00,Mike Pence,"Coronavirus remains low. That being said, we’re continuing to lean into this effort in full partnership with state and local health authorities around the country to ensure that we do everything to prevent the spread of the disease, to mitigate its expansion and to provide necessary treatment to Americans that have been impacted."
2020-03-06,00:27,Mike Pence,"But first, let me turn my attention, before we speak about some of our broader efforts and hear from some members of the task force, to an issue that I know is on the hearts and minds of people across the country. The Grand Princess cruise ship has been moored off the coast of California since Wednesday night. I want to commend the efforts of our coast guard that heroically flew coronavirus tests to the ship and we received those results. Working in close consultation with Governor Gavin Newsom and the state of California, we have developed a process for addressing our findings and resolving the circumstances facing Americans and people from around the world and the crew on the Grand Princess."
2020-03-06,01:17,Mike Pence,"First, the results. Among those tested, 46 persons were swabbed, 21 of those on the ship tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 tested negative, one test was inconclusive. Again, let me say 21 individuals on the Grand Princess tested positive. Among those were 19 crew members and two passengers. It’s important to note-"
2020-03-06,01:56,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:01:56] the positives?
2020-03-06,01:57,Mike Pence,"Yes. Among those positive for coronavirus were 19 crew members and two passengers. It’s important to note that the Grand Princess actually was on its second tour and we know of coronavirus infections from the first tour as well with very, very difficult results. In the wake of these findings today, we’ve been working through the day with Governor Newsom and his administration through their unified command efforts in California, CDC and HHS, and we have developed a plan which will be implemented this weekend to bring the ship into a non-commercial port. All passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus. Those that need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those that require additional medical attention, will receive it."
2020-03-06,03:00,Mike Pence,"But let me assure the American public, as we did so with Americans returning from China and those returning from the other cruise ship, we are taking all measures necessary to see to the health of the Americans and those involved on the Grand Princess and just as importantly to protect the health of the American public and prevent the spread of the disease through communities in this country. We are instituting the strongest testing protocols to ensure that not only those on board receive the treatment that they need, but that the American people can be confident that there will be no erosion in our preventative measures in efforts to keep the coronavirus from spreading throughout our country."
2020-03-06,03:55,Mike Pence,"I want to express our gratitude to Governor Newsom and the state of California for their full partnership, not just in dealing with the Grand Princess, but throughout the advent of the coronavirus. California has been a strong partner and as I just told the governor a few moments ago, we will continue to work very closely with his administration and we will continue to put the health and safety of America first."
2020-03-06,04:25,Mike Pence,"With that, let me turn my attention to the issue of testing, which has been much in the news of late and the president spoke about it just a few moments ago at the CDC. It’s very important to note that because of President Trump’s decisive leadership, that the risk to the American public of contracting the coronavirus does remain low. But nevertheless, in Washington State where I visited yesterday with members of our team and in California, we have seen, as Dr. Fauci often describes, a community transmission still less than 200 cases across the country. And the good news is most Americans who’ve contracted this disease are being treated and recovering and on the road to recovery."
2020-03-06,05:13,Mike Pence,"Sadly, we all know of the loss of life and we grieve that along with their families, but the American people deserve to know that we are ready. And that because of the president’s leadership and because of extraordinary efforts by CDC and Health and Human Services and our partners in state labs around the country, we have the testing necessary to be able to provide tests to all the states that have requested it. As I said yesterday, we’ve been able to provide tests to all the state jurisdictions and labs that have requested it and I’m pleased to report that all state labs have the test. And now because of the change that president Trump implemented at the FDA a week ago, now state labs can actually conduct coronavirus tests themselves."
2020-03-06,06:06,Mike Pence,"Beyond that, between March 2nd and 5th, we distributed more than 900000 tests across the country, including 200000 that could allow 75 individual patients, 75000 individual patients to be tested. As the secretary of HHS just described, by tomorrow another 200000 tests will be shipped, and by the weekend another million tests will be shipped around the country, with the expectation that at the end of next week, four million tests will be shipped."
2020-03-06,06:37,Mike Pence,"We’ve been able to respond to the request of states that have been impacted by the coronavirus, but as I said yesterday, to meet future demand, this week the president brought together the leading commercial labs in America and asked them to in effect partner with the United States in developing tests for the American people. And I’m proud to say that just in the last 24 hours, LabCorp and Quest, two of America’s leading commercial laboratories, have announced the test will be available by Monday of this week. The reason that’s important and the reason that meets future demand is because the enormous capacity of these commercial laboratories and others in the country are precisely how we will make coronavirus tests available for your local doctor, available to your pharmacy and broadly available to the American public."
2020-03-06,07:35,Mike Pence,"Tomorrow, Dr. Steve Hahn and the FDA will come to this room and brief, in specific, our efforts with regard to testing to assure the American public that every effort is being made to provide testing resources, not just for state laboratories, not just for universities, not just for hospitals in affected areas, but with the announcement of these major commercial labs, we trust in a matter of weeks, the coronavirus tests will be broadly available to the public and available to any American that is symptomatic and has a concern about the possibility of having contracted the coronavirus."
2020-03-06,08:16,Mike Pence,"We’ve made great progress but there is much work to be done. Over the course of this weekend, I’ll be traveling to Florida to meet with cruise line executives. We’ll be discussing with them in particular what additional measures our cruise lines could take to ensure the health and safety of the American public and I look forward to those conversations tomorrow. I want to introduce Dr. Fauci for comment and then I’ll also introduce the the Admiral and Bob [Celtic 00:08:46] about our plans with regard to the cruise ship."
2020-03-06,08:51,Mike Pence,"But let me make a, maybe make one last comment if I may before we hear from other members of the task force. I’ve said it twice, let me say it again. The general risk to the American public remains low, but if you are an individual with a serious underlying health condition or and are elderly, it’s important to take precautions and use common sense, particularly as it relates to travel. We want to recognize, from the experience now of two cruise ships, that cruise ships represent a unique challenge for health officials, and so we would ask elderly Americans to use common sense and caution in planning any cruise ship vacation in the future. But they can be assured we’re going to be working closely with some great American companies in the cruise line industry to enhance and strengthen the screening procedures that take place as passengers board and as they disembark."
2020-03-06,09:59,Mike Pence,"With that, let me yield it for a few moments to Dr. Fauci and then we’ll hear from other members of the task force about the Grand Princess as well as testing. Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-06,10:16,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much Mr. Vice President. I just want to take the opportunity very briefly. Last time I was here at the podium, we were talking about what the vice president said about the risk of getting infected and how we need to distinguish that from if you are infected like the unfortunate situation that we’ve seen in Seattle and what we’re seeing on cruise ships. Is that in that group of people who get infected, the ones who are clearly the most vulnerable to getting the complications of serious disease and even death are people with underlying conditions, particularly among the elderly with underlying conditions and those are heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes, et cetera. So what I’d like to do today is publicly answer a question that I get asked all the time now, is that if you are a person with an underlying condition, the conditions that I just mentioned, particularly if you’re an elderly person with that, as the vice president said, beyond even cruise ships, to just use the common sense of trying to protect yourself because you’re the most vulnerable. That is often referred to as social distancing. And what we mean by that is if you’re a person who is in that category, think twice, even before you get on a plane for a long trip, or you want to travel, or you want to go to a place that’s crowded, where there maybe people who are in fact have an infection of any sort, that doesn’t necessarily have to be even coronavirus. It could be influenza or anything like that."
2020-03-06,11:52,Dr. Anthony Fauci,So I want to publicly answer the question that I keep getting asked in a private situation. If you’re in that category or if you’re the family of individuals in that-
2020-03-06,12:03,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"… in that category, or if you’re the family of individuals in that category, take care to try and take care of the most vulnerable among them. And there are simple things that you can do, practical, common sense about not putting yourself in a situation, whatever that might be, that might increase the risk given your situation. Thank you."
2020-03-06,12:22,Mike Pence,"Thank you Dr. Fauci. Well said. With that, I’d like to introduce Vice Admiral Abel, who, again, the Coast Guard did heroic work transporting tests to the Grand Princess and is going to play a key role as we implement the process of resolving the impasse on the ship."
2020-03-06,12:46,Vice Admiral Abel,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
2020-03-06,12:46,Mike Pence,Admiral.
2020-03-06,12:48,Vice Admiral Abel,"First of all, we’d like to send our appreciation out to the members of the 129th Air Rescue Recovery Wing, California Air National Guard, that played a key role last night in getting the test kits out to the ship, retrieving those test kits. It’s great to have ship mates like that, that stand by our side when the nation needs it. Coast Guard looks forward to operationalizing the best risk mitigation plan that’s developed on medical science from the state, local and federal level. And we use our Captain of the Port Authorities to direct a ship to execute that plan. Thank you."
2020-03-06,13:21,Mike Pence,Thank you. And Bob Kadlick Is the assistant secretary who’s been coordinating the preparedness and the response to the Grand Princess.
2020-03-06,13:30,Bob Kadlick,"Thank you very much Mr. Vice President and good evening everyone. I wanted to say, first of all, thanks to Governor Newsom and his staff at the state health office and emergency management in California, they’ve been extraordinary great partners, not only during this event as we’re developing a concept of operations and planning to, if you will, disembark passengers from that ship safely and effectively, ensuring that their safety as well as the community that they will be coming into will be protected. But I want to say that they’ve been great partners throughout this. They’ve been critical in our repatriation efforts from Wuhan as well as from the Diamond Princess ship in Japan."
2020-03-06,14:12,Bob Kadlick,"And again, the details are becoming more apparent, and we’ll brief you as those become more firm, but I want to say this is a whole government of effort. We’re working with Department of Defense with the Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security, our colleagues at CDC, as well as the state and local authorities in California, to ensure that we can bring those people home safely and as quickly as possible. Thank you."
2020-03-06,14:36,Mike Pence,"Great. Dr Birch, did you want to speak to our plan with regard to that?"
2020-03-06,14:41,Dr. Birch,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. So this will be a comprehensive plan that, like our other Diamond Princess, was a comprehensive approach to ensure the health and welfare of all of our citizens. As Dr. Fauci discussed, we know many of the people on the cruise ship are in their 60s, 70s and 80s, and we want to make sure, as we know, that that’s a more vulnerable group, that we pay special attention to anybody who has any comorbidities or other conditions. And so we’re working very hard with the people on the ship and the medical team there. To make sure that their health and welfare is prioritized. Thank you."
2020-03-06,15:19,Mike Pence,"Good. And Dr. Stephen Hahn, with the FDA for the latest on the availability of testing."
2020-03-06,15:26,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. As a reminder about this test, this is a swab test, not a point of care test. We discussed that yesterday, but that’s the component of this test. It is a test that’s been developed by the CDC, based upon their first obtaining the genetic sequence of the virus. That test is very high quality. We have high confidence in that test. That test is now available in all public health labs as described by the vice president."
2020-03-06,15:58,Dr. Steven Hahn,"In response to the demand that we’re seeing for the test, we are increasing the supply of this test as described by the vice president and we believe that that will be available significantly across the country and I can provide more details tomorrow, for specific numbers, if you will. As of yesterday, the CDC test was shipped out 900,000 tests. We have another 200,000 which we expect to be shipped out tomorrow and have gone through the quality assurance process. Another 1 million tests will be quality assessed this weekend and we expect those to go out early next week. We expect further surge in test capacity beyond that, by the end of next week. And again, I’m really happy to provide details."
2020-03-06,16:45,Unnamed,How many have been tested so far? Can you say that?
2020-03-06,16:47,Dr. Steven Hahn,I think that’s a question that should probably be addressed to the CDC for the most accurate number. Thank you.
2020-03-06,16:52,Mike Pence,And state labs. Questions. Please.
2020-03-06,16:58,Unnamed,"Where do you expect these people to be quarantined and of 19 crew members, two passengers, why so many crew were infected?"
2020-03-06,17:06,Mike Pence,"Well, we’re going to get to the bottom of it, but it’s very likely that the crew on the Grand Princess was exposed on two different outings and we know the coronavirus manifested among the previous passengers. So we’ll find that out but we will be testing everyone on the ship. We will be quarantining as necessary. But with regard to the 1100 member crew, we anticipate that they will be quarantined on the ship, will not need to disembark. But let me refer to Secretary Kadlick to respond. We’re working, literally, hour by hour with the Department of Defense and with the State of California to identify the military bases where we’ll do the testing of the remaining passengers."
2020-03-06,18:06,Bob Kadlick,"Yes sir. Thank you. And it is truly evolving right now. Obviously, there’ve been bases that have been identified before, Travis, Lackland, and we’re working with the Department of Defense to identify the appropriate settings. Again, realizing that we’re trying to ensure both the safety of the passengers and the safety of the communities that around them. So happy to answer any more questions. Thank you."
2020-03-06,18:27,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, APAC in the last little while, send out a notification to people who attended the conference to say, two people from New York who attended the conference have tested positive for coronavirus. Are you concerned that the virus is now here in Washington DC and there’s a lot of members of Congress attend APAC? Are you concerned that some members of Congress may have contracted the virus?"
2020-03-06,18:49,Mike Pence,"Well, let me say that’s the first I’ve heard of it, in the midst of a busy day. We will be engaged and I am confident in the same contact tracing that we are for any case, but maybe Dr. Fauci could speak to a concern about the nation’s capital that you raised."
2020-03-06,19:10,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah. Again, when you have lack of information, it’s tough to make anything definitive but obviously if you have someone who is here, the risk of there being a major outbreak, obviously, is which everybody thinks about, but what will happen is that those individuals that were infected will have contact tracing. And that’s the public health weapon, if you want to call it that, we have. Namely, to get those people isolated and to do the contact tracing. We don’t have enough information now because this is the first that I’ve actually heard about it, also, with a busy day. So as soon as we get further information, we’ll be happy to share that with you."
2020-03-06,19:48,Jim (Reporter),"Vice President, the president, just a short while ago said that anybody that needs a test can have a test. They’re all set. Can we drill down on that. When exactly, will a person who feels like they may have coronavirus, can they go into their doctor’s office and get a test? In addition to that, Mr. Vice President, just a short while ago, the president described Governor Inslee of Washington State, who you just met with yesterday, as a snake. He also described the coronavirus test, compared it to the phone call that he had with the leader of Ukraine. Is the president addressing the situation with the seriousness it requires?"
2020-03-06,20:27,Mike Pence,"well, I promise you President Trump has no higher priority, than the health and safety of the American people. And he’s assembled an extraordinary group of Americans and agencies. I’m a little more than a week into leading the White House coronavirus effort, and I couldn’t be more proud and more impressed with the team that the president assembled. But I think your first question is a very important one, Jim, and I appreciate it."
2020-03-06,20:57,Mike Pence,"The president’s exactly right, that for the state laboratories, for the communities that have been impacted, that have concerns about the coronavirus, we have been able to respond to requests for tests. And literally you can hear that the test that’s been made available since the first of this month, literally amounts in the hundreds of thousands and millions of tests. But for the American public to have access to the coronavirus test, it’s the reason why President Trump brought in this week, all of the CEOs of the top commercial laboratories in the country."
2020-03-06,21:35,Mike Pence,"They’re the ones that we believed could spin up a new test very rapidly. They have enormous logistics and manufacturing capabilities and we said to them, “We want you to work together,” because while all state labs can now conduct their own test, and while, as I described and as Dr. Hahn described, we’ve distributed hundreds of thousands, in fact over a million tests around the country, to get it all across the American people, to your local doctor, to your pharmacy, to what, when my kids were little, we used to call the med check, It’s going to require these commercial labs. And the good news is, it didn’t get too widely reported, but both LabCorp and Quest, two of the largest commercial labs in the country, just announced that by Monday, they will have tests available for distribution and sale across the country."
2020-03-06,22:28,Jim (Reporter),"If I could followup with this, vice president, if somebody is feeling ill this weekend and they go to the doctor on Monday, can the doctor request a coronavirus test, any American in the country or are we not at that point? I want to make sure that it’s crystal clear in terms of what the expectations are."
2020-03-06,22:44,Mike Pence,"Well, I think for any American that is symptomatic, speaking to your doctor, if you have reason to believe that you have been exposed to the coronavirus, I have every confidence that your physician would contact state health officials and have access to the state lab. We’ve made those tests available to the state labs. I’ve spoke to Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina today. I spoke to Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia last night, and we’ve been working hard to make sure that where we have suspected cases, that we’ve been making tests available. But you make a very fair point about the wider availability to doctors and physicians and clinics, will happen, we believe, because of the collaboration that President Trump forged with our commercial labs. And the great news is, as they announced yesterday, by Monday, two of the largest commercial labs in America, announced they will have tests and begin to take them to market."
2020-03-06,23:44,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Two questions if I could. One on workers and one on families. The first one on workers, there are a lot of Americans who are worried about losing wages if they’re forced to stay home because they’re not on a regular salary. Is the White House preparing any economic mitigation effort for workers who suffer wage losses here? And the second one is on families…"
2020-03-06,24:03,Mike Pence,"… for workers who suffer wage losses here. And the second one is on families, which is you’re telling people to stay home if they feel sick."
2020-03-06,24:06,Unnamed,Right.
2020-03-06,24:07,Mike Pence,What’s your advice to parents of children who might have a lot of vulnerable people in their households? Should they be quarantining themselves with their children in the house or do they need to be quarantining themselves somewhere else away from their own families and children?
2020-03-06,24:22,Unnamed,"Well, with regard to your first question, I will tell you that I’ve been very inspired at the response of businesses around this country and their sensitivity and decision making about Americans who are potentially impacted by the coronavirus. But I will tell you in the days ahead, when I was on Capitol Hill this week meeting with Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate we talked about should this become much more widespread in the country, there were recommendations from Congress, which I know we would carefully consider. But let me… Your second question I think might be the most important one asked. And that is for families, what are the best practices at home, and I’d like to ask Dr. Burks to address that."
2020-03-06,25:16,Dr. Burks,"That’s an excellent question. I come from a multi generational household. I have nine-month-old, two-year-old grandchildren. My parents live in the same household. They’re 91 and 96 and my daughter and husband are there. And I think this is a very critical question and it’s why over the last week we’ve really been focused on who is the most vulnerable, who needs to be protected and ensuring that every family understands that. And I think your question is critical because it comes back to what Dr. Fauci said. If they follow good hand washing techniques, if they ensure that everything is washed that is used with the grandparents, if they ensure that the children if ill are kept away from the grandparents and somewhat separated in the household with strong cleaning and other hand washing and hand touching pieces, this is what social distancing can occur in the household. And that’s really the focus that we have, that every household has the capacity in order to ensure that this health and welfare of their elderly and others with medical conditions. And I want to make sure we’ve also emphasized that because anyone that has an immunodeficiency independent of age is someone else that we have to be very careful with in ensuring that we’re protecting them."
2020-03-06,26:36,Mike Pence,"Should they be sending those family members who are not infected to stay somewhere else? So if you’ve got a couple of kids, one who’s infected and the other ones are not, should you send the ones who are still healthy somewhere else or do you need to quarantine everybody in the family in the same house at the same time? Because that sounds a little scary."
2020-03-06,26:52,Dr. Burks,I’m looking at Dr. Fauci and I think that’s a great question and we’re going to talk about that and I don’t want to give you-
2020-03-06,27:00,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I don’t think there really is a decisive answer about that. It depends upon the feasibility of do you have some place to put the child? I think that if you’re in a situation where you really cannot do it, then you just sort of say, “Well, I’m going to keep them both together.” Realizing that with children, and this gets back to what I just said a little while ago, the risk of there being a problem of infection with the children is really very low. If you look at all of the reports from every place, from China, from Italy, from Korea, it’s the same."
2020-03-06,27:34,Mike Pence,Next question. Go ahead.
2020-03-06,27:39,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, to go on an earlier question, if today any American who wants a test cannot currently get a test, when is that target date? When do we expect any American who wants a test to same day be able to get it?"
2020-03-06,27:56,Mike Pence,"Let me ask Dr Hahn to respond to that. When we met with the major commercial labs, in addition to… I want to emphasize that again because of the changes that the FDA made, now all state labs can perform a coronavirus test. And I spoke to one governor about that today and we clarified that with him. We’ve distributed these kits, hundreds of thousands, over a million tests more to come. But to get the test widely distributed across the country I couldn’t be more grateful that our commercial labs have already announced, two of the leading commercial labs in America, that they’ll create a product. But let me let you talk to Dr. Hahn because the FDA is in the process of working with those companies and see if Dr. Hahn has a sense. But I remember that they told us, given their enormous production capability that in a matter of weeks, not months, that we could be seeing a coronavirus broadly distributed around the country and then growing literally by the day. Dr. Hahn. Is that about right?"
2020-03-06,29:06,Dr. Steven Hahn,"That’s correct. Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
2020-03-06,29:07,Unnamed,"And also if I might add to that, do you have some idea of how many test kits we are going to need total?"
2020-03-06,29:14,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So I’m going to use the term tests, not kits so that we can be clear about sort of the lexicon that we’re using. So as I mentioned, as of tomorrow we expect 1.1 million tests to have been shipped to laboratories and those would have gone to mostly nonpublic health laboratories. In answer to your question, because I’m thinking like a doctor here, if I were with a patient who came in I wanted to test, what I would recommend to that provider is to contact, as the vice president said, their local public health group because they’re going to be able to know about availability in that state. But as the vice president says with these large commercial labs having the ability to now scale up those tests, and this is a critical part of this, in addition to the millions of tests that we’ll be sending out this upcoming week as well as what we’ve already done, we expect that to surge substantially."
2020-03-06,30:07,Unnamed,How many do we need? Are we talking we need a test available potentially for every American? What is our target?
2020-03-06,30:15,Dr. Steven Hahn,So we’ll talk a little bit about this tomorrow. It’s a complicated answer to the question and I don’t want to mislead the American public. But one test doesn’t necessarily equal one patient. And so that equation I think is worth discussing in more detail.
2020-03-06,30:26,Audience,[crosstalk 00:30:30].
2020-03-06,30:33,Mike Pence,"Let me maybe follow on that with two things. Number one, the president’s directed a whole of government approach. We’re leaning into this effort and we’re going to work with our commercial partners. We’re going to work with the CDC and we’re going to meet that need for the American public and I’m confident of that, particularly as I see the way. Frankly see the way state governments, state health departments, public laboratories and our commercial laboratories have stepped up. Let me also say, as I said yesterday when we were in Washington State, one of the things the CDC has done is in the midst of these numbers that can get a little blurry at the time, we’ll make sure you have all of them in detail and Dr. Hahn will detail it tomorrow. We have prioritized areas of the country where we have community transmission and the recommendation of our experts is we’ve been focusing tests in California and in Washington State. I’ve had those conversations with both of those governors and we’ll continue to do that even as we work to build a wider availability."
2020-03-06,31:42,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. Vice President.
2020-03-06,31:44,Mike Pence,Sure.
2020-03-06,31:44,Unnamed,"You have encouraged caution and social distancing for elderly Americans and people who have preexisting conditions. I was looking at the government statistics, people who are over 65, that’s 50 million Americans, people who have preexisting conditions, that’s another 50 million to 100 million Americans. Are you essentially saying that a third of the country, maybe up to half of the country should have caution before traveling? And if that’s the case, should major events, major conferences, political rallies just be canceled at this point because they would include a large percentage of elderly Americans and people with preexisting conditions?"
2020-03-06,32:22,Mike Pence,"Well, let me try it again. A lot of facts and a lot of information, so let me be as clear as I can. What I want to say today is in consultation with these experts is that as we look at the data, initial data in this country and data coming in from around the world, that the elderly with serious underlying health conditions are the most vulnerable to the coronavirus. Let me say that again. That elderly individuals with underlying health conditions are the most vulnerable to serious results from the coronavirus. And so today we say with great respect that it is a good time for any American who is elderly by however they define it and has a serious underlying health condition to think carefully about travel. And I think Dr. Fauci was clear on that and I’d like him to have the last word."
2020-03-06,33:26,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So the numbers and the statistics you said are correct, but there’s really a difference between an underlying condition and a serious underlining condition that would actually compromise you. So let me explain. By the numbers that you said, someone who has high blood pressure, is on a blood pressure medication and has got it down pretty well has an underlying condition. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that might require interment oxygen is a serious underlying condition. There’s a big difference between somebody with controlled hypertension and somebody with congestive heart failure and chronic pulmonary disease. So although your numbers are correct, it isn’t really one third of the American population."
2020-03-06,34:10,Audience,[crosstalk 00:34:10].
2020-03-06,34:10,Mike Pence,Thanks everybody.
2020-03-06,34:12,Audience,[crosstalk 00:10:16].
2020-03-06,34:12,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, how many have been [inaudible 00:34:19] so far in this country? Dr. Fauci, how many have been [inaudible 00:34:20] so far in this country? Do you all have the number at CDC?"
2020-03-06,34:21,Dr. Anthony Fauci,CDC has the number.
2020-03-06,34:21,Unnamed,You don’t know the number?
2020-03-06,34:21,Dr. Anthony Fauci,I don’t want to give you a number and then [inaudible 00:10:27].
2020-03-06,34:28,Unnamed,Any number would be nice.
2020-03-09,03:01,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. We just attended a very important task force meeting on the virus that everybody is talking about all over the world. No matter where you go, that’s what’s on people’s minds. We are going to take care of and have been taking care of, the American public and the American economy. We are going to be asking tomorrow, we’re seeing the Senate. We’re going to be meeting with the House Republicans, Mitch McConnell, everybody. And discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, very substantial relief. That’s a big number."
2020-03-09,03:40,Donald Trump,"We’re also going to be talking about our early wage earners getting help, so that they can be in a position where they’re not going to ever miss a paycheck. We’re going to be working with companies and small companies, large companies, a lot of companies, so that they don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault. It’s not their fault, it’s not our country’s fault. This was something that we were thrown into. We’re going to handle it, and we have been handling it very well. The big decision was early, when we shut down our borders. We’re the first ones ever to do that. We’ve never done that in our country before, or we would have a situation that would be a lot more dire."
2020-03-09,04:23,Donald Trump,"Also, we’re going to be seeing the Small Business Administration, and creating loans for small businesses. We’re also working with the industries including the airline industry, the cruise ship industry, which obviously will be hit. We’re working with them very, very strongly. We want them to travel. We want people to travel to certain locations, and not to other locations at this moment. Hopefully, that will straighten out sooner rather than later. But we’re working with the industries and in particular, those two industries. We’re also talking to the hotel industry. Some places actually will do well, and some places probably won’t do well at all. But we’re working also with the hotel industry."
2020-03-09,05:06,Donald Trump,"But the main thing is that we’re taking care of the American public, and we will be taking care of the American public. I really appreciate the professionals behind me, and the professionals actually behind them in a different room. We have a tremendous team, and it’s headed up by our great Vice President, Mike Pence. I want to thank Mike, because he’s been working 24 hours a day, just about. He has been working very, very hard, very diligently and very professionally. I want to thank him. I want to thank the team. And I’ll have Mike say a few words. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please."
2020-03-09,05:44,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. We just completed today’s meeting of the White House coronavirus task force. We had the opportunity to brief the President today on a broad range of issues. Once again, because of the unprecedented action that President Trump took in January, suspending all travel from China, establishing travel advisories for portions of South Korea and Italy, establishing screening of all direct flights, all passengers from all airports, Italy and South Korea… we have bought a considerable amount of time, according to all the health experts, to deal with the coronavirus here in the United States."
2020-03-09,06:34,Mike Pence,"In fact, as I stand before you today, the risk of contracting the coronavirus to the American public remains low, and the risk of serious disease among the American public also remains low. That being said, the president did deploy not just a whole of government approach, but also a whole of America approach. And last week at the President’s direction, we met with leaders in industries from nursing homes to airlines, pharmaceutical companies, commercial labs, and it’s had great, great impact. Pharmaceutical companies are already working literally, around the clock on the development of therapeutics that will be medicines that can bring relief to people that contract the coronavirus."
2020-03-09,07:25,Mike Pence,"I know that how pleased the President was to learn that the commercial labs in this country led by companies like LabCorp and Quest, have already brought a test forward and are taking that to market, effective today. This week, att the President’s direction, we’ll be meeting with hospital CEOs, health insurance CEOs, and all building on top of what the President will be announcing tomorrow with regard to economic relief for working Americans."
2020-03-09,07:57,Mike Pence,"We also met today in a conference call with 47 of America’s governors. We were able to brief them on the latest, the progress that we’ve made. We were able to confirm with them that testing is now available in all state labs in every state in the country. Over a million tests have been distributed before the end of this week. Another four million tests will be distributed. But as I said before, with the deployment of the commercial labs, we literally are going to see a dramatic increase in the availability of testing. And that’s all a direct result of the President’s leadership."
2020-03-09,08:41,Mike Pence,"Today, in a few moments, we will outline community guidance that Dr. Berks and Dr. Fauci will be publishing. At the President’s direction, we are going to a providing guidance about how to keep your home safe, how to keep your business safe, how to keep safe and healthy at your school. We’ll be publishing that information and speaking about that."
2020-03-09,09:07,Mike Pence,"A brief word about the Grand Princess. The Grand Princess has docked this afternoon in Oakland, California, at a commercial dock. 25 children. We were happy to learn through the screening over the last two days, that 25 children on the ship are all healthy. Of the people that have contracted the coronavirus, 21 in all, they are being dealt with in proper isolation, working with health authorities in California. We hope before the end of today to begin to disembark California residents to Travis Air Force Base and Miramar. We’ve made arrangements with Canada and the U.K. to take their passengers back. They’ll be transported directly to the tarmac, charter flights home."
2020-03-09,10:05,Mike Pence,"Tomorrow, the remaining passengers will be transported again through very, very carefully controlled environments. Buses out to the tarmac, and flown to military bases in Georgia and Texas. All the passengers will be tested, isolated as appropriate, quarantined as appropriate. I want to express appreciation to the Governor of California and his administration, the Governor of Georgia, the Governor of Texas, for their strong cooperation with us in resolving the issues around the Grand Princess. It has been a partnership which the President directed us from the very beginning. And the process that Bob Kadlec will detail in any questions in a few moments, continues to work and move forward."
2020-03-09,10:57,Mike Pence,"The remaining people on the ship, the crew itself, will push off from the dock, and they will be quarantined and observed and treated shipboard. But the President made the priority to get the Americans ashore. We’re in the process of doing that, as well as returning the foreign nationals."
2020-03-09,11:20,Mike Pence,"Let me just say one other point, is the President has spoken today to congressional leadership. One of the things that I informed the President that I had been hearing from governors, is the concern about hourly wage earners in this country feeling that they had to go to work even if they were ill. And the President has tasked this economic team, and is working already with leaders in the Congress to make sure that anyone is not… feels that they are at risk of losing their job or losing a paycheck because they may contract the coronavirus. When we tell people if you’re sick, stay home."
2020-03-09,12:02,Mike Pence,"The President has tasked the team with developing economic policies that will make it very, very clear that we’re going to stand by those hardworking Americans, stand by those businesses, large and small, and make it possible for us, as the President said from the very beginning, put the health of America first. We’ll be available to take any questions on any of these topics. But Mr. President, I didn’t know if you wanted to speak a few more in closing."
2020-03-09,12:29,Donald Trump,"Well, I think what we will be doing is having a news conference tomorrow to talk about various things that we’re doing economically. They’ll be very major, including obviously, the payroll tax cut. So we’ll be meeting again tomorrow afternoon. We’ll be coming back from the Senate. We have a lot of very important meetings set up. We’ll have a press conference sometime after that, and we’ll explain what we’re doing on an economic standpoint and from an economic standpoint. But they will be very, very dramatic."
2020-03-09,13:01,Donald Trump,"We have a great economy. We have a very strong economy. But this came, this blindsided the world. I think we’ve handled it very, very well. I think they’ve done a great job. The people behind me have done a great job. So I will be here tomorrow afternoon to let you know about some of the economic steps we’re taking, which will be major. Thank you very much."
2020-03-09,13:22,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, have you been tested, sir? Mr. President, have you been tested?"
2020-03-09,13:25,Mike Pence,Thank you Mr. President.
2020-03-09,13:27,Unnamed (Reporter),Has he been tested? Has he been tested? Have you been tested?
2020-03-09,13:38,Mike Pence,I have not been tested for the coronavirus.
2020-03-09,13:42,Unnamed (Reporter),Has the President been tested? He’s been in contact with people who were in proximity to somebody who had the virus.
2020-03-09,13:48,Mike Pence,"Let me be sure and get you an answer to that. I honestly don’t know the answer to the question. But will refer that question, and we will get you an answer from the White House physician very quickly. Let me ask Dr. Fauci and Dr. Berks to come to the podium. You all in the American public will have at their fingertips very quickly, guidance. This is for every American. We’re working with communities like the Seattle area, like portions of California, New York and Florida, that have what we call community spread, a concentration of coronavirus cases. But we directed our team to come up with helpful recommendations for every American, every American family, every American business and school. If a Dr. Berks and Dr. Fauci step forward, they can outline that for you."
2020-03-09,14:43,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Great, thank you. Good evening. It was good getting out last week, meeting with communities. We know that the real solutions to this, is every American has a role in stopping the spread of the virus. So we wanted to really put out guidance for every American and every community that was practical and common sense, but detailed in a way that everyone would know precisely what to do. The guidance will be around how to keep workplaces safe, how to keep schools safe, how to keep the home safe, and how to keep commercial businesses safe, where people would eat or be present."
2020-03-09,15:20,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The importance about this is we believe that communities are at the center of this. I came from a field where it was the communities that really solved our issues around HIV prevention. So we’re very much speaking to the communities and the American people about what can be done. All of this information came from a paper that Dr. Fauci provided from the Australians. First author, Dalton. So you can actually look up the scientific evidence that informed each of these guidelines. But we will be providing that this evening in great detail so that every mother, father, child, son, daughter, caregiver, will know precisely what to do and what to ask for."
2020-03-09,16:02,Mike Pence,Dr. Fauci.
2020-03-09,16:03,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Yeah.
2020-03-09,16:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,… What to do and what to ask for.
2020-03-09,16:03,Mike Pence,Doctor [Fauci 00:00:16:03]?
2020-03-09,16:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah. Just to reiterate what Doctor Birx said, it was as simple as that. We have been speaking about the kinds of things that would keep our citizens safe in a variety of environments. We’ve been speaking about it on telephone calls. We’ve been speaking about it at conferences."
2020-03-09,16:21,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The CDC has been talking about this for a long time, as has Doctor Birx and I. So we thought we would put it together in a neat, formed way that would be available to the general public."
2020-03-09,16:32,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What Doctor Birx had mentioned, is that just the other day, I got one of many, many e-mails, where some of my colleagues that I know from Australia, actually decided they were going to write a paper on it, and make a number of boxes, which was exactly saying what we had been talking about. So we came up with the idea, it would be very good for clarity, so why don’t we just put it together, edit it a little and put it in a way that people could look."
2020-03-09,16:55,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What about the home? What about the school? What about the workplace? These are really simple low tech things. There’s nothing in there that’s complicated, but it’s just stated in a way that’s clear, that people can understand."
2020-03-09,17:08,Mike Pence,"I might ask the Surgeon General, so is there anything about the guidance you want to reflect on?"
2020-03-09,17:13,Jerome Adams,"Well, one thing I want folks to know is that we have been looking at the data from around the world, and we now know more than we ever have about who is at risk. Who is at risk, and I hope you will help us communicate this to the American people, are people over the age of 60. They’re much more likely to develop complications from the Coronavirus, and to be hospitalized from the Coronavirus. The average age of death is age 80."
2020-03-09,17:39,Jerome Adams,"Now, what we also want communities to know, is that if you are a child or young adult, you are much more, you’re more likely to die from the flu, if you get it, then you are to die from Coronavirus. So there is something about being young that is protective. We want people to be reassured by that."
2020-03-09,17:57,Jerome Adams,"We want people to know that we are really focusing in on those groups that are at highest risk for complications, and helping them understand how to be safe. And this new advice that’s going to be coming out tomorrow is designed to keep our community safe, to help keep the most vulnerable safe, and it’s important to understand, that even though young people aren’t at risk for dying from Coronavirus, they can potentially spread that to older people in the communities, and people with chronic diseases."
2020-03-09,18:25,Jerome Adams,"So it’s important we all take precautions, washing our hands, covering our cough, keeping our distance from people who are sick, and taking the steps that will be coming out in this new guidance to help make sure we’re doing everything we know possible to keep our most vulnerable protected."
2020-03-09,18:41,Mike Pence,Great. Well done. Thank you. I think the Surgeon General raises a very important point.
2020-03-09,18:50,Mike Pence,"My mother is 88 years young. My stepfather is about the same age. This is just a really good time, what Doctor Fauci tells us, what the experts tell us is, is to look after family members, loved ones who are senior citizens, and particularly those who have serious underlying health conditions."
2020-03-09,19:10,Mike Pence,"All the data Doctor Birx confirms to us that they’re the most vulnerable to serious consequences if they contract the coronavirus. But the guidance that we would ask members of the media and the American public looking on, you can go to Coronavirus.gov, and this information to be posted tonight."
2020-03-09,19:33,Mike Pence,"And hopefully it will be useful, helpful, common sense for families, for schools, for businesses, and for commercial establishments that welcome the public in, just to create the kind of practices that we believe will mitigate the spread of the Coronavirus across the country as a whole."
2020-03-09,19:56,Mike Pence,"But with regard to seniors, I might just ask Seema Verna to step up and speak about … Last week at the President’s direction, we raised the standards for every nursing home in America, with regard to infectious disease, and we are deploying all 8,000 of our inspectors in every state, as we told the governors today, to focus exclusively on infectious disease compliance at our nursing homes."
2020-03-09,20:23,Mike Pence,"Our hearts break for the families at the Kirkland Nursing Home in Seattle. The loss of life has been grievous, but we are sending the message out, working with our governors, to make sure our nursing homes and long term care facilities have the additional layer of protection against the spread of the coronavirus, and maybe you’d give us [inaudible 00:20:44]."
2020-03-09,20:44,Seema Verma,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. As he said, that’s exactly where our focus is. It’s around infection control, and we’re working with the entire healthcare industry. Today, We issued more guidance to nursing homes about really opening their screening of people that are coming into the nursing home and making sure that they’re gloved, and they have masks, so that we can protect people that are in the nursing homes."
2020-03-09,21:05,Seema Verma,"The other thing that we’re doing is because we know that many of our senior citizens are vulnerable, we want to make sure that they know that the Medicare program is behind them, and we’re here to support them. We’re letting our patients know that they can get a coronavirus test, and that there is no cost sharing associated with that, for our seniors on the Medicare program."
2020-03-09,21:25,Seema Verma,"We’re also letting them know that because of the President’s leadership over a year and a half ago, he took action to actually extend more telehealth benefits to our nation’s seniors. And this is a very historic change that we made under the president’s leadership. And so, if they’re sick and they’re ill, they can call their doctor, they can Skype with their doctor, and Medicare will reimburse for those services. And we’ve also in our conversations with governors today, we’ve talked about having telehealth services also available in the Medicaid program."
2020-03-09,21:53,Mike Pence,"Great. Let me invite Bob Kadlec who is a Deputy Secretary of HHS, to come forward, as well, to fill us in on the latest on the progress on the Grand Princess-"
2020-03-09,22:07,Robert Kadlec,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
2020-03-09,22:08,Mike Pence,"That is dockside now, and is going through a very careful process of having Americans and foreign nationals come off, and everyone will be tested."
2020-03-09,22:18,Jerome Adams,"Thank you very much, sir. And yes, we began our medical operation to basically disembark those passengers. On Saturday, we put in place the medical crew on that boat, to augment the physicians and nurses that were already on the ship. We basically ensured that the quarantine on the boat and no isolation were being enforced, and then evaluated first the children, and those who are ill, identifying anyone who is severely ill if possible."
2020-03-09,22:43,Jerome Adams,"When the boat arrived on dockside today, additional medical personnel came on board and we began an orderly disembarkation. Our intent is to basically disembark about half of the passengers on the boat today, and the other half tomorrow. And everyone will be medically screened before they get off. If there’s any question about their physical, or health, they’ll be screened again more additionally."
2020-03-09,23:05,Jerome Adams,"And then they’ll be transferred to one of this four quarantine sites in the United States, Travis Air Force base, Miramar Naval Air Station, Lackland Air Force Base, and Dobbins Air Force Base in Georgia. The foreign passengers will be transferred, the Canadians will be taken back to Canada, and we’re working with the United Kingdom to return their passengers back to the United Kingdom."
2020-03-09,23:27,Jerome Adams,"But we’re doing this all in cooperation with the great support of the state of California, the city of Oakland, and with the support of the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the us coast guard. Thank you."
2020-03-09,23:38,Mike Pence,"Great. And on the subject of testing, we had a very good discussion today, as I mentioned, with 47 governors, and I outlined for them all of the different testing methods that are available. We have tests now in every state lab in America, but we’re rapidly expanding that, and let me ask the secretary of HHS to give us the latest on the availability of testing to the American public and to the States."
2020-03-09,24:09,Alex Azar,"Great. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. So we continue with our strategic plan at HHS across, all of the components represented by many of the leaders here, which is to diagnose, to treat, to contain, to mitigate, to research and communicate. It’s what we do in a healthcare crisis situation."
2020-03-09,24:27,Alex Azar,"One element of that is the test, which of course CDC developed in record time after getting the genetic sequence posted from China. That then was available at CDC, and from that point on, there was no individual that a public health official needed to get tested."
2020-03-09,24:42,Alex Azar,"The CDC didn’t have surplus capacity to test, but we’ve been moving progressively to bring that test closer and closer and closer to the patient, and to the bedside, and to make it as easy as possible for us to use testing, very much in line with our peer countries, facing similar epidemiological circumstances."
2020-03-09,24:59,Alex Azar,"At this point, we, as many of you who were here on Saturday for the briefing know, we have over one million tests that have shipped from CDC, and to private contractors that are the CDC type of test. Those are now out, and as the Vice President mentioned, every state public health lab is validated, and operating those tests. In addition, hundreds of thousands of those tests are in hospitals, in private labs, in commercial labs."
2020-03-09,25:25,Alex Azar,"We now have a total of 2.1 million tests that are available, either shipped, or waiting to be shipped, or waiting to be ordered. We, by the end of this week, expect to be able to be producing up to four million tests per week in the United States."
2020-03-09,25:43,Alex Azar,"That is on top of what the private commercial entities, the companies you know of, like LabCorp or Quest using their technology, the test that they’re getting out, which is an even better experience for the patient because those work, they are able to actually collect samples directly in doctor’s offices, have a very sophisticated collection system to their labs. Again, making it a very, much more seamless patient experience."
2020-03-09,26:08,Alex Azar,"They’re now validated, and getting up and running, and that, you’ll see even more of that. So as I said, over the next week or so, you’re just going to see a progressively better patient and physician and provider experience connected to diagnostic testing here in the United States. Thank you."
2020-03-09,26:24,Unnamed,One moment. I want to ask Mr. Azar [crosstalk 00:10:26]-
2020-03-09,26:24,Alex Azar,"Well, let me-"
2020-03-09,26:24,Mike Pence,"Well, we’ll have questions in just a moment."
2020-03-09,26:24,Alex Azar,Yeah.
2020-03-09,26:28,Mike Pence,"And we’ll come back. We’ll come back. With that, I want to invite the director of CDC to come forward, just to give you an overview of where we are in the country, with regard to cases, and then we’ll take questions on any of the topics."
2020-03-09,26:46,Dr. Robert Redfield,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We do continue to see an increased number in cases. Again, as we said, we would, as time passes, we’re currently having over 500 cases now in the United States, outside of the repatriation cases, and the cases on the Diamond Princes."
2020-03-09,27:05,Dr. Robert Redfield,"We now have cases in 35 states that have been reported, and the District of Columbia. I want to reiterate what the Vice President said, despite what I just said here, is that at the present time, the risk of the American public does remain low."
2020-03-09,27:21,Dr. Robert Redfield,"We do have several community outbreaks, which we’re focusing on in the Seattle area, in the Santa Clara, California area, in Westminster, in New York, and in Florida, and these are areas that we’re investigating heavily, to try to understand the transmission mechanisms there, and begin to help these jurisdictions begin to operationalize a series of mitigation strategies to help, again, to slow and contain the outbreak. Thank you."
2020-03-09,27:51,Mike Pence,"And let me say, just before we go to questions, coronavirus.gov. For the American public, for healthcare professionals, it is a comprehensive website. We’re adding to it every day. And also, Dr. Birx, we’re working very diligently to establish a single website, where people can go to track all of the cases, and where they’re emerging. Questions?"
2020-03-09,28:15,Unnamed,"Can I ask you and Secretary Mnuchin, if I could-"
2020-03-09,28:18,Mike Pence,"Yeah, please."
2020-03-09,28:18,Unnamed,"The stock market, a huge slide today, and people on Wall Street now talking about the possibility of a recession. Some people saying it’s a better than 50-50 chance that that will happen. How worried are you that that will happen?"
2020-03-09,28:29,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, let me just first say, today was an unprecedented move in the oil markets, so we saw a overnight reaction, of over down 20%, and that’s obviously what had a major component today on the stock market. But let me just make a couple of comments more broadly about the economy."
2020-03-09,28:46,Steve Mnuchin,"First of all, we couldn’t be more pleased that coming into the situation with the coronavirus, the U S has the most resilient economy in the world. You saw a very large economic jobs number last month, and we couldn’t be more pleased that the president’s economic programs of tax cuts, regulatory relief and trade, have put the economy in a very good position."
2020-03-09,29:07,Steve Mnuchin,"I would also just say that I am in daily conversations with Chair Powell. We are committed and we just had a meeting with the President and the economic team. The President is committed that whatever support we need to provide to the US economy, we will use all our tools, working very closely with the regulators."
2020-03-09,29:27,Steve Mnuchin,"The President has the bank CEOs coming in this week. We’ll be talking to them about what they can do, to help small businesses and companies that are impacted. So let me just, again, emphasize our primary focus is, there are parts of the economy that are going to be impacted, especially workers that need to be at home, hard working people who are at home under quarantine or taking care of their family. We’ll be working on a program to address that."
2020-03-09,29:55,Steve Mnuchin,"We will also be working with small businesses, who need liquidity, through SBA programs. We’re looking at alternatives at the IRS. We have large tax payments coming up, of providing certain relief, to two companies and individuals for liquidity. So the President is 100% committed that we will provide whatever tools we need, that the economy will be in very good shape a year from now. This is not like the financial crisis, where we don’t know the end in sight. This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months."
2020-03-09,30:32,Mike Pence,Follow up?
2020-03-09,30:33,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, let me just say there are certain authorities that the President has that we can do on our own, and we’ve already cataloged those tools. We have a large group, a sub-task force of Treasury and NEC working on this."
2020-03-09,30:47,Steve Mnuchin,"We are also working with bipartisan leadership, on a whole range of alternatives that we’ll be discussing with them tomorrow. And as you know, we had bipartisan agreement on the spending deal. We will use the same approach to work with the leadership on the House and the Senate on this."
2020-03-09,31:03,Steve Mnuchin,[crosstalk 00:31:05].
2020-03-09,31:03,Unnamed,"You’ve just said that you have not been tested. You said you don’t know if the President has been tested, but today we’ve learned that the president has interacted with two lawmakers who have interacted with someone who is positive for coronavirus, so why not get tested?"
2020-03-09,31:19,Mike Pence,"Well, I just simply don’t know what the White House physician has recommended to the president, but I promise you we’ll get you that information."
2020-03-09,31:24,Unnamed,When do you think you could let us know if the president has been tested?
2020-03-09,31:28,Mike Pence,"We’ll let you know tonight. Right away. [crosstalk 00:31:31] Yeah, look, this is a… Obviously, the White House physician is, their directive is to see to the health and well-being of the president of the United States, and we’ll get you a very direct answer on that."
2020-03-09,31:44,Mike Pence,[crosstalk 00:31:46].
2020-03-09,31:44,Unnamed,Is your staff being required to be tested?
2020-03-09,31:46,Mike Pence,"I’ve had no recommendation that I would be tested. But let me, let me just say to everyone, I really do believe that the guidance that we put out today would be very helpful and very encouraging to Americans. It was fashioned by Dr…."
2020-03-09,32:03,Mike Pence,"… Very helpful and very encouraging to Americans. It was fashioned by Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, some of the leading experts in infectious disease in the world. And for families that are looking on tonight, to go to coronavirus.gov. You can find information about how you can just make your home safer, your family safer, your school safer, your business safer, and we recommend that to your attention."
2020-03-09,32:23,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-03-09,32:23,Mike Pence,"Yes, please?"
2020-03-09,32:25,Unnamed,"Do you believe and does the president believe that what happened in the stock market today and what we’re seeing among the American industry, some of which the president named today as being affected and in trouble here, are in any way a result of this White House’s reaction to the coronavirus crisis? Is this the markets and American businesses saying that you guys are not enough and didn’t think enough ahead?"
2020-03-09,32:53,Mike Pence,"Well, I have to tell you, I’m about a week and a half into being asked to lead the president’s White House coronavirus task force and the men and women standing behind me and all the men and women standing behind them have done a remarkable job responding to this. The president’s decision to suspend all travel from China. Dr. Fauci I think reflected just last night on national television about the time that that bought us, the decisive action in declaring a public health emergency. I really do believe that the American people can see that this president is putting the health of the American people first."
2020-03-09,33:37,Mike Pence,"But make no mistake about it, as we go forward and particularly as we have more testing available and we have these communities that have community spread there will be more cases, but we simply ask … We ask today for the American public to join with us in the common sense practices that will mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. And also particularly we’re asking every American to look after our seniors who have serious underlying health issues. They are clearly the most vulnerable. And that’s where the focus of our energy is today. Even as we do everything that we can, working with governors at every level, state and local public health officials to limit the spread."
2020-03-09,34:27,Unnamed,"If I could ask you a question, Dr. Carson, thank you. Mr. Vice President, you’re up there."
2020-03-09,34:32,Mike Pence,Okay.
2020-03-09,34:35,Unnamed,"More and more organizations, charities are canceling fundraising events, other events is, is that proven? Is that an overreaction? Do you think the president should continue with campaign rallies and do you believe that people, even if they’re healthy, should get on board a cruise ship?"
2020-03-09,34:58,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Okay, so there’s multiple different questions on it. So the idea about individual entities, governors, mayors or whatever, canceling activities that are not coming from a direct recommendation from the federal government. I think that they have a … I don’t think, I know they have the authority to do that, but what they’re probably acting on is what they would consider for their citizens and abundance of caution. Most of the time when that happens, it usually is in an area where there is already documented community spread, and Dr. Redfield mentioned the four areas right now that are having community spread that’s documented. But there may be, as we know, it’s a possibility that there’s community spread going on in areas in which we are not detecting it yet. And I think that’s the response of the individuals, be they mayors or governors who have you who are doing that, so I wouldn’t criticize them for that. They’re using their own individual judgment and to me I think that that would be prudent."
2020-03-09,36:03,Unnamed,Anything else?
2020-03-09,36:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You know, I can’t comment on campaign rallies. It really depends. We are having, as we’ve all said, this is something in motion. This is an evolving thing, so not sure what we’re going to be able to say at the time where you have a campaign rally. If you’re talking about a campaign rally tomorrow in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment. If you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, I think that’s a judgment call and if someone decides they want to cancel it, I wouldn’t publicly criticize them."
2020-03-09,36:46,Unnamed,"I asked one last one about cruise ships because a lot of people are planning cruises over the spring break. Would you recommend that anybody, even a healthy person get on board?"
2020-03-09,36:56,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I think if you’re a healthy young person that there is no reason, if you want to go on a cruise ship to go on cruise ship. Personally, I would never go on a cruise ship because I don’t like cruises. But that’s another story. But the fact is that if you have the conditions that I’ve been speaking about over and over again to this group, namely an individual who has an underlying condition, particularly an elderly person that has underlying condition, I would recommend strongly that they do not go on a cruise ship."
2020-03-09,37:30,Mike Pence,"Let me also say John, I think you raise a good point for we’re expecting a proposal tomorrow. DHS, the coast guard, all of our health officials are currently discussing with the cruise line industry. I was in Miami on Saturday. We made it very clear that we needed cruise lines to be safer to establish and to embrace new protocols, screening onboard off new medical protocols, shipboard processes for evacuating people that may contract a coronavirus or a serious illness. And I know the president was grateful that our, our cruise line leadership all stepped up to the table. They said they’re ready to go to the next level. And so we’ll be reviewing that proposal tomorrow with the objective that apart from the Americans that Dr. Fauci just described, the seniors with serious underlying conditions, we’re going to work with the cruise line industry to improve the safety, improve the health environment on cruise lines in the short term and in the longterm."
2020-03-09,38:42,Unnamed,"Thank you. Sorry, I got it. Last time president Trump was in this room. He told us that the number of US cases was 15 and would soon go down to zero. You guys are saying today that the number is going up and it’s more than 500. What is the discrepancy and how was he so wrong on that number?"
2020-03-09,38:59,Mike Pence,"Look, I think what the president was referring to is that we will have people that test positive and then they get better. President Trump wants the American people to know, and I’m going to ask Dr. Birx to reflect on this for a moment. The vast majority of people who contract the coronavirus will get better. And the president has just challenged our task force as the numbers grow, and they will. We’ll continue to test more and more Americans. We are as I’m standing here. It’s also important to remember that people, the vast majority get better completely. Some large percentage have mild flu symptoms, some have serious flu symptoms. But then of course for the Americans, you heard the surgeon general refer to seniors with underlying serious health conditions dr. Fauci referred to. We’re committed to lean in and to make sure they have the support they need. But the president’s focus here is just making sure people understand that while the numbers grow, there are people that come off the list because they get better. And Dr. Birx, did you want to reflect on what we know about the cycle of the coronavirus?"
2020-03-09,40:20,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, thank you. So we know the coronavirus reacts a lot like the flu in the way it’s spreads and in the way we prevent it. And so when we put out the guidelines to the American people, they will reinforce the guidelines and we hope the number of flu cases go down too, because people will really be what we call situational awareness. I did want to add one piece to our cautions about people with preexisting condition. We also know that there are children with preexisting conditions and we know that there are individuals that are undergoing chemotherapy for their treatment of cancer."
2020-03-09,40:58,Dr. Deborah Birx,"For those individuals, if they have what we call decreased number of white cells, and they will have that discussions with the doctors. They are given often a sheet of paper that really describes how they need to protect themselves and how their family needs to protect them. So I want to make sure that we understand, yes, we’re concerned about the elderly, we’re concerned about others with preexisting condition, but we’re also concerned about anybody who may be in an immuno … What we call an immunodeficiency state, having less white cells and less able to combat any virus. We want to protect all of them from the flu and we want to protect all of them from coronavirus. And that’s why these guidelines are particularly important."
2020-03-09,41:44,Mike Pence,"It really is really important, I think, and I’m going to ask all of the journalists in the room, do what you can to distribute this information. Coronavirus.gov Because exactly the reason that Dr. Birx just said so well that we want to make sure that families have the tools, businesses have the tools, even in areas where we don’t have a significant outbreak of the coronavirus, we want to make sure that the American people have the tools to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Particularly with regard to the most vulnerable."
2020-03-09,42:16,Unnamed,"Yes. Earlier you said you’d tell us how many Americans have already been tested and as a followup to a question was asked earlier, are the president’s tweets hurting your efforts at all? Because he’s accused the Democrats and some of the members of the press of making more of this than he says it is. He’s made lighter of it then you all have here. So have his tweets hurt you and can you please tell us how many Americans have been tested?"
2020-03-09,42:40,Mike Pence,"I’m happy to do that. A lot of the president’s leadership has made the difference here. I heard it again today from 47 governors, Governor Larry Hogan joined me in the situation room. He’s the chairman of the National Governors Association. I think every American would be inspired if you could see the way, under the president’s leadership and in cooperation with governors in every state and every territory, we literally are working seamlessly on behalf of the health of the American people. I’m going to invite the secretary of HHS to come up and speak about the number of tests that have been done and where we are. The tests that are available, he’s addressed. But in terms of those that have been conducted,"
2020-03-09,43:23,Alex Azar,"So we’ve told you, we’ll tell you what we know and what we don’t know. Okay? So there are different types of tests that get sent out. The CDC’s test the CDC is sending out. That’s that 70 … Enough to test 75,000 people that was sent out last week. Those go to public health labs, about 80 labs in the United States, one in each state at least. Those report results back in to the CDC because they’re part of the public health network."
2020-03-09,43:55,Alex Azar,"The larger quantity of tests that shipped, about 900,000 of the tests that shipped by this weekend. And then so many of the remainder of that two point total, 2.1 million tests. Those go to hospitals, private labs, others for testing. They don’t currently have to report to us that they’ve conducted a test or what the result of that test is. The CDC is actively working right now to build that IT connectivity with them so we can gather that information. So right now I could not give you a number of how many Americans have received a test because many will have received a test through hospitals or non-public health labs. And so let’s work we’re getting the system, the IT system up through CDC. We want to give you accurate information as we go."
2020-03-09,44:43,Mike Pence,"Hey everyone. Thank you all for being here. We will be back here tomorrow and we’ll continue to bring the latest information forward to the American people. Again, let me encourage all of you here and everyone looking on around the country to go to coronavirus.gov to get really useful, practical, common sense recommendations about how to make your home safer, how to make your school safer, how to make your business and any enterprise out there safer. These are practical recommendations from the best experts in America and we commend them to your attention, but let me also just have a word of encouragement to everyone."
2020-03-09,45:28,Mike Pence,"I want to say again, all of our medical experts, apart from the areas where we have community spread and we’re focusing resource, the risk of contracting the coronavirus for the average American remains low. It will remain that way moreso if all of us continue to practice common sense habits in our home, in our businesses, in our schools, in our public institutions, and so it’s important to remember what President Trump said. We’re all in this together. It’s not just going to be a whole of government approach. It’s a whole of America approach. And together we’ll get through the coronavirus. Again, details on all the latest information. Coronavirus.gov. Thank you."
2020-03-09,46:13,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:46:15].
2020-03-10,00:04,Mike Pence,"Good afternoon. We just completed today’s meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and I couldn’t be more proud of the efforts of the men and women standing behind me or all of those standing behind them. President Trump said from early on that this would be a whole of government approach, and today gives evidence to the fact that it is also a whole of America approach. We’re bringing the full resources of the Federal Government and the full resources of this great economy, and our great business sector to bear in protecting the American people and protecting American families."
2020-03-10,00:44,Mike Pence,"A few updates from today, as we continue to expand testing availability across the country. Testing is now available at all state labs. By the end of this week, there will be more than 4 million more tests made available in jurisdictions around the country. 1 million are already in place thanks to the good work of our top commercial labs that the President Trump brought together yesterday. LabCorp and Quest are in the process now of distributing and marketing Coronavirus tests all across America. And we’re working with state and local officials to ensure that that happens as rapidly as possible."
2020-03-10,01:27,Mike Pence,"As the testing is expanding, we wanted to make sure the American people knew that testing was available to them and that costs would not be a barrier. Today, president Trump assembled the top health insurance executives in America, and as we announced earlier today, all of our major health insurance companies have now joined with Medicare and Medicaid and agreed to waive all copays, cover the cost of all treatment for those who can track the Coronavirus. They’ve committed to no surprise billing, and they’ve committed to encourage telemedicine. It was a year ago that Medicaid actually expanded to pay for a telemedicine. Medicare pays for telemedicine. So now for seniors who may think that they are either at risk or have contracted the disease, they can get medical advice without having to go to the doctor or go to an emergency room."
2020-03-10,02:29,Mike Pence,"I know I speak for President Trump when I say how grateful we are to see our health insurance industry step forward to meet this need so that no American should be concerned about being able to pay for or afford the cost of a Coronavirus test if they deem, and their doctor deems it to be appropriate and necessary."
2020-03-10,02:51,Mike Pence,"The President also went to Capitol Hill today to meet with members of the United States Senate Republican caucus. There he talked about an economic package including a call he’s calling for payroll tax relief, and I think most important to the president’s heart, we want to make sure that hourly workers, hardworking blue collar Americans that may not have paid family leave today, that small and medium size businesses in America would be afforded the resources to provide paid leave so that no one would feel that they have to go to work if they might be infected or if they might’ve been exposed to the Coronavirus. We had a good reception on Capitol Hill. Our legislative teams have fanned out. We’re going to be working with Republican and Democrat leadership to move an economic package. Larry Kudlow will be reflecting on that in just a few moments."
2020-03-10,03:43,Mike Pence,"We also talked about what are known as N95 masks and we’re working Senator Deb Fischer and others have important legislation that would extend temporary liability protection so that masks that are made for industrial use could be sold to hospitals to ensure that our healthcare workers are properly protected and outfitted. And we’re grateful for growing bipartisan support for that measure, and we’re going to be working earnestly with Republicans and Democrats to move a reform that would make more N95 masks available."
2020-03-10,04:22,Mike Pence,"I’m also pleased to report that we did receive this afternoon a comprehensive proposal from the cruise line industry, a proposal that includes advanced screening, improving medical services on ships, providing for air lift evacuation and land-based care at the expense of the cruise lines for anyone that might be not only infected with the Coronavirus, but with any serious illness. We’ll be reviewing that in the next 24 hours. The president’s objective is for us to make cruise lines a safer, even as we’ve worked with the cruise lines to ensure that no one in our particularly vulnerable population is going out on a cruise in the near future."
2020-03-10,05:08,Mike Pence,"I’m going to recognize Dr. Fauci to talk about where we are, and Dr. Birx will give us some research that she’s done on the scope. We’ll have other updates. But let me say once again, this is a whole of government approach. And from early on, President Trump has insisted that our government at the federal level, all of our partners at the state level work in concert to protect the American people. And as we stand here today, the risks to the average American of contracting the Coronavirus remains low. But we’re absolutely determined to give every American the tools and the information that they need to protect themselves, their families, their workplace, their schools. And, and we’re going to work together. We’re going to work together to see our way through this, and working with leaders in both parties, in Congress, working with leaders at the state level all across this nation. I’m confident we will. With that, Dr Tony Fauci for an update on the status."
2020-03-10,06:13,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, thank you very much Mr. Vice President. Just to give you a very brief sketch of what we do every day, the cases continue to increase globally. We are paying particular attention to the cases in Europe and Italy and France in which we’re starting to see that up at the same time as the relative number of new cases come down from China. What we’re seeing in Europe is that Europe is in that up slope, so that’s something that is expected. That’s the way these kinds of outbreaks go. This is not a surprise to anybody if you look at the history of infectious diseases outbreaks."
2020-03-10,06:48,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"In the United States, we continue to have new cases. As of this morning, there was 712, I believe, with 27 deaths guaranteed by the time of this evening, that’s going to be up, and there’ll be several more, and tomorrow there’ll be several more. So we realize that this is something obviously that we’ve been saying all along that we’re taking very seriously."
2020-03-10,07:10,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Now the question is what are we going to do about that? And there are a number of things that one can do in order to blunt it. If you look at the curves of outbreaks, they go big peaks and then they come down. What we need to do is flatten that down. That would have less people infected, that would ultimately have less deaths. You do that by trying to interfere with the natural flow of the outbreak. So what we’re saying today is that although we keep coming in and saying appropriately that as a nation, the risk is relatively low, there are parts of the country right now that are having community spread in which the risk there is clearly a bit more than that, and you know the places, Washington State, California, New York and Florida."
2020-03-10,07:56,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"But what I want to talk to you about today, just for a moment or two, is that we would like the country to realize that as a nation we can’t be doing the kinds of things we were doing a few months ago. That it doesn’t matter if you’re in a state that has no cases or one case, you have to start taking seriously what you can do now that if and when the infections will come, and they will come, sorry to say, sad to say they will, but when you’re dealing with an infectious disease, we always have that metaphor that people talk about that Wayne Gretzky, he doesn’t go where the pack is, he’s going where the pack is going to be. Well, we want to be where the infection is going to be as well as where it is."
2020-03-10,08:42,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So what we have here, if you could see that here, what… It’s here, is that if you go to coronavirus.gov remember when Dr. Birx yesterday mentioned some of the things that we put together. These are really simple. Keeping the workplace safe, keeping the home safe, keeping the school safe, and keeping commercial establishment safe. This should be universal for the country. Everyone should be doing that. Whether you live in a zone that has community spread or not. When you have community spread, you obviously going to ratchet up the kinds of mitigations that you have, but at a minimum. This is the minimum that we should be doing. So everybody should say all hands on deck. This is what we need to do. So I’ll stop there, and later I’ll be happy to answer."
2020-03-10,09:28,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-10,09:30,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr. Vice President, and thank you Dr. Fauci for that clarity. We continue to monitor the situation across the country and across the globe, and we are very fortunate between Dr. Fauci and I, we have longterm contacts out there in many of these countries that are experiencing current outbreaks. We continue to review all the scientific literature to look for insights and to really determine who’s at the greatest risk. And that’s why we’ve talked to you about people with immunodeficiencies at any age, people with medical conditions, and the elderly, and how important it is for all of us to take these precautions in the household to protect others, because we have circulating flu and other respiratory diseases at this time. We all have to act like all of those diseases, any respiratory disease can be transmitted to others. And as we said yesterday, we’re hoping that decreases all the respiratory disease we’re experiencing."
2020-03-10,10:24,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, we got more new reports out of China, who had nine pregnant women during an acute COVID infection, and all nine were infected. And they delivered while they were infected, and all nine babies were healthy and the mothers were healthy. So we continue to look for data like that to be reassuring to the American public, at the same time, ensuring that every single person is participating in this response to this virus and taking those precautions that we should be taking every day. If we start doing this today, we will be ready next year for any of our respiratory diseases because I think we’ll be able to show that these simple household, simple works, simple schools, simple business approaches across the country can change all of our respiratory diseases. So we thank you for getting the message out. We thank you for the participating, and ensuring in your households and on households around America that we’re protecting all of those who need our support right now."
2020-03-10,11:24,Mike Pence,"Excellent. Thank you. Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci. And this information is available at coronavirus. gov, and as we said, we can’t say often enough, the risks of contracting the Coronavirus to the average American remains low. But for senior citizens with serious underlying chronic health conditions, the potential for serious consequences is very real. And make no mistake about it, by these habits in your home, in your school, in your business, you’re not only protecting your health, but you’re also protecting those that are most vulnerable. With that for an update on our progress the President Trump made today with our health insurance companies. I’d like to recognize Seema Verma."
2020-03-10,12:15,Seema Verma,"As the Vice President said, we had a terrific meeting with the insurance companies, a real example of a public private partnership where they agreed to waive copays for testing, not do any surprise billing, and also cover the costs of the COVID virus associated costs. The other things that they did is they asked the president for more flexibility in Medicare advantage plans and the president agreed to do that, and so today we issued guidance to our Medicare advantage plans that not only can they waive the costs for the test, but they can also go further to removing prior authorization requirements, they can waive prescription refill limits, they can allow for mail delivery of prescription drugs, and expand more access to telehealth services if they weren’t offering that in their plan."
2020-03-10,13:02,Seema Verma,"Also at CMS, we continue to work with healthcare providers around infection control practices. We met with home health agencies and also hospitals, and today we issued guidance to dialysis facilities as well as home health agencies around infection control."
2020-03-10,13:19,Mike Pence,"It’s been a great deal of attention about the Grand Princess and HHS working with the coast guard, with the department of defense, is currently working through disembarking American passengers returning foreign nationals to their country, and I wanted to ask Secretary Azar to speak and update us on the progress."
2020-03-10,13:41,Alex Azar,"Thank you. So with regard to the Grand Princess, I wanted to first express our appreciation to Governor Newsome to the mayor of Oakland, the people of Oakland, the Longshoreman, the Stevedores who’ve helped with bringing it in and clearing the dock area so that we can do all of our operations there. We’ve got Admiral Abel here with us today who’s been leading the coast guard efforts, and then Deputy Secretary Biegun from state has done incredible work with our foreign partners to help with the repatriation of their nationals who are on board the ship."
2020-03-10,14:11,Alex Azar,"As of our data that I’ve got is as of noon Pacific time today, so this will have increased quite substantially since, since my last update, but as of noon Pacific, we had 548 individuals who have been offloaded from the ship. 228 Canadians are already back in Canada, flown there, I believe it was overnight. 171 Californians were taken by the government of California and are now at Travis Air Base. 26 individuals were sick and they are being treated for various, it could be from the novel Coronavirus. It could also just be we had some frail individuals who are sick that needed treatment."
2020-03-10,14:51,Alex Azar,"Our goal is to get all of the citizens of California off today to be in the care of the California State government, as well as to get the UK citizens off today so that they could be repatriated to the United Kingdom. We continue to work with other countries on all of those maneuvers. We will have non-California residents who will be in transport to the bases at Dobbins and at Lackland today we hope, or tonight. So everything is progressing. It seems to be progressing well. We’re using the highest isolation, quarantine procedures, medical screenings possible to ensure the safety of not just the passengers, but also of the local communities and all of the healthcare workers and others, emergency responders are helping. So thanks to all of our partners for their help with this very complex operation."
2020-03-10,15:44,Mike Pence,"Good report. And let me echo the secretary’s appreciation to Governor Gavin Newsome, the State of California, the City of Oakland. It has literally been a seamless partnership. Everyone on that ship will be tested, isolated, and quarantined as appropriate and provided with treatment."
2020-03-10,16:03,Mike Pence,"… quarantined as appropriate and provided with treatment. The crew on the ship other than those who were ill, will be quarantined on the ship offshore. But it really represented the kind of partnership and cooperation from every level of government that every American I know is grateful to see. With that, on the economic front, Larry Kudlow."
2020-03-10,16:29,Larry Kudlow,"Thank you, sir. I yesterday had a meeting in the Oval with the President, acknowledging there are going to be challenges on the health and economic side. He mentioned that he intended to bring the full power of the federal government to deal with these challenges. And accordingly, as the vice president said, up at the Republican Senate luncheon today and he mentioned that in this room yesterday, President Trump has unveiled his proposals. Strong proposals for a temporary payroll tax cut holiday, which I think he would prefer to last through the end of the year."
2020-03-10,17:11,Larry Kudlow,"Also, administratively, as Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and others have suggested, we are trying to… We will use assistance to unpaid sick leave people. Very important point. Also, small and medium businesses, another important point. And also, possibly to some distressed industries or sectors in the economy, maybe tax deferral might be a useful tool and other means. So this is a strong across the board package. We are consulting with leaders in the House and the Senate with respect to this package and particularly, the payroll tax holiday."
2020-03-10,17:52,Larry Kudlow,"Let me just say, coming into this difficult period, the economy is in fundamentally good shape. We saw a blockbuster jobs report last Friday. Today for example, the small business confidence index, the NFIB business confidence index, registered a very strong number keeping its near record high. The unemployment remains low at 3.5%. Other indicators look pretty good. We had a lot of momentum in the first quarter, good thing. I recognize the challenges, and that is why we are proposing these fiscal measures to combine with monetary measures that have already taken. And again, I will repeat the President’s words. It just struck me as his determination. He intends to bring the full power of the federal government to deal with these health and economic challenges."
2020-03-10,18:48,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Larry. Well said. And a word from Surgeon General, Jerome Adams. General."
2020-03-10,18:56,Jerome Adams,"Good evening, everyone. As Surgeon General, whether it’s opioids or cigarettes or the coronavirus, my job is to help the American people understand how to live a healthy life. And I’m asking all of you, I’m imploring all of you, to help share my prescription for America to overcome this coronavirus situation that we’re in."
2020-03-10,19:17,Jerome Adams,"There are three parts to it. Number one, know your risk. As you’ve heard many times, but it’s still important to impress upon America, if you are immunocompromised, if you have chronic medical conditions, if you are over the age of 60, you are at higher risk. If you are a child or young adult, you are less likely to be impacted by the coronavirus."
2020-03-10,19:37,Jerome Adams,"Number two, the second part of the prescription. Know your circumstances. Are you in an environment where you can telework? Are you planning on going to large gatherings, like church? Do you live in a community that is being particularly impacted by the coronavirus? You can find out this information from your state or local health department. Does your state have a hotline that you can call into to help you assess symptoms? Again, knowing your circumstances."
2020-03-10,20:03,Jerome Adams,"And number three, and this is the most important part. Know what you can do to stay safe. And we have really leaned into coronavirus.gov. Please, send people to that website. We put the tools on there for individual groups, specific audiences, so that people can understand how to stay safe. If we follow this prescription, we will overcome the coronavirus. As Dr. Fauci said, we will see more cases. Unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths. We have not hit the peak of this epidemic quite yet. But if we follow this prescription, then we will decrease the number of people who are impacted. We will decrease the number of people who will die, and we will more quickly get to the end of this situation. Thank you."
2020-03-10,20:50,Mike Pence,Great job. Questions. Please.
2020-03-10,20:52,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, that poster right there, it says to avoid crowding, consider a rearranging large activities. So will the Pence/Trump campaign suspend campaign rallies and other activities?"
2020-03-10,21:03,Mike Pence,"I think that will be a decision that’s made literally, on a day-to-day basis. I thought Dr. Fauci spoke to that yesterday very well, that we’re going to… I’m very confident that the campaign will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward. But these proposals are things that every American can do all across the country that will reduce the risk of either contracting or being exposed to the coronavirus."
2020-03-10,21:36,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, on the economic package. The word “unveiled” was just used. But so far, the public has not seen it. How big is this package? How big is the payroll tax cut going to be? When is the general public going to see what you all put together?"
2020-03-10,21:52,Mike Pence,Right. Larry.
2020-03-10,21:54,Larry Kudlow,"We are working out details right now, so I don’t want to quote any numbers ahead of time. You know, you make a proposal. We’re checking with the leaders of both parties in both houses, and see what is doable, and where the tough nuts are going to be. I don’t want to get into any detail."
2020-03-10,22:13,Larry Kudlow,"I think the outline of the thing is very important. The payroll tax holiday is probably the most important powerful piece of this. But on the other hand, I want to draw attention. We can use administration and executive authority again, to help unpaid sick leave people, which is very important. We can use it for the medium and smaller businesses, which is very important. Other distressed sectors, we have some leverage on tax deferral. We know."
2020-03-10,22:49,Larry Kudlow,"I mean look, I will say again as I have for quite some time, the economy is strong. We also know there are going to be problems ahead. We know there are going to be challenges ahead, don’t deny it. We’ll see. I want to take that a day at a time, and a fact at a time, a statistical release at a time. But anyway, this will be the broad package. At some point in the near future, we will outline a more detailed package for you."
2020-03-10,23:13,Mike Pence,Go ahead.
2020-03-10,23:15,Unnamed (Reporter),"Actually maybe while Larry’s still up there, unless you want to answer it, Mr. Vice President, go right ahead. The President proposed to the GOP policy lunch today, to remove the entire payroll tax from both employers and employees. That would be a 12.4% reduction. Back in 2010, we had a 2% reduction. Can you basically eliminate for however number of months, the payroll tax, without blowing a huge hole in the budget? And furthermore, the President told the lunch, he’d like to make that cut permanent. How do you do that?"
2020-03-10,23:54,Larry Kudlow,"The payroll tax holiday is a bold move. It’s a very bold move. And this has always been a bold President. We’ve been cutting taxes and rolling back regulations, and changing trade deals and opening up the energy sector, and doing things that nobody thought we could do before, John. We’ve had pretty good economic results for it. We’re in a challenge period now, I get that."
2020-03-10,24:18,Larry Kudlow,"So with respect to your question on the specifics… I think there will be a big growth pay off. I think it will help deal with whatever challenges occur in the next few months. I think beyond that, ameliorating the tax burden on the middle class, the so-called blue collar boom that I talk quite a bit about. That’s what this is aimed for. That’s really what the payroll tax is principally about. By lifting the burdens of those middle class folks, I think we’re going to get a big growth kicker."
2020-03-10,24:50,Larry Kudlow,"We’ve had a terrifically strong labor market, as you know. It may stall bit or not, I’m just speculating on the challenges on the health side. But I think over time, we’ll make it up with much better economic growth. And I will remind also that later on, way down the road, probably later this summer or early fall, we will unveil another package of tax cut and tax reform proposals. But yeah, it’s a bold proposal. And this is a bold President. I think it’s paid off."
2020-03-10,25:22,Unnamed (Reporter),"If you were to make it permanent, can you back bill from general revenue to make up for… I mean, in fiscal year ’21, Social Security, unemployment insurance and Medicare Part A revenues, are $1.23 trillion. Can you find that money somewhere else?"
2020-03-10,25:36,Larry Kudlow,"I’d just say, we’re not talking about Medicare at this point. By the way, the answer’s yes, you can back bill it. That has been done before, because we’ve had other payroll tax cuts, and you mentioned one of them in 2010 or 2011. So the answer to that is yes. And the answer is, we will always maintain a solvent Social Security system."
2020-03-10,25:58,Larry Kudlow,"But you know, tax reform is very important. Economic growth is very important. Incentives for middle and lower income workers are very important. And I would just add, in terms of the boldness of this president’s policies, despite what some of our critics think, actually, it’s the middle and lower middle people that have done the best in wage growth terms. And I think this is absolutely consistent. This lifts tax burdens on the middle class. I think it’s absolutely consistent with his earlier policies."
2020-03-10,26:32,Mike Pence,"Let me also say John, if I can, that the other piece of this is what the doctors have said to us. What the experts have said, is if you’re sick, if you have reason to suspect that you may have coronavirus, we want you to stay home. And the president’s absolutely adamant working with the Congress or using his executive authority to ensure that hourly workers, people working for small or medium sized businesses that don’t currently have paid family leave, will be able to stay home and be confident that they’re not losing a paycheck. I think every American can identify with that concern."
2020-03-10,27:09,Mike Pence,"We are going to work forward. Whether we do it legislatively or the President has some resources in his executive authority to act, we’re going to work to make sure that hourly workers don’t feel like you have to go to work sick because you’re risking a paycheck. Get home, stay home. Take those couple of weeks to get better. Eamon."
2020-03-10,27:32,Unnamed (Reporter),"Thank you Mr. Vice President. I want to drill down on something that Larry just said, though. Because in 2018, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, federal payroll taxes generated $1.17 trillion, which is an enormous figure. Larry, you’re suggesting that you can make that up from general revenue. Where are you going to get $1 trillion from?"
2020-03-10,27:51,Larry Kudlow,"You know, let us put the proposal out in concrete details and flesh that out, and we’ll have much better answers. Right now, I want to stay in my lane. I think the health story, the coronavirus story, is very, very important here. We will do the best we can, Eamon, to give you the specific plans and details once we’ve fleshed them out."
2020-03-10,28:12,Unnamed (Reporter),Mr. Vice President. Mr. Vice President.
2020-03-10,28:13,Mike Pence,"Yes, please."
2020-03-10,28:16,Unnamed (Reporter),"What about the increased testing capacity? We’re still seeing reports of severe rationing in many cases because of the limited supply. It appears to be close to impossible for average Americans to get tested without being hospitalized first. So when can the American people expect to see these test kits available at doctors’ offices, at urgent care, admitting clinics, that sort of thing. Specifically, planning."
2020-03-10,28:36,Mike Pence,"Well, I’m going to have the Secretary step forward and address that. But let me say, we’ve made great progress over the last week. A million tests are in the field. Every state lab in America can do coronavirus tests. If you’re concerned that you have coronavirus, your doctor can contact the state lab, can have a test processed. By the end of this week, another four million tests will be distributed."
2020-03-10,29:02,Mike Pence,"But to your very important question, we’re working day by day with the largest commercial labs in America. We had some good discussions today with outside experts as well, who said that when the President brought the commercial labs in, he did exactly the right thing. Because it’s those big companies that have logistics infrastructure all over the country, have labs all over the country, that can distribute the tests, process the tests. Whether it’s Quest or whether it’s LabCorp. We believe that in the days and weeks ahead, we’re going to continue to see the availability of tests dramatically rise, and we’re driving toward that every day. Mr. Secretary, did you want to add to that?"
2020-03-10,29:43,Alex Azar,"Sure. Maybe Dr. Redfield can add in also. So by the end of this weekend, we had 1.1 million tests that were actually shipped. We have another one million that are either in transit or waiting for orders. So we actually have a surplus capacity already of tests that had been produced. And as the vice president said, by the end of this week, there will be another four million tests. So the tests are out there. The tests are in every public health lab in the country. They’re in hospitals, they’re in labs."
2020-03-10,30:13,Alex Azar,"But I think there’s a false premise in your question, which is the notion that just because I as a person say, “Oh, I’d like to be tested for the novel coronavirus.” I should be going to a minute clinic or some other facility, and just walking in saying, “Give me my test, please.” That’s not how diagnostic testing works in the United States or frankly, almost anywhere in the world."
2020-03-10,30:34,Unnamed (Reporter),"President Trump said on Friday, that anyone who wants to get tested can get tested."
2020-03-10,30:38,Alex Azar,"We’ve always been clear. If their doctor or public health physician believes they should be tested. It needs to always be clinically indicated to receive a test. So it’s a false premise. Go to your doctor if you… First, actually, don’t go to your doctor. Call your doctor’s office if you believe you may have the novel coronavirus. Call the clinic, call the hospital. Call the doctor’s office so that you don’t just walk right in. Follow their infection control procedures for doing that. And then, they will decide working with you, whether a test is appropriate to be done."
2020-03-10,31:14,Alex Azar,"But there are millions of tests out there now, and as the vice president said, with Quest and LabCorp getting it at the doctor’s office, swabbing, their distribution and transport system… It’s going to be an even better closer to the patient experience as I promised, as I talked to you on Saturday when we met together."
2020-03-10,31:32,Mike Pence,"That’s very good. And to answer you, I’m going to ask Dr. Berks to speak to this too, because she’s just done a tremendous job bringing our commercial labs to bear on this. But to your other point, the President directed us to essentially change the criteria that CDC was giving labs around the country. We heard from governors around the country that people that were only mildly symptomatic were being told that they couldn’t be tested. We changed that. We changed that-"
2020-03-10,32:03,Mike Pence,"Were told that they couldn’t be tested. We changed that. We changed that description and so as the President said, anyone who, on a doctor’s order, wants to be tested can at a doctor’s indication be tested now. We’re working to fill that need and we’re making great progress every single day, but I wanted Dr. Birx to speak to it as well."
2020-03-10,32:21,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah. I just wanted to talk to you briefly about what happened in decreasing barriers. I’ve been a lab person, I’ve been a vaccine developer, I’ve been a doctor, I’ve been all those things, but I’ve never in my lifetime of government service have worked with the CDC in a way that every time the state or local government calls and says, I have this barrier, I need a modification to the regulations that has happened almost daily and the reason we have commercial labs willing to step in immediately is because the FDA has created that ability and posted on their website, I don’t know if you’ve been there, this unbelievable waiver system and the clear definitions there. Every single hospital, every single University can utilize this testing algorithm. And that’s highly unusual, but it’s also what’s bringing the super large high throughput companies to the table. And this has been unique for me to be able to see this unbelievable dialogue between what states need, what local governments need and federal government being responsive with changing those regulations. And that has been really wonderful to watch."
2020-03-10,33:38,Mike Pence,"Thank you Dr. Birx. Can I get you, right here."
2020-03-10,33:41,Unnamed,"Yes. I wanted to ask, I guess the administration has really touted the success of the travel ban on China and Iran. Why has it not extended those bans to South Korea or Japan or Italy? And is it still under consideration or has the administration really shifted to mitigation from containment?"
2020-03-10,34:01,Mike Pence,"Well, I’m going to let Dr. Birx speak to that in a moment, but there is no question, as Dr. Fauci said just a few days ago, we would be in a very different place if President Trump had not suspended all travel from China. And we would also, I suspect, be in a very different place if we hadn’t issued travel advisories for portions of Italy, or portions of South Korea and initiated a screening of all passengers on all direct flights into the United States from both of those countries. I will tell you, we had a very thorough discussion today, the prospect of recommending to the President additional travel advisories. What we’re doing particularly, as Dr. Fauci said, is we’re following the facts and we’re going to bring those recommendations forward in the time and manner that we as the White House Coronavirus Task Force determine are appropriate, but let me tell you, it is literally a day to day consideration and we’re going to continue to put the health and safety of America first. Dr. Birx, did you want to amplify that?"
2020-03-10,35:18,Dr. Deborah Birx,I think that was perfectly said.
2020-03-10,35:19,Mike Pence,How about you?
2020-03-10,35:25,Unnamed,"Thank you. Tom Bossert, who used to be a part of this administration had an op ed where he basically said that the U.S. has 10 days before hospitals could be overrun. He recommended that schools be shut down for maybe eight weeks? What does the administration think about that? Does it agree that the U.S. could be at the point where there could be a turning point in the next 10 days or so? And what about keeping schools open? Should they be kept open?"
2020-03-10,35:56,Mike Pence,"Well, let me say the recommendations that you have and that every American now has @coronavirus.gov apply to every jurisdiction in the country, every state and every community, irrespective of whether or not there’s been a Coronavirus case established. I will tell you that we’re working very closely with California, Washington, New York, Florida, to develop community specific recommendations for those areas where we have had what is known as community spread, a number of Coronavirus cases that appear that it’s being transmitted in the community. In the next 24 hours, working with those states, we’ll be publishing CDCs recommendations for what ought to be done. But I want to turn it over to Dr. Fauci to tell you that we really think the most important thing here is that we continue to bring the facts forward to the American people and that our proposals and our recommendations, well, all of these apply to everybody in the United States and it’ll help reduce the infection rate of the Coronavirus that for those communities that are being impacted, we’re going to develop specific recommendations that’ll make the most sense for them. Dr Fauci."
2020-03-10,37:18,Unnamed,Thank you. Dr. Fauci can you wait until there’s community spread to make some of these decisions?
2020-03-10,37:27,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, it depends on the degree of community spread. I mean community spread could be just a small amount or you could start to see multiple generations, but getting to your individual question that everything is on the table for consideration. So, the idea that we’re not closing all, I mean I think for the country right now to say we’re going to close all the schools in the country, I don’t think would be appropriate. Would school closures be appropriate depending upon not whether you have already the horse is out of the barn, but when you start to see we’re getting a little bit danger here, so let’s do it."
2020-03-10,38:02,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So, it’s incorrect to say now everything has happened bad, let’s close the school and it’s incorrect to say let’s just blanket close the schools in the entire country tonight. I don’t think that that would be appropriate, but I do think it would be appropriate to carefully try and do things like closing, but there’s other things besides closing to do real mitigation sometime before you think you really need it. That gets back to what I said a few moments ago about where the puck is going to be, but you want to make sure you’re not so far ahead that you overshoot."
2020-03-10,38:35,Mike Pence,Great. Great. You.
2020-03-10,38:38,Unnamed,"Just real quick, should the President stop shaking hands with people? He just did it at the Medal of Freedom ceremony a few moments ago. On this sign up here it says you should stop handshaking if you’re at your workplace, in your school or in commercial establishments, should the President set that example? I notice you’ve been opting for the elbow bump. I’ve been shaking hands too. What do you make of that? Is that necessary do you think at this point?"
2020-03-10,39:04,Mike Pence,"Well, look, as the President has said in our line of work, you shake hands when someone wants to shake your hand and I expect the President will continue to do that. I’ll continue to do it. What this is is a broad recommendation for Americans, but a really good recommendation is to wash your hands often and all the experts tell me that while people want to get the various sanitizing lotions, washing your hands with hot soap and water for 20 seconds is just as good as any lotion you can buy."
2020-03-10,39:43,Mike Pence,"So, move on. You right there. How about one or two more."
2020-03-10,39:50,Unnamed,Is it a plan to coordinate a response with other countries?
2020-03-10,39:54,Mike Pence,I’m sorry. Say again.
2020-03-10,39:54,Unnamed,"Is it a plan to coordinate a response with other countries in the continent, President Trump met President from Brazil, Bolsonaro, this weekend. Did they talk about Coronavirus?"
2020-03-10,40:04,Mike Pence,"I know that they spoke about a broad range of issues and I’m confident the Coronavirus was discussed. What I can tell you is that our focus is on the health and wellbeing of the American people. We’re going to continue to communicate with nations across this hemisphere and across the country, but what the President’s given us as a mission of the White House Coronavirus task force is to see to the health and wellbeing of the American people and we’ll continue to make recommendations to do just that. How about one more."
2020-03-10,40:42,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. Vice President.
2020-03-10,40:44,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, two questions. One on Washington state, they made a request of the strategic stockpile for, I think it said 233,000 masks and they received half of that. I’m wondering if that report is inaccurate, please speak to it. And secondly, on cruise lines, are you looking at a bailout from cruise lines? Several of these companies are tax exempt."
2020-03-10,41:11,Unnamed,Larry’s waving you off.
2020-03-10,41:11,Alex Azar,"So, they got half of the shipment from the strategic national stockpile initially and then when the Vice President actually went out to the state of Washington, that’s when the second half of the shipment arrived. But I have spoken directly with Governor Inslee with whom we’ve had a superb working relationship and he has informed me that there are some additional personal protective equipment needs that a couple of their hospitals have and we’re working through the strategic national stockpile to make sure we are directing and fulfilling shipments to them as needed."
2020-03-10,41:40,Mike Pence,"All right. I want to echo again, our gratitude to Governor Inslee and all the health officials in the state of Washington. I was there last week, our teams are working very closely together. We’ll follow up on that public report that the secretary has indicated. But look, as I said, in the next 24 hours, we will be working with not only Washington state, California with New York, with Florida, and unveiling our recommendations, CDCs recommendations to those areas that have been impacted by a community spread. And then we’ll continue to come alongside those communities to do everything in our power to mitigate the spread. But let me just say again, as a resource, thank you all, we’ll be back here again tomorrow. Coronavirus.gov practical information for every American, details for state labs that may yet have questions about performing their own tests. We have specifics, enzymes, agents, ingredients that where they can be acquired and how for the performance of Coronavirus tests. But for every American, I just want to say again, remember the risks to the average American of contracting, the Coronavirus remains low…"
2020-03-10,42:56,Unnamed,How do we know that?
2020-03-10,42:56,Mike Pence,"But however, the risk to senior citizens with serious underlying chronic health conditions is very significant and it’s important for all of us to continue to take all the steps necessary to look after the most vulnerable, to look after our health and I’m confident that we’ll get through this together."
2020-03-10,43:20,Unnamed,"Will we ever have drive through testing like in Korea? Dr. Fauci, will we have drive through testing like in Korea?"
2020-03-14,00:19,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We just completed a very good meeting of the Coronavirus Task Force and they’re really doing a great job, our professionals. The results are very, very good and when you compare this to what’s happening around the world, we’re very proud of our people. There’s been a tremendous amount of coordination with states, with cities, and they’re a little smaller form of government and they have things going well, they’re coordinating with us. And certain in particular, I think California has been terrific. The relationship, New York has been really good. We’ve had some really good relationships in terms of, especially the hotspots and we’re focused on those hotspots. Some areas we don’t have no problem whatsoever and we hope to keep it that way."
2020-03-14,01:25,Donald Trump,"Before I turned this over to our great Vice President to provide an update, I just want to express my appreciation for the hard work done by the people behind me and the people back in the various offices, including the fact that I just left the Oval Office, so we have some people there that are probably watching this or they’re just working. We’re using the full power of the federal government to defeat the virus and that’s what we’ve been doing. Last week we secured an initial 8.3 billion from Congress for the coronavirus and that was quickly done and very efficiently done. I want to thank all members of Congress. Yesterday I declared a national emergency, which was a very big deal because it opened up avenues that we would never be able to open up without it and it will make more than $50 billion available to us immediately and disaster relief funds and that’s available for states, territories and local governments, so that was really good."
2020-03-14,02:34,Donald Trump,"We also reached an agreement yesterday on a new legislative package that will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus, so it was done very, very bipartisan. It was very nice to see it, probably the cooperation. I want to thank Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, who did a fantastic job and worked with Nancy Pelosi and their representatives and it was really great, it worked out very well. And a lot of people are benefiting by a lot of provisions in the bill, which they’re going to be discussing with you today and the tremendous provisions. So that’s something that we should talk about. I was honored to see that the stock market, you were mostly there with us, set a record in a short period of time, over a 45 minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the Rose Garden. That was a record, all time record. I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. How about five times a day? We’ll do one five times a day."
2020-03-14,03:44,Donald Trump,"But that was something to watch and I had no idea. We walked back. I said, “So how did that work out?” They said, “Sir, you just set a new record and the history of the stock market.” So that was pretty good. And those great companies that were there, they couldn’t have been too unhappy either when you think about it, because they’re all very big publicly listed companies, so they did a good job. And more importantly, they’re going to do a good job. When you look at a CVS and Walmart and all of the tremendous people that were there yesterday, these are the biggest and the best and they’re opening up their facilities, they are opening up. They’re right now, literally working right now, on doing something that’s never been done before to the extent that we’re doing it and so we’re very proud of them."
2020-03-14,04:30,Donald Trump,"Also, the bill provides for free coronavirus testing for all Americans who should be tested. So people that are getting tested are getting this free, they don’t have to pay. A lot of people said, “Gee, it’s a lot of money.” And it is, it’s a pretty complex test actually, and it costs money and it’s being provided free, so people don’t have to worry about that. It also provides paid sick and family medical leave for those who need it, including for those who have the virus, for caregivers and those looking after children affected by school closures. So that’s all taken care of also. And we’ll continue all of these different actions, we have other things planned. We’re going to also be working with companies that are affected financially. Our country is in the best financial shape, so different then in the past, over the years if you look at some of the real big crises we had. It was financial problems and different things."
2020-03-14,05:35,Donald Trump,"We now are in very, very strong financial shape with all of the trade and all of the other things that we’ve been doing. It’s been pretty amazing. We hope the Federal Reserve will finally get on board and do what they should do because we’re doing things that they should be doing frankly. And we can all do them together, but they should be much more proactive. Other boards and another countries and people representing those countries are taking a much more aggressive action than our fed and for the most part. So we’d like to see the… If you look at central banks yesterday, what they did, we want to see our federal reserve be much more proactive. It’s important. But in the meantime we’re doing things that have been really well received. And I guess you saw that yesterday, at the end of the day, with what we’ve done. We have a lot of things to tell you in terms of respirators, in terms of all of the different things or the masks are being made by the millions, millions and millions. We have plenty now, but we’re ordering for the millions. We’re ordering worst case scenario, we always say worst case scenario and that’s where we’re going. So I just want to thank everybody. I think the press has been really, over the last 24 hours, I think the representation’s really been very fair, for the most part been very fair. We’re all in this together. It’s something that nobody expected. It came out of China and it’s one of those things that happened, it’s nobody’s fault. We all will solve this problem. We’ll solve it well. I think the American people have been incredible in the way they’ve acted."
2020-03-14,07:21,Donald Trump,"And if you look at companies and sports leagues and all of the things, what they’ve done is just something very special without being told, necessarily. In some cases perhaps they were told actually, but for the most part they want to get it over with. They want to get it over with quickly and with very little death. As of this moment we have 50 deaths, which is a lot of good decisions were made or that number could be many times that but that’s based on a lot of good decisions. One or two in particular, you know that Europe was declared the hotspot yesterday, a big hotspot, number one and we made a decision quite a bit prior to that but we saw what was happening. But if you have any questions, this group will be very happy to do it."
2020-03-14,08:12,Donald Trump,"But I just want to say they have been led by Mike Pence. They have been incredible, the job they’re doing. They’re working 20 hours a day. This man is working 20 hours a day or maybe more? Is it more? I think it’s more. Tony has been working, I’m just looking at this whole group and we’ve created a number of new stars, including the gentleman right behind me. I watched him the other day, it was such a fantastic job you did and I really appreciate it. But they’re going to be answering questions and we have a lot of new information, so I think you’ll find it very interesting and I’ll be going back to the Oval Office."
2020-03-14,08:50,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:08:54]. Mr. President, there are so many people right now that are rushing to Costco, they’re rushing to grocery stores all over the country, they’re filling up their baskets. Is that the right move? Do you think that people should actually be saying, “Maybe conserve as opposed to to buy?” Also overnight Apple Sir, they announced that they’re going to be closing all their stores for two weeks. Do you want to see other retail outlets or restaurants, stuff like that, do the same thing for-"
2020-03-14,09:14,Donald Trump,"I think it’s fine if they do it. I think it’s frankly, it’s good if they do it. I think what Apple did is fine and want to keep people away for a little while, just keep them away."
2020-03-14,09:23,Unnamed,Well at Costco-
2020-03-14,09:25,Donald Trump,"And when it gets better… Well, people are going and buying things and I understand that. By the way, I had my temperature taken coming into the room."
2020-03-14,09:32,Unnamed,So did we.
2020-03-14,09:33,Donald Trump,You did good?
2020-03-14,09:34,Unnamed,Yes sir.
2020-03-14,09:36,Donald Trump,Let’s compare. Do you want to compare?
2020-03-14,09:36,Unnamed,"We did all of that, yeah."
2020-03-14,09:38,Donald Trump,Good. Well that means we’re all looking good. I also took the test last night-
2020-03-14,09:44,Unnamed,You did take the test?
2020-03-14,09:44,Unnamed,You did take the test?
2020-03-14,09:45,Donald Trump,"And I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday, people were asking, “Did I take the test?”"
2020-03-14,09:49,Unnamed,When will we have the result Mr. President?
2020-03-14,09:50,Donald Trump,"I don’t know, whatever it takes. A day or two days, whatever it is. They send it to a lab-"
2020-03-14,09:55,Unnamed,Why did you take it.
2020-03-14,09:55,Donald Trump,… but I did take it.
2020-03-14,09:56,Unnamed,"Sir, you’ve been sending mixed messages-"
2020-03-14,09:57,Donald Trump,Only because the press-
2020-03-14,09:57,Unnamed,"Mr. President respectfully, you’ve been sending mixed messages. We watched as you shook hands with people yesterday. You have talked about 5 million tests being available, probably won’t need that many. Has your own sense of urgency evolved and are you changing what you’re doing?"
2020-03-14,10:12,Donald Trump,"No, I’ve been urgent. This is urgent for me right from the beginning. You know that because I closed up our country to China-"
2020-03-14,10:22,Unnamed,But why are you shaking hands Sir?
2020-03-14,10:22,Donald Trump,"Because it almost becomes a habit and you get out of that habit and frankly I was a non hand shaker for the most part. I’d never believe that shaking hands, once you become a politician, and I notice it too, political people walk up to me, they want to shake my hand. I said, “Well-” [crosstalk 00:10:39] Just wait a minute, just take it nice and easy, okay? Just relax. People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out. It’s sort of a natural reflex and we’re all getting out of it. All of us have that problem. Somebody comes up to you, they put their hand out you probably tend to just shake it and we’re all getting out of that. Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I agree. But people will put their hand out, sometimes I’ll put the hand out. You don’t think about it. People are thinking about it more and more. We have to think about it. It’s important."
2020-03-14,11:10,Donald Trump,"Somebody said yesterday, I touched the microphone. I was touching it because we have different height people and I’m trying to make it easy for them because they’re going to have to touch, because they wouldn’t be able to reach the mic. They wouldn’t be able to speak in the mic. So I’ll move the mic down and they said, “Oh, he touched the microphone.” Well if I don’t touch it, they’re going to have to touch it. Somebody’s going to have to, so I might as well be the one to do it. But no, we all have to get away from… I mean getting away from shaking hands is a good thing and possibly that’s something that comes out of this. Maybe people shouldn’t be shaking hands for the longterm because it does transmit flu and other things. We have flu in our country that kills on average 36,000 people a year, 36,000 people and that’s something that we’re not talking about. But as of this moment, we’ve lost 50, possibly a little bit less than 50 but probably 50 people. And we’re going to try and keep that number as low as possible."
2020-03-14,12:07,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:12:07] The Pentagon is telling the service members and their families not to travel domestically. Should all Americans follow that same advice?
2020-03-14,12:16,Donald Trump,"Well, if you don’t have to travel, I wouldn’t do it. If you don’t have to travel… We want this thing to end. We don’t want a lot of people getting infected. We wanted to end and end as quickly as possible. So far I think we’ve done a fantastic job. I really think that the people behind me have not been given the credit that they deserve, because they have done a fantastic job. When you see all these school closures, when you see… The school closures are very important, but it causes a lot of problems. The bill that we signed yesterday takes care of a lot of those problems, with children staying at home and the parents are working. Now we take care of that issue, with what we passed last night. Now it has to go through the Senate, I have to sign it, but that will happen. But I’m now going back to the White House. You have great professionals and if there’s anything that comes up-"
2020-03-14,13:02,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:13:02] Thank you Mr. president. I just wanted to follow up on that. Are you considering other travel restrictions, perhaps domestically-"
2020-03-14,13:16,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-14,13:16,Unnamed,… in that regards? Can you describe what type of-
2020-03-14,13:18,Donald Trump,"Specifically from certain areas, yes we are. And we’re working with the states and we are considering other restrictions, yes."
2020-03-14,13:28,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:13:28] Reuters is reporting that you’re going to extend the European travel ban to the UK and Ireland on Monday, is that accurate?"
2020-03-14,13:33,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at it very seriously, yeah. Because they’ve had a little bit of activity unfortunately, so we’re going to be looking at that. We actually already have looked at it and that is going to be announced."
2020-03-14,13:48,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:13:48] You just criticize the fed yet again, if I could just give a little clarity on your thinking on this. It’s been a hallmark of your presidency, you’re always going after the fed. If you feel so strongly about it, why don’t you dismiss the chairman or do you think your power was to do so?"
2020-03-14,14:04,Donald Trump,"No, I think I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman. He is, so far, made a lot of bad decisions in my opinion. We had this great and we will soon have again, because I think you’re going to have a tremendous bounce when this is over. I think there’s a pent up bounce that’s going to be tremendous. I think you saw that yesterday with the stock market. Now I’m not happy with the fed, because I think that they are following, not leading. We should be leading. I’m not happy because if you look at other central banks, largely they’re lower than us, their rate and their equivalent of the fed rate is lower, in some cases by two points. In some cases, that’s a lot, in some cases very substantially. And I thought that the fed would be and should be much more proactive as opposed to following our fed is following."
2020-03-14,14:54,Donald Trump,"We have the number one currency in the world by a factor of many times. As you know, we have the currency, we have the power, we have by far the strong currency also, you look at the dollar, the strength of the dollar. Our fed is not doing what they should be doing. We shouldn’t have a fed rate that’s higher than our competitor nations. You look at Germany, they’re essentially under zero, they’re negative. There are many countries negative. Japan is negative, Germany is negative, others are negative and we’re paying higher interest rates. And what I’d like to do is frankly refinance our debt. We could refinance our debt very easily at a much lower rate. We have some tremendous opportunities right now, but Jerome Powell is not making it easy. No, I have the right to remove, I’m not doing that. [crosstalk 00:15:38] No, I’m not doing that. I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge and I haven’t made any decisions on that."
2020-03-14,15:50,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:15:50] What’s your temperature Mr. President? Was your temperature normal Mr. President?
2020-03-14,15:59,Donald Trump,Totally normal. [crosstalk 00:16:03].
2020-03-14,16:00,Unnamed,Hello Mr. Vice President.
2020-03-14,16:10,Mike Pence,"Well, good afternoon everyone. As the President just said, we just completed the White House Coronavirus Task Force meeting in the situation room. And we continue to implement the President’s vision, not just for a whole of government response to the coronavirus, but a whole of America approach. The focus of our task force today and going forward is on implementing the President’s public and private partnership, on testing, focusing on ensuring that state and local authorities have the guidance and the support to ensure mitigation, particularly in areas where we’ve seen community spread. And we’re continuing to lean in at the President’s direction, on addressing capacity issues in our hospitals and with regard to equipment. Let me reiterate the President’s gratitude, not just for the team behind me and the team behind them, all of our federal agencies that are literally working every day to bring a whole of government approach to this but we also want to commend all of the governors across the country."
2020-03-14,17:24,Mike Pence,"I’ll be speaking again to all the governors, all 50 States and the territories tomorrow. But as the President said yesterday in the Rose garden, we couldn’t be more grateful for all of the governors, particularly in areas where we’ve had community spread, for the seamless cooperation that’s taking place. And we commend local health authorities and all of those who are literally on the front lines. Also grateful all the businesses that you saw in high relief yesterday, businesses around the country in sports and entertainment, in retail that are making decisions based on CDC guidelines and good common sense to protect the American people. And lastly, as the President also said, we just want to thank the American people for listening to local authorities, listening to recommendations from the CDC. We’ll hear more about that in just a moment from Dr. Fauci and Dr. Burks."
2020-03-14,18:22,Mike Pence,"But as we’re seeing, not surprisingly, as we’ve seen in the past, the American people are all responding to look after not only their own health, but their families and their communities. And one story after another is truly inspiring, to the President and to all of us. As you know, it’s been a brisk few days. The President declared a national emergency yesterday, freeing up a significant federal resources, for state and local authorities as well as our national response. The president announced that unprecedented public and private partnership on testing, and let me say that at 5:00 tomorrow we will be detailing the progress that our team is making. I can tell you they are literally working around the clock with private companies."
2020-03-14,19:11,Mike Pence,"We are very pleased that Thermo Fisher was just approved last night by the FDA in record time, to also be providing what’s called a high throughput test, that will actually increase the capacity of this public and private partnership. But again, details on that in terms of when the local sites will be available at CVS and Walgreens and Walmart and other locations, what communities those will initially be available in, when the website will go online, as well as how this will continue to roll out, 5:00 PM tomorrow Eastern Standard Time, we’ll detail that. Last night the House of Representatives passed legislation which addressed the priorities that President Trump had laid out for the American people in the weeks before that. I want to join President Trump, in thanking a Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, the Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives, who as the President said earlier today, pulled together, pulled together to pass legislation that’s meeting this moment in the bipartisan health first spirit that the American people would expect."
2020-03-14,20:27,Mike Pence,"The Secretary of the Treasury will detail the legislation, but to be clear, the deal that passed the house last night, will head to the Senate early next week, delivers on the President’s plan for strong health and economic support. Particularly focused on those most impacted, including hardworking blue collar Americans, who may not currently have paid family leave today. It provides free coronavirus testing for uninsured Americans and it builds on the decisions that President Trump made, expanding coverage for Medicare, Medicaid and also getting a commitment from private health insurance companies to join with us, to waive all copays on coronavirus testing. So now testing will be free for every American. Those who have insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, other programs and even the uninsured."
2020-03-14,21:24,Mike Pence,"The legislation also establishes tax credits that the Secretary of the Treasury will describe, that’ll provide paid sick and family medical leave for coronavirus related employment interruptions. I expect Dr. Burks and Dr. Fauci will reiterate this, if you are sick, now you need not be concerned. If you’re an hourly wage earner in America, you need not be concerned about staying home. If you’re sick, stay home. You’re not going to miss a paycheck because of this legislation that’s moving through the Congress. We’ll make sure that your employer, including small businesses, have the ability to provide paid leave to you…"
2020-03-14,22:03,Mike Pence,"Businesses have the ability to provide paid leave to you. This also provides funding and flexibility to ensure that senior citizens, women, children and low income families have access to emergency nutritional assistance and it incentivizes states to ease access to employment benefits. Again, the President and I are profoundly grateful for the bipartisan spirit that drove this legislation and let me also say how grateful we are for the Secretary of the Treasury and the long hours that he put in negotiating this measure."
2020-03-14,22:33,Mike Pence,"Let me say also last night at midnight the Department of Homeland Security implemented the President’s decision to suspend all travel from Europe passing through 13 airports, as Acting Secretary Wolf will detail the implementation of that. To be clear, countries where we have suspended travel under section 212F, Americans may still return to the United States. Legal residents may still return. They are being screened at some 13 airports as we speak."
2020-03-14,23:07,Mike Pence,"If they are identified as being symptomatic for any illness, there is additional response on site, but those Americans are being encouraged to return home and self quarantine for 14 days. That started at midnight last night and Secretary will detail it. In a few moments I’ll ask Dr Fauci to update us on cases as well as current CDC guidance for all Americans."
2020-03-14,23:35,Mike Pence,And all of you are already aware that this week we issued specific guidance to about a half a dozen states where we’ve seen community spread. Dr Burts will touch briefly on the Public-Private Partnership Testing Plan and also speak about what the data is showing at this moment about the best guidance for every American.
2020-03-14,23:58,Mike Pence,"Acting Secretary Wolf and I both want to join the President and commending the cruise line industry and they made a decision yesterday, 85% of all the domestic cruise lines announced that they would be suspending cruise line operations for a period of 30 days and Chad Wolf will explain to you the importance of that decision."
2020-03-14,24:23,Mike Pence,"We want to commend the cruise line industry for working with us. And as we met last week on this day with cruise line industry executives, we’re going to be working very vigorously over the next 30 days to implement new policies that’ll ensure that when the cruise lines start back up, there’ll be safer and healthier places than ever before. But a great industry. American people love it and enjoy it and we’re going to make sure that it’s there for many, many years to come."
2020-03-14,24:50,Mike Pence,"Also, as the President just foreshadowed in our task force meeting today, the President has made a decision to suspend all travel to the United Kingdom and Ireland effective midnight Monday night Eastern Standard Time. Chad Wolf will describe the details of that. But again, as the President just suggested, all of our health experts presented information. Dr Fauci will reflect on some of those numbers. Made a unanimous recommendation to the President that we suspend all travel from the UK and Ireland."
2020-03-14,25:22,Mike Pence,"That will be effective midnight Monday night Eastern Standard Time. Again, Americans in the UK or Ireland can come home. Legal residents can come home, but as the Secretary will detail, they will be funneled through specific airports and process. We continue to emphasize that the risk of serious illness for the average American remains low, but the data shows that seniors with serious underlying health conditions are our most vulnerable population, the people most susceptible to serious medical outcomes."
2020-03-14,25:56,Mike Pence,"Seema Verma, in a few moments, will talk about the President’s decision yesterday to restrict all visitors in all nursing homes around the country and other measures that we have taken. But it’s so important, so important for all of us, all of us who are blessed with having senior citizens in our family, like my 88 year old mom, let’s look after seniors with serious underlying health conditions and make sure that every American around them is practicing the best kind of hygiene, the best kind of measures to ensure that they’re not exposed. We’ll hear also from a Dr. Carson and the Surgeon General before we wrap up and take some questions. With that, let me recognize Dr. Tony Fauci for an update on where we stand and recommendations and guidance."
2020-03-14,26:46,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Just a quick review of the numbers as of late afternoon yesterday, let me start off quickly globally and then we’ll go to the United States. Right now there are 129 countries that have involvement with coronavirus globally. The numbers are 132 plus thousand so it’s a little bit more than 132,000, about 7,500 of which are new cases."
2020-03-14,27:10,Donald Trump,"Importantly, and this is something we’ve mentioned over the last couple of days, that if you look at what was formally the main feeder of this coronavirus outbreak was China. They have 80,000 or 81,000 new cases, but only 11 new cases and only seven new deaths. Things have switched over now to outside of China, which has actually triggered our decision, the decision of the President to do the travel restrictions in other areas besides China. And I think it’s important to recognize that because when this is all over and it will end, you will see a curve of how the coronavirus outbreak evolved."
2020-03-14,27:50,Donald Trump,"It’s not going to be a uni dimensional or homogeneous because countries are going to do this and then that. We’ve it already with China, we’re starting to see it with Korea, which brings us now to what we can expect in our own country. If you look at the domestic cases, there are about 2,226 including the repatriations, 50 deaths, 532 new cases and nine new deaths, which means we have not reached our peak."
2020-03-14,28:20,Donald Trump,"Now, we will see more cases and we will see more suffering and death predominantly as the Vice President said among the vulnerables in our society, the individuals with the conditions that we spoke to and the elderly, but built in that is a challenge. And the challenge is we still have the opportunity to influence the course of that curve. What we would like to see is that when this is all over all curve was not like that."
2020-03-14,28:48,Donald Trump,"Our curve was like this, so that’s the reason why we’re implementing the things we’re talking about. And finally I just want to make a comment about yesterday, as a physician, which is what I primarily am, who takes care of patients every day before I was doing this is that there are things that happened yesterday that I think are going to be really important to the people out there who are going to be impacted by this, but particularly by the physicians and that is the President declaring a state of national emergency because that will be what I thought the word that I use essentially unshackling us from any of the things that are going to get in the way of our implemented."
2020-03-14,29:26,Donald Trump,"Particularly the new powers giving to the Secretary of HHS, Alex Azar, and the departments within his agency, particularly CMS, which you’re going to hear about shortly. And within that group, particularly the nursing home situation, which we’ve really got to protect. The other thing is we always get asked about testing. You saw the CDO out there, now it’s all systems go, let’s look forward."
2020-03-14,29:50,Donald Trump,"The responsibility is going to be with us but also with them because as we get knowledge about new testing will alleviate the anxiety that we have in the world about we don’t know what’s going on, but it also will give the individual physician and individual citizen the opportunity to know where they stand. I’ll stop there and happy to answer questions later. Thank you."
2020-03-14,30:12,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-14,30:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. Good afternoon. I just completed my second week. I want to just start with the four things that I have learned in the last two weeks. One, we’re at our best when the country comes together in a bipartisan way and that has really been extraordinary to witness. But secondly, what you may not have seen as much of is the willingness of state and local governments to work together with the federal government in a seamless way, independent of party affiliation."
2020-03-14,30:42,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The third thing has been the remarkable decrease in bureaucracy and red tape in order to get us to where we are today. This is particularly evident in the CDC. And then finally the understanding that in order to unleash and serve every American, we have to create public- private partnerships that bring together the extraordinary strength of our private sector."
2020-03-14,31:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"When we saw issues with testing, and again I want to remind everyone, it was a surveillance system that was set up by public health institutions in the United States, our CDC, to be a surveillance test. We then, because there was no other moved it to a diagnostic tests, but now we have the full power of our testing capacity. What do I mean by that? We’re looking at what it will take to have consumer access and that’s what the private sector is bringing to us."
2020-03-14,31:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Secondly, we had to have automated high throughput testing because we want the American people to be able to get their results quickly. And you’ve heard from Roche and Thermo Fisher that access. But finally we want to make sure that patients get results. And that was what was critical in that bill yesterday on reporting and requiring reporting because obviously as we decentralize, as we move out of state and local laboratories, public health laboratories, as we move out into the hospitals in the communities, we need to know about the test results so that we can focus resources where they’re needed the most."
2020-03-14,32:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally I want to conclude with something that’s very important. When you are tested and our results look very similar to South Korea now to date where South Korea, 96 plus percent of people with symptoms were negative. That means also that they had respiratory symptoms. Let’s remind all of us, most respiratory diseases are contagious."
2020-03-14,32:33,Dr. Deborah Birx,"If you have any respiratory symptoms, you want to protect yourself and treat yourself, but you also want to protect others. And so let’s everyone assume when they have a respiratory illness that you have a contagious illness because if it isn’t allergies, it’s contagious. And let’s use those precautions across the board. And let’s, when you get a negative test that means you’re negative that day. That doesn’t mean that you couldn’t get the virus spreading overnight because it replicates in your nose, in your nasal secretions and you would have a positive test tomorrow."
2020-03-14,33:08,Dr. Deborah Birx,"If you have a negative test, that doesn’t mean that you can discontinue precautions. It doesn’t mean you can start taking risks because you were negative. Let’s ensure that if you had symptoms, you are contagious. Let’s treat yourself as being contagious. And if you have a negative test, let’s make sure that you’re still protecting others from whatever you do have and it doesn’t reassure you personally and you take additional risk."
2020-03-14,33:35,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, I just wanted to conclude with a group of clients and patients that we are all very worried about. These are individuals that we call long-term survivors from HIV. They’re here across the country that have survived more than four decades with HIV. Many of them still carry a level of immunocompromise. To all of them out there, please take care of yourself. Please ensure that you’re doing everything possible to ensure you don’t get exposed. Thank you."
2020-03-14,34:00,Mike Pence,"Thank you. Great comments. Mr. Secretary, on the legislation that passed the house."
2020-03-14,34:06,Steve Mnuchin,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. First in particular I want to thank Kevin McCarthy and Kevin Brady and all the Republicans on the house side who worked with us round the clock. I’d also like to thank Mitch McConnell and his team who were providing us input as well. I especially want to thank Speaker Pelosi who was literally available to us round the clock for the last three days and also want to just thank the Vice President and the President who were very specifically involved in the details with us and providing guidance."
2020-03-14,34:39,Steve Mnuchin,"I will just highlight some of the issues here. The first thing I would just say is this delivers on what the President announced in his speech the other night. Obviously people who need to be quarantined and people who have the virus, we want them at home and we want them to continue to get paid. We don’t want to be in a situation where they fear not getting paid during this two week period of time."
2020-03-14,35:06,Steve Mnuchin,The first thing that this does is it creates a very seamless process for people that work for small and medium sized businesses. They will continue to get paid by their employer. They don’t have to worry about big government and coming to big government to get their checks. They will continue to get paid.
2020-03-14,35:23,Steve Mnuchin,"We were also very sensitive to small and medium sized businesses. Many of these businesses covered sick pay, but they’re going to have many more people that may be on quarantine, the normal sick pay, and we didn’t want them to have to bear the cost. 100% of the cost for these limited situations will be taken care of by the federal government. And then finally we wanted to think of, again, as I said, how do we deliver money to the people in the quickest way?"
2020-03-14,35:51,Steve Mnuchin,"We didn’t want to take six months to implement some government system, so I want to thank everybody at the IRS. The way we’re able to do this again, the IRS will issue tax credits for most employers, they’ll just deduct the money from what they owe us. But I want to emphasize for small and medium sized businesses that have cashflow problems, we will issue guidelines. You’ll be able to come to the IRS, get the money in advance so you don’t have cashflow issues."
2020-03-14,36:18,Steve Mnuchin,"We were very careful in balancing, making sure that people got paid with not creating undue burden. We also will have unique circumstances where schools are closed. In many places, parents may be able to telecommute and take care of their kids and continue to get paid for their companies, but in certain circumstances that parents have to be home to take care of youngsters or elderly people, again, we wanted to ensure that they had the ability to do that."
2020-03-14,36:47,Steve Mnuchin,"And as the Vice President mentioned for kids that receive meals in schools, the schools were closed. We wanted to make sure that those kids would continue to get lunches paid for. I especially want to thank the task force. Two things that were very important to us in this, there’s a provision as it relates to masks. We can now ramp up to 30 million masks a month and we wanted to make sure there was free testing, but there’s also a provision that the states will communicate back to CDC these results."
2020-03-14,37:16,Steve Mnuchin,We will very quickly get those results. Last thing I want to say is I thank the house for sticking around till very late last night at 12:30. I don’t want people to be surprised. We will be doing a technical correction on Monday morning despite us working very hard.
2020-03-14,37:33,Steve Mnuchin,"We had language agreed with the Speaker and with Kevin McCarthy, it didn’t get into the final bill. Last night at 12:30 Kevin, the Speaker and I agreed that they would vote on it and have an agreement. There’ll be a technical correction. I don’t want anybody to come back on Monday morning and be surprised by that. Again, thank you to the Vice President and the President. And let me also just say, I would describe this as like a baseball game. The first inning was the $8 billion. This is the second inning."
2020-03-14,38:02,Steve Mnuchin,"We have a lot more we need to do with Congress. And the Speaker and I have acknowledged it. We will be working starting immediately. The airlines industry in particular, no different than after 9/11 has a very unique circumstance. The cruise industry, the hotel industry. I would say we’ve got a lot more work to do and we very much appreciate the bipartisan support and anticipate rolling things out very quickly."
2020-03-14,38:29,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I know the President would want me to say again how grateful we are for all of your efforts on behalf of the American people. Acting Secretary Chad Wolf is going to speak about cruise lines, the current suspension of travel in the expansion to UK and Ireland, Mr. Secretary."
2020-03-14,38:48,Secretary Chad Wolf,"Thank you. Good afternoon and let me start off by thanking the partnerships that we have with our private sector partners, both in the airline industry and the cruise line industry for implementing a number of travel restrictions and security orders over the last several weeks and months. As the Vice President and the President have outlined, we have issued new directives denying foreign nationals who have been in certain effected countries, that’s been 28 countries to date, from entry into the US."
2020-03-14,39:15,Secretary Chad Wolf,"At the President’s request, and again, as the Vice President outlined earlier, we’ve had a number of major cruise lines that have agreed to suspend outbound trips for 30 days. We’ve had a number of smaller operators follow that suit and then we have also given orders to a very small handful to not sail. And that began at midnight last night as well. Today is the, again, as the Vice President outlined, the President made the decision due to the rising number of cases in the UK to apply these restrictions to both the UK and Ireland."
2020-03-14,39:47,Secretary Chad Wolf,"As we move forward, again, these restrictions bar travel for certain foreign nationals who have been present in the UK or Ireland in the past 14 days. And again, that goes effective midnight Monday. To be clear, the President’s proclamation in these travel restrictions do not apply to US citizens. I want to be very clear about that. And the Vice President mentioned that. Do not apply for US citizens."
2020-03-14,40:11,Secretary Chad Wolf,"I think we saw some reporting of how do US citizens get back from Europe quickly? They don’t need to. They will be allowed into the US. Legal permanent residents, family members under the age of 21, foreign diplomats, and then we have other exemptions that are outlined in the proclamation, can certainly travel back to the US. They will undergo some medical screening and some other questions when they arrive and then they will be asked to self quarantine for 14 days."
2020-03-14,40:38,Secretary Chad Wolf,"These restrictions to the UK and Ireland, just like the Shingon Zone in China and Iran do not apply to air, cargo, maritime, cargo, economic shipping or the like. Let me close again by saying the President has really taken unprecedented action to protect the safety and the security of the American public. These actions have never been taken before. Let me thank the Department of Homeland Security, the men and women of the department who are working day and night, 24 hours a day to implement these restrictions and to make sure that we do this in a very orderly and efficient process and we also continue to look at all measures on the table and new measures that we have to implement as we go forward as the virus continues to evolve. Thank you."
2020-03-14,41:24,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And I know the President would want me to reiterate your thanks and commendation to the dedicated men and women of DHS that are on the front lines of implementing these travel policies and doing an outstanding job. With that, I’m going to recognize Seema Verma, the Head of CMS to talk about our continued emphasis on seniors, in particularly the risk to seniors with serious underlying health conditions and the steps that we’re taking relative to nursing homes and inspections and guidance to protect those most vulnerable."
2020-03-14,42:05,Seema Verma,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. As the President and the Vice President said, we did take action last night to indicate that nursing homes should restrict all visitors effective immediately and that includes all non-essential personnel. There are some exceptions for end of life. We are also canceling all group activities and communal dining and there is active screening of healthcare workers that are in the facility."
2020-03-14,42:29,Seema Verma,"The emergency declaration, as Dr. Fauci said, is also very important to our healthcare workforce. There’s a lot more flexibility that they have. For example, they can have workers from across state lines, and doctors and nurses that can help them. Hospitals have the ability to move patients around, so that’s also going to be very helpful as they go forward with this."
2020-03-14,42:52,Seema Verma,"Also with the nursing homes, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago that we had a call to action for all healthcare facilities to double down around infection control practices. We have now come up with some very specific guidance for our surveyors and we have already begun the process of going into nursing homes, especially the ones that had a history of problems with infection control. And those inspections have already started. We’ve been doing those in Washington state and California, New York, but we’ll be increasing those over the coming weeks. Thank you."
2020-03-14,43:25,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Seema. And I’m mindful of the fact that there are likely many seniors in nursing homes around America that could be watching us at this hour. And let me just assure you that we’re going to continue to take steps to ensure that all the guidance from CMS, all the guidance from CDC about preventing the spread of infectious disease remains low. But, and the threat here, I want to be clear, as Dr. Fauci has said, I might just ask him to emphasize again, the threat here is not to seniors particularly or to seniors that may be on certain medications, but for seniors with-"
2020-03-14,44:03,Mike Pence,"Maybe on certain medications, but for seniors with serious underlying health conditions, we’re taking the steps of suspending visitors for the purpose of protecting the most vulnerable, but to all of those other seniors that are watching from nursing homes or maybe watching from home or otherwise healthy. Dr Fouche, maybe you’d give them a word."
2020-03-14,44:20,Donald Trump,"Yeah, sure. I think that I mean obviously when you’re a senior individual like myself, that my degree of protecting against infections is not as good as it was when you’re 30. But if you’re an otherwise healthy senior, that the things that you really have less of a risk than if you have an underlying condition. Thank you."
2020-03-14,44:37,Mike Pence,Thank you Doctor. Thank you. Couple more updates for you. I want to hear from the Surgeon General and Dr. Carson and then we’ll go to as many questions as you have. Okay. Mr. Surgeon General.
2020-03-14,44:52,Jerome Adams,"Thank you. Yesterday was a very big, a very important day for our nation’s providers and for our nation’s patients in terms of the emergency declaration and also in terms of the agreement with the House that Secretary Mnuchin negotiated. And I want you all to understand some straight talk from the nation’s doctor. We really need you all to lean into and prioritize the health and safety of the American people. No more bickering, no more partisanship, no more criticism or finger-pointing. There’ll be plenty of time for that, but we all need to hit the reset button and lean into moving forward the health and safety of the American people as our top priority. More stories on how people can protect themselves. More on how people can get the resources that they need that we’ve unleashed from the federal government and state and local governments. Less stories looking at what happened in the past. Again, there’ll be time for that."
2020-03-14,45:46,Jerome Adams,"I want you all to understand as Dr. Fouche said, this will get worse before it gets better, but we are making progress to flatten the curve. We are making progress. Three important points. Number one, almost all people will recover, 98 and 99% of people will recover. People need to know that. And we heard a great story on NPR this morning about an 89 year old from that nursing home facility in Seattle who is recovered. Number two, we must lean into protecting the most vulnerable, those with chronic or severe medical conditions, especially seniors. Now is the time for us to lean into that and we are taking the measures to protect them at HHS, Secretary Azar, Bob Kadlec, Bob Redfield, Admiral Giroir are hard at work right now, leaning into that from the federal level."
2020-03-14,46:35,Jerome Adams,"But we need your help, social distancing and mitigation. They’re not to protect the 30 year old or the 20 year old from getting Coronavirus. They’re to protect your Nana, they’re to protect your granddaddy. They’re to protect the people who you love in your lives and we need your help. And finally, we all have a role to play. If we are complacent, selfish, uninformed, if we spread fear and distrust and misinformation, this situation will last longer and more people will be hurt. But if we pitch in and we share the facts, we will flatten the curve and we will overcome this situation. So finally, my prescription, know your risk, understand your circumstances and get the facts to protect yourself at coronavirus.gov."
2020-03-14,47:23,Mike Pence,Well done. Thank you. And Secretary and Dr. Ben Carson.
2020-03-14,47:30,Dr. Ben Carson,"Thank you Mr. Vice President. Now sometimes you have to stop and think about what’s unique about the United States. And one of the things that is really wonderful and we should just stop and think about more often is that we have so many people who are willing to put aside their self interest for the good of the nation. And I want to thank those people at the federal, state and local level who have put their own lives on pause in order to try to help their fellow Americans. It makes a big difference. But just as importantly, I want to thank the private sector. There are so many in the private sector who have volunteered their services, who have stepped up, who are willing to recognize that maybe they’re going to take a bit of a financial hit, but they recognize that we have to create the appropriate environment so that everybody can succeed in this nation. And so often we overlook those individuals. I want them to know how much we appreciate them."
2020-03-14,48:33,Dr. Ben Carson,"What we’re facing now is a significant threat. As a physician and as a surgeon, I faced a lot of very, very complex problems. And most of them we were able to overcome, not so much because of me, but because of the fact that we had incredible people working on this together. It was the teamwork that made the biggest difference in the world. And that’s what I’m seeing here in the government right now. The people behind me with others who are willing to work together as a team to be able to accomplish the goals for the American people. And I used to think we had long hours at Madison, working 24 hours straight, working at midnight, two in the morning. This team is working that way too."
2020-03-14,49:27,Dr. Ben Carson,"I frequently get calls at 9, 10, 11, midnight about putting together some policies, doing various things. And I just want to thank all the people who are involved and I hope that we as a nation can use this as an opportunity to pull together for good. Now President Trump is going to be recommending a national day of prayer. And we’ve gotten away from prayer and faith a lot in this country. There’s nothing wrong with godly principles no matter what your faith is. Loving your neighbor, caring about the people around you, developing your God given talents to the utmost so that you become valuable to the people around you. Having values and principles that govern your life. Those are things that made America zoom to the top of the world in record time. And those are the things that will keep us there too."
2020-03-14,50:30,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Okay, questions."
2020-03-14,50:34,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, first of all, can you explain why secretary Azar is not here and also can you indicate to us, one of the things the President rolled out yesterday was discussion of Google partnering with the federal government and then later Google said it was not aware that this was going to be announced and that it was not prepared in the same way the President forecast to the country. So where’s the discrepancy about the website, Google’s involvement and why is the Health and Human Services Secretary not present?"
2020-03-14,51:05,Mike Pence,"Secretary Azar was at the Coronavirus task force meeting this morning. He’s back to work and we’ll have a changing roundup for these presentations so we can get quickly to your questions. But Secretary Azar is doing a remarkable job, working seven days a week for the American people and making a difference. With regard to Google and other private partners, I know Google issued a statement that they are planning to launch a website. I think they gave a date of Monday, March 16th. We’re working literally around the clock and I know that our whole team working on this public and private partnership, couldn’t be more grateful to all of the hardworking people at Google that are helping to put this website together."
2020-03-14,52:00,Mike Pence,"But tomorrow, five o’clock we’ll have very specific description tomorrow about when the website will be available, when the parking lot sites will be available for people to be tested. And we’re working right now with state and local communities to determine where it’s best to roll those out as a number of communities are already doing a great job meeting their needs. So we’re trying to flow the resources, but five o’clock tomorrow night we’ll have details."
2020-03-14,52:34,Unnamed,Can you tell us whether you have also been tested for the Coronavirus and can you or somebody else clear up the apparent discrepancy between the letter that we’ve issued from the White House Physician’s Office just before midnight last night in which the Physician concluded that you and the President did not need to be tested?
2020-03-14,52:54,Mike Pence,"Well I know the President announced that he has been tested and I’m going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House Physician’s Office. At this point, as of last night, the White House Physician’s Office had said that neither I nor Mrs. Pence either had the symptoms or the contacts that would necessitate testing. And maybe I might ask Dr. Berks to step up. As we expand testing across the country, we want people to be able to go to a website, they’ll be a questionnaire there to determine whether or not a test is in order. Because we want to make sure that people are being tested that have the symptoms, but I’m going to speak to the White House Physician right after this press briefing and Mrs. Pence and I’d be more than happy to be tested. Dr. Berks you want to speak to."
2020-03-14,53:42,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah. Thank you Mr. Vice President for mentioning that because as I told you in South Korea there are 250,000 plus tests. About 96 plus percent were negative and that was with symptoms. So we’re working very hard integrating everything they have learned about symptoms and screening and that is going into the development of this website, so it’s not just a simple checkbox website. It’s actually going to go through critical symptoms and that’s why we’re giving ourselves the weekend to get it put up. So far in the United States from LabCorp and Quest, they’re running about a 99 to 98% negativity. This always worries me because I’ve worked in public health a long time. When you tell someone they’re negative, yes, it’s reassuring, but the last thing we want is them so reassured that they stop practicing these critical practices that are going to protect all of us."
2020-03-14,54:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"This epidemic will be stopped at the community level. Those are the individuals, it’s Americans and their response that will get us over this hump and that’s why, yes, we’ll have testing available. We’ll have to know that many are going to be negative and you’re going to have to help us carry that message, that that means just at that moment you’re negative. You need to continue to do all of your protection and protection of others to ensure you remain there."
2020-03-14,55:05,Unnamed,"To follow up on the Google question about the website, Google said that the website they are developing is in its early stages and will be limited to the San Francisco Bay area. That seems very different from what you and the President are saying."
2020-03-14,55:17,Mike Pence,"Well, what Google said was that they’re planning to launch a website this coming Monday, March 16th that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at pilot testing sites in the Bay area with the goal of expanding to other locations and we’re very grateful for that. The objective here is to have a website up very quickly that that first people in the areas that have been deeply impacted. Washington state, California, New York. Now we’ve seen community spread in Massachusetts and also Florida and so we want to make sure that we’re flowing those resources as well as those remote testing sites in that area. But that’s a statement I was handed this morning from them and again, I want to tell you folks, we’re working 24 seven on this. We’re going to have very specific details on the rollout of this new public private partnership and testing at five o’clock tomorrow."
2020-03-14,56:16,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. Vice President. Could you give us more details on the potential financial assistance for the entertainment industry, for the cruise industry, that the administration is looking at right now? And if I may on the temperature checks, were all of the members of the cabinet who were in here today, did they also have their temperatures checked? Okay, I see you nodding. But is it also the White House policy now that anyone who for instance comes into the oval office needs to have their temperature checked at the door?"
2020-03-14,56:50,Mike Pence,"I’d refer those questions to the White House Physician’s Office. I have been informed that they’re establishing new protocols for temperature checks and I had my temperature checked too. Let me ask the Secretary of the Treasury to address what may be the next few innings. I thought Secretary Mnuchin put it very well, we got the initial support, $8.3 billion from the Congress. The house passed legislation to act on the President’s priorities. But we understand, the President’s made it very, very clear. Whether it’s our airline industry, our cruise industry, that we expect to be coming back to Congress to make sure that our, as we put the health of America first, as businesses make those hard choices to make a priority of the health of their employees or of those that they serve or their customers, that we’re going to make sure that they can come all the way back. Mr. Secretary."
2020-03-14,57:45,Steve Mnuchin,"So let me just emphasize that this is a unique circumstance. This isn’t like the financial crisis where people didn’t know how long this was going to go on. And let me just say there’s no question because of the things that we’re requesting people to do, there are parts of the economy that are shutting down or slowing down dramatically. And as I said before and I said yesterday, we are committed to use all the tools and all the resources of the government to make sure that we protect the economy. So many of the industries that you’ve talked about, as I said, the airlines are the most obvious because we have a unique circumstance where we have shutdown travel and these are of strategic importance to us."
2020-03-14,58:28,Steve Mnuchin,"But we appreciate there’s many industries that are impacted by this. I would also say there’s many individuals. The President has talked about a stimulus program, whether it’s through a payroll tax cut, whether it’s through refundable tax credits. We are 100% committed and I can assure you there is bipartisan support. So we have a lot of tools, the fed has a lot of tools. Some of these tools we don’t have that we had in the financial crisis. We’ll be going back to Congress. And one of the reasons why this bill was so important is this is just now the second step on bipartisan support. We will make sure that the economy recovers out of this and whatever support."
2020-03-14,59:09,Unnamed,"If I may follow up, how much more money would you like to see? I’m not talking about the previous bill, I’m talking about the future for those industries."
2020-03-14,59:16,Steve Mnuchin,"Let me just comment. It would be premature to comment on specific money as I said. I use the analogy of we’re in a baseball game and we’re in the early innings. We have a hundred different things that we’re looking at. Yesterday the President announced on student loans, suspending interest. That was one of the things. He announced using the strategic oil reserve. This is a great time. We also have a unique circumstance having nothing to do with the Coronavirus. Parts of our economy are very much impacted by the temporary low price of oil, so the President, the Vice President and everybody else is 100% committed. We’ve got a hundred different ideas and whatever we need to do, we will do."
2020-03-14,59:58,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, thank you so much. I have a question for you and if I can for Dr. Berks first. First for you, sir, if I may. Your language has changed a bit. You’ve tweaked it a little bit. Early on you said that there was a low risk for the average American to contract the Coronavirus."
2020-03-14,01:00:15,Mike Pence,Right.
2020-03-14,01:00:16,Unnamed,"Recently, your language has altered a little bit. You’re saying the risk of a serious illness remains low. Can you address why the change, is the potential of contracting the virus for an average American no longer low? Why the change, sir?"
2020-03-14,01:00:31,Mike Pence,"Well, I’m going to let Dr. Berks address that because the reason we’re…"
2020-03-14,01:00:35,Unnamed,"Which sir and you are the Vice President, if you don’t mind sir."
2020-03-14,01:00:38,Mike Pence,"Everything that we are communicating to the public is based on what is the unanimous opinion of our health experts based upon the information that we have at the time. It’s now a little more than a few weeks since we had our first instance of community spread in the United States and letting the American people know that the President took every step to prevent the Coronavirus from coming into our country. I think you can’t overstate how unprecedented and extraordinary the suspension of all travel from China was when the President made that decision before the end of January. And the travel advisories with portions of Italy, South Korea, the screening of personnel coming into our country. But allow me to let Dr. Berks address that because what we’re going to continue to do is tell the American people straight from the health experts the best information that we have to see to their own health, the health of their family and their community. Dr. Berks."
2020-03-14,01:01:37,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, thank you Mr. Vice President. So every day we analyze data from around the world and look at age groups that are impacted, look at and try to get a sense of the amount of asymptomatic patients. Now remember, all of the groups that are doing screening are screening on symptoms. And so we’re trying to figure out based on that information and based on the profile of the epidemic to really understand is there a whole group under 20 that really doesn’t get significant symptoms. Yet, we don’t believe that uniquely people under 20 are naturally protected from the virus. So are they a group that are potentially asymptomatic and spreading the virus. Because of that and because of that unknown, we don’t want to say that the risk is low when we don’t know how low the numbers are for people who are asymptomatic. We have a good sense of the number of people who are having symptoms and we have a good sense of who is deeply impacted by this."
2020-03-14,01:02:41,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I mean if you look at all the data coming out of all of the countries that we triangulate on a twice a day basis, people of a certain age are at higher risk for a worse outcome. And that’s why we have been so laser focused on that. But the other side of the epidemic is how much transmission. And until you really understand how many people are asymptomatic and asymptomatically passing the virus on, we think it’s better for the entire American public to know that the risk of serious illness may be low, but they could be potentially spreading the virus to others. And that’s why we’re asking every American to take personal responsibility to prevent that spread. And that’s why we’ve made all of these recommendations broad even past people who have symptoms or no symptoms because we need to have everybody taking precautions."
2020-03-14,01:03:36,Unnamed,"You said tomorrow you’re speaking to all of the Governors, are we?"
2020-03-14,01:03:38,Mike Pence,Monday.
2020-03-14,01:03:38,Unnamed,"Oh Monday, I’m sorry."
2020-03-14,01:03:39,Mike Pence,Yeah.
2020-03-14,01:03:39,Unnamed,"So you are going to speak to all of the Governors. Are we looking at any sort of domestic travel restrictions that could be coming down the pipeline anytime soon? And my other question for you is Leader McConnell’s statement saying that he was going to read the bill, that he was going to speak to some of his members over the weekend. Are you confident that the Senate is going to take up this house legislation and get it done quickly?"
2020-03-14,01:03:57,Mike Pence,"Well, the President expressed strong support for the legislation. It received a very large bipartisan vote in the house, but we respect the process. I’m grateful for the support that Leader McConnell has expressed for the process and the priorities that the President has outlined. We’ll be working with members of the Senate to unpack the bill for them and why President Trump endorsed it yesterday and we believe that they should move it expeditiously to passage. With regard to additional travel restrictions…"
2020-03-14,01:04:34,Unnamed,In the U.S.
2020-03-14,01:04:35,Mike Pence,"But let me just say, as the President said, we’re considering a broad range of measures but no decisions have been made yet. But I just want to assure the American people of two things. We’re going to continue to follow the facts. We’re going to continue to listen to the experts about recommendations. We’ll bring as we did this week when the President made the decision to suspend all travel from Europe. We’ll bring the best recommendations of our healthcare experts to the President. And I promise you, and I promise the American people, this President is going to continue to take every step necessary to protect the American people and put the health of the American people first and together we’ll get through this. Thank you."
2020-03-14,01:05:26,Unnamed,What’s being done to help those in public housing during this Coronavirus. What’s been done to help those in public housing?
2020-03-15,00:06,Donald Trump,"Beautiful day outside. And then I think we have some great things to talk about. I’ll start by discussing the Federal Reserve. As you know, it just happened minutes ago, but to me it makes me very happy. And I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve. For starters, they’ve lowered the fed rate from what it was, which was one to 1.25. And it’s been lowered down to zero to 0.25 or 0.25. So it’s zero to .25 that’s a big difference. It’s a quite a bit, about a point."
2020-03-15,00:47,Donald Trump,"And in addition, very importantly, the Federal Reserve going to be purchasing $500 billion of treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage backed securities. And that number can increase, but they’re going to start with that and that’s really good news. It’s really great for our country. It’s something that we’re very happy, I have to say this. I’m very happy and they did it in one step. They didn’t do it in four steps over a long period of time. They did it on one step."
2020-03-15,01:18,Donald Trump,"And I think that people in the market should be very thrilled. And that brings us, we’re the strongest country in the world by far financially and every other way. And that brings us in line with what other countries are. They actually have negative rates, but look, we got it down to potentially zero. So that’s a big step and I’m very happy they did it."
2020-03-15,01:43,Donald Trump,"And you will not hear anything bad about me unless it’s about a month or two from now. So I congratulate the Federal Reserve. I think it’s terrific. Just came out just as we spoke, I wasn’t going to mention Federal Reserve or anything else, but this came out as we were walking up."
2020-03-15,01:58,Donald Trump,"I want to thank the people at Google and Google communications because as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, called us and he apologized. I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. But as you know, this is from Google. They put out a release and you guys can figure it out yourselves. And how that got out, and I’m sure you’ll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful."
2020-03-15,02:32,Donald Trump,"I just had a phone call with very impressive people, the biggest in the world, in the world of stores and groceries and all. And I’ll give you the names Dave Clark, Whole Foods. Mark Clouse, CEO of Campbell Soup Company. Brian Cornell, CEO of Target, Randy Edeker, Chairman and CEO, President of Hy-Vee, Jeff Haremning, CEO of General Mills, great company. Kevin Birkin President, CEO of Sysco. Craig Jelinek, CEO of Costco. Todd Jones, CEO of Publix Supermarkets, Donnie King Tyson Foods. David MacLennan, Chairman and CEO of Cargill. Rodney McMillan, CEO, Chairman of Kroger, big company. Doug McMillan, CEO of Walmart. He’s been fantastic. Doug was here, as you know, on Friday and he watched the market go up 2000 points on Friday. It went up 2000 almost 2000 points. Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General Corporation, and Vivek San Quran, President and CEO of Albertson’s."
2020-03-15,04:03,Donald Trump,"So these are all phenomenal companies. He’s a great companies. We had a long conversation with them and they’re going to work 24 hours around the clock, keeping their store stocked. I would like to say that people shouldn’t go out and buy. We’re going to all be great. We’re going to be so good. We’re going to do, what’s happened with the fed is phenomenal news. What’s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news. But you don’t have to buy so much. Take it easy. Just relax. People are going in and they’re buying more. I remember, I guess during the conversation, Doug of Walmart said that they buying more than they buy a Christmas. Relax, we’re doing great. It all will pass."
2020-03-15,04:47,Donald Trump,"The folks that we spoke to, they’ve done a fantastic job. They’re going to meet the needs of the public. They’re going round the clock if they have to and they’re committed to the communities where they’re serving and which they serve so beautifully and have for a long time. And they’re buying a lot of additional things to sell. But again, they actually have asked me to say, “Could you buy a little bit less please?” I thought I’d never hear that from a retailer. All of them are working hand in hand with the Federal Government as well as the state and local leaders to ensure food and essentials are constantly available. And they’ll do it. There’s no shortages. We have no shortages other than people are buying anywhere from three to five times what they would normally buy."
2020-03-15,05:31,Donald Trump,"It’s going to be there for a long time. We’re doing numbers and there’s a pent up demand that’s incredible. When this passes, when this goes through, you’re going to see numbers. I think, I predict, I guess I’m allowed to predict just like Wall Street people are allowed to predict and they’re pretty much in agreement. You’re going to see there’s a pent up demand like a lot of people including me haven’t seen before. But this has to get through."
2020-03-15,05:57,Donald Trump,"They know they’re getting through the crisis and will require an all of America approach and that’s very important. They’re committed to remaining open during this crisis. Totally open. They have to stay open. Those doors have to stay open. They supply our country. Our supply chains in America, the most powerful in the world, and they’re all working very hard. They’re working around the clock and the stores are stocking up at a level that’s beyond Christmas time. And it’s great. It was very reassuring speaking to these people. They have a totally in hand."
2020-03-15,06:28,Donald Trump,"There’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies. They said to me, “Could you please tell them just go and buy. Enjoy it, have a nice dinner, relax because there’s plenty.” You don’t have to buy the quantities because it’s hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as they’re refilling them."
2020-03-15,06:50,Donald Trump,"And we are using the full power of the Federal Government to defeat the coronavirus. And we will do whatever it takes and we’re doing, I think really, really well. A lot of good things are going to happen. I want to thank all of the people standing behind me. These are phenomenal people and we have some of them right over here. But the people behind me have been working around the clock and they’re doing an incredible job."
2020-03-15,07:18,Donald Trump,"We see what’s happening. We see what’s going on in other countries. We’re learning from watching other countries, frankly. This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible, but it’s something that we have a tremendous control of. I think very important the young people, people of good health and groups of people just are not strongly affected. Elderly people that are not well or not well in certain respects are a really a very dangerous group. We have to watch them, we have to protect them very much. We have to really watch over them and protect them because they are very vulnerable. And with that if it’s okay I’m just going to go and make some calls. I’m talking about Federal Reserve. I think it’s a tremendous thing that took place just now. I didn’t know I would be surprised on a Sunday. I don’t know if that’s ever happened on a Sunday before, but I would think there are a lot of people on Wall Street that are very happy. And I can tell you that I’m very happy. I didn’t expect this and I like being surprised. So our Vice President who is doing an incredible job is going to take over and I will see you probably tomorrow."
2020-03-15,08:26,Donald Trump,Thank you you very much.
2020-03-15,08:40,Mike Pence,"Well thank you Mr. President and good afternoon. With more than 2,900 cases of coronavirus in 49 states across the country I want to assure the American people that this administration, all of our partners, the state level and local health officials have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American public. And at the president’s direction we will continue not only a whole of government approach but as we’ll discuss today we’ll continue to build on a whole of America approach to confront the coronavirus across the country."
2020-03-15,09:17,Mike Pence,"The health experts continue to confirm to us that based on the latest information, for the American people as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low. But because the risk is heavily weighted to the most vulnerable, to people with immunodeficiencies and to people who are elderly with serious underlying chronic health conditions. Our administration and I know state administrations will continue to focus on the most vulnerable. And we will continue to urge every American to be vigilant in practicing good hygiene. Taking the advice of the CDC and local health experts to keep those most vulnerable, safe."
2020-03-15,10:04,Mike Pence,"I know I speak on behalf of the president and our entire team when I say how grateful we are for governors all across the country and the seamless partnership that we have forged with them and with state health officials, with our federal team. I spoke today to Governor Pritzker of Illinois and we are in continuous communication with governors, a phone call away. They know that they, they can contact us and address even the smallest need. Because as a former governor, I know firsthand that when it comes to health challenges in America, our states are on the ground in the lead, our local health organizations and we’ve built a great partnership."
2020-03-15,10:47,Mike Pence,"We also want to express great appreciation to the American people. Not surprisingly, it is inspiring to see the way tens of millions of Americans are responding with compassion, with common sense. And we want to express particular gratitude to communities of faith that participated in today’s National Day of Prayer."
2020-03-15,11:06,Mike Pence,"We’ve seen places of worship, implementing policies to keep those most vulnerable, safe. And also we’re seeing communities of faith already stepping forward to support and to encourage those most vulnerable. I heard tell of a church back in Indiana that’s actually no longer having services until April 10th. But in the meantime there’ll be offering daycare to the children of healthcare workers in central Indiana. And churches all across the country are taking the opportunity to reach out and put feed on their faith and it’s, it’s truly inspiring."
2020-03-15,11:44,Mike Pence,"As president mentioned today, he spoke today to leaders in the grocery store industry and where people buy our food. And we heard and were reminded that America has the most efficient and effective supply chain in the world. And it’s working just fine. As the president said, he received a commitment from those a grocery store executives that stores will stay open throughout the days that lie ahead."
2020-03-15,12:14,Mike Pence,"We were told that hours may be reduced to allow for cleaning and to resupply, but American families can be confident. Your local grocery store is going to be open, it’s going to be well supplied and they specifically asked us to encourage Americans just buy your weekly needs and grocery. Because the grocery stores will remain open."
2020-03-15,12:36,Mike Pence,Also very movingly those same executives all reiterated their commitment to continue to support local food banks in the way that our grocers continue to do around America. Tomorrow president and I will be briefing all the nation’s governors of states and territories and the District of Columbia. We will be speaking about the progress that we’re making and we’ll be speaking to them specifically about our widening partnership on expanding testing to the American people.
2020-03-15,13:07,Mike Pence,So allow me to speak to that issue and then I’m going to recognize Admiral Brett Giroir who will describe for us the the excellent work that public health services doing. Dr. Burks will describe the importance of the new national public private partnership for diagnostic testing that is going to open the door to the thousands of more tests in real time for the American people in the days ahead.
2020-03-15,13:37,Mike Pence,"First, some fundamentals. As the American people know, testing is now available in all 50 States. Either state labs are either conducting the tests themselves or the CDC is processing tests. They’re using the traditional manner of a manual test that allows for 40 to 60 tests a day. It is among the reasons why the president several weeks ago tasked for this group at the White House to reach out to commercial labs around the country and forge that public/private partnership that would bring the high speed, or more accurately the high throughput testing, for coronavirus available in real time. And based on the unprecedented speed of the FDA, which last week approved high throughput coronavirus testings for Roche and Thermo Fisher. We will now have access in the days ahead to more than 2000 labs across the country that have the equipment today to process coronavirus tests much more rapidly in a much higher volume for the American people."
2020-03-15,14:46,Mike Pence,"In terms of delivering those services more than 10 States in addition to a CDC labs, public health labs and labs that states can now authorize in their states. More than 10 States have implemented their own drive through testing sites. And we want to commend New York, Colorado, Delaware, Washington State, Texas, and others that have implemented these onsite places where people can obtain tests. Most are using the current CDC testing, the manual testing. But we are working closely with our governors, as you will hear momentarily, to make sure that the new testing regimen is available for their remote sites as well."
2020-03-15,15:33,Mike Pence,"As I mentioned as of Monday, we will have more than 2000 labs coming online with the high speed testing. And we are connecting states to those testing methods. We’re also working with a number of retail partners to add to the work that states are doing around the country. Working to set up parking lot testing centers outside of stores and Admiral Brett Giroir will detail the progress that we’ve made over the last 72 hours."
2020-03-15,16:04,Mike Pence,Following the president’s declaration of emergency the Admiral and our public health service of have forged a partnership now with FEMA made possible by that declaration. And they’ve reached out to all 50 States to create a process that will enable all Americans who need to be tested to go to a community based testing site outside of usual healthcare facilities. The focus of these tests as Dr Burks will describe momentarily will be on the those most in need. A priority will be placed on healthcare workers and first responders who are out there coming alongside people that are being impacted by the coronavirus. We want to make sure they have access to the testing as a priority. And then Americans 65 or over with a cough or a fever or other symptoms will be prioritized over other tests that are extended.
2020-03-15,17:01,Mike Pence,"As I mentioned, Admiral Giroir will describe the progress that we’ve made in just a few moments. But we’re going to continue to work very diligently, hour by hour, day by day in the days ahead to expand testing around the country. And access to this extraordinary and unprecedented national public/ private partnership for diagnostic testing."
2020-03-15,17:24,Mike Pence,"With regard to testing, as we expand testing, we’re so pleased that Congress joined with our administration to make sure that cost is never going to be a barrier to anyone getting a coronavirus test. As you recall, several weeks ago the president directed a change in our Medicare and Medicaid programs to ensure the coronavirus testing was included. Health insurers were brought in, they all agreed to waive copays. But because of the good bipartisan work done in the House of Representatives now all coronavirus testing is free and it’s free for every American, including uninsured Americans. And we continue to urge passage of the legislation that will be considered by the Senate this week."
2020-03-15,18:08,Mike Pence,"Let me say one final word about the testing issue. And that is that as the president often says, “We’re all in this together.” And it’s absolutely important that as we expand testing resources across the country, beginning by prioritizing the areas that CDC and our state leadership tell us are most important. It’s important that the tests are available for people that are most in need and for our healthcare workers and first responders that are helping them and supporting them. As Dr. Burks will describe, the testing that is available should only be done if for any reason you think you may have the coronavirus. We encourage people to consult their doctor and if you’re symptom free, we then encourage you to work with us to make sure the testing is available for people that are experiencing symptoms."
2020-03-15,19:10,Mike Pence,"It’s extremely important that we have the continuing cooperation of every American as we expand testing and make it available during this challenging time in the life of our nation. With that, I’m going to ask Admiral Brett Giroir of the Public Health Service and leader of this great commission corps behind me to come up and describe the extraordinary work that they have done over the last 72 hours. And will be doing each and every day in conjunction with our states to expand testing to community based testing across the country for the American people using this new public/private partnership diagnostic testing. Admiral."
2020-03-15,19:53,Brett Giroir,"Thank you Mr. Vice President, and thank you for your personal interest and support of our team over the last 72 hours as we worked on this critically important."
2020-03-15,20:03,Brett Giroir,"… Over the last 72 hours, as we worked on this critically important project. So as the Vice President said over the past 72 hours, we have developed and are beginning to implement now a process and a program of testing that will enable Americans who are in need of coronavirus testing to be tested effectively and efficiently according to a few principles."
2020-03-15,20:28,Brett Giroir,"Number one, we want to assure that those most vulnerable and those impacted are able to be prioritized. Number two, we don’t want to do testing that in any way threatens the acute care system. In other words, we don’t want people going to hospitals and acute care clinics where number one, they could infect other people or subject themselves to infections. And number three, we want to balance the needs across the entire healthcare system among diagnosis, but also treatment. In other words, we want the balance, the stress on the strategic national stockpile, and all our commodities so that everyone gets all the materials they need."
2020-03-15,21:09,Brett Giroir,"So what do we do? Because as the Vice President said, last week’s historically fast approval of high throughput testing, we are now in a new phase of testing. And you’ve heard Dr. Fauci talk about the new phase. So we’re going from somewhat manual, relatively slow phases, to a testing regimen that we can test many tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals per week and maybe even more. We will have 1.9 million of these high throughput tests available this week with numerous labs up to 2000, starting to turn the lights on beginning this week and rolling out over the week."
2020-03-15,21:47,Brett Giroir,"That is really a game changer for us because the back of the shop testing capability is there. The front of the shop is what we’ve been really working on. In order to get a test there, you’ve got to be able to swab individuals, get them into the system without completely paralyzing the entire healthcare system as we have. So with the emergency declaration, this was very, very important to us because it really enabled the historically effective processes of working and empowering states. Federally-supported state-led efforts through the normal FEMA mechanisms."
2020-03-15,22:24,Brett Giroir,"So for the last 72 hours, representatives of FEMA from across the government and our Commission Corps have been working on joining the unique and unprecedented public health mission with the historically successful mission of personal distribution centers, places for distribution, the pod system of FEMA. Our public health service, we’ve already deployed over a thousand officers in support of the coronavirus missions that includes to the Diamond, to the borders, to the quarantine stations, to the acute care settings where we’re caring for nursing home residents in Seattle. So we have a very experienced group and we brought these together."
2020-03-15,23:14,Brett Giroir,"So what we’ve really designed and how we’re working with the states, we have contacted all 50 states through the FEMA system, every single region, every single state, to understand where they are. As the Vice President said, some states are rolling out some of their own community-based testing. They need to be augmented. We believe we’ve created a model based on the public health and the FEMA system that is optimized that can be used for drive through, or potentially walk through. Each of these pod based units we believe can screen 2,000 to 4,000 individuals a day for testing, with all the appropriate personal protective gear, all the appropriate backend and linkage to the public health system including testing. We know that we have the logistics to do that. We know we have the materials to do that. And again, this is federally-supported state-led efforts. Many states need the full meal deal. They want dozens of public health service officers to work in protective gear to actually test. They need supplies like protective gear, they need swabs, they need logistical supports. Other states only need a fraction of that. They may have all the personnel, but they really need the knowhow, the template, and some of the gear that we provide. We are going to start implementing this system this week in a number of states, primarily those that are the hardest hit right now or are on the rise and the CDC has advised us that that’s when they need the testing."
2020-03-15,24:48,Brett Giroir,"I want to emphasize again that we’re focusing on two very important groups. And you’ll hear this said three or four different ways. And the groups that really can be the most impacted or impactful in our outbreak. Number one, is healthcare workers and first responders. This is very important for two reasons. Number one, we have to take care of the healthcare workers in responders because when America needs them, they need to be available, healthy, to provide the care that we all deserve. But it’s also important that if they feel they have a risk of having contacted coronavirus, that we test them so they cannot spread that, for example in longterm care facilities where the elderly are."
2020-03-15,25:29,Brett Giroir,"And the second group would be the elderly. And we are classifying that according to risk as those 65 years of age or older, who have a respiratory symptom and a fever of 99.6. That’s a lower number than you’ve seen before, because those who are older do not spike high fevers like children do, 104, 105, so you set the bar just a little bit lower. We do that because we know that they are high risk of bad consequences. And if they test positive, they can engage with their practitioner or tell a health provider, or get in the system to make sure they have a just an outstanding outcome."
2020-03-15,26:06,Brett Giroir,"So that is really where we are. We’ve made really unprecedented progress. You will see these sites rolling out progressively over the week. This is not make believe, this is not fantasy. We’ve developed a model, we’ve talked to the states, we’re focusing in on specific locations now. We will start shipping gear stuff tomorrow. We will start deploying officers tomorrow and Tuesday, and we’ll begin seeing these sites in addition to the ones that are springing up now implemented during this week. We will have the capability of testing tens of thousands of additional people through these sites every week in addition to all the capability that’s now going to be distributed in the 2000 laboratories in the major central core laboratories."
2020-03-15,26:54,Brett Giroir,And I know you have a number of questions that hopefully in the question and answer session we’ll be able to answer for you. But I think this is just a great linkage. I’m a pediatric ICU doctor. I take care of sick people. I know what happens when you get respiratory illness. The surgeon general is an anesthesiologist who takes care of people who have respiratory difficulties and manages that. So we know how this works. We’ve been there. The most important thing we’ve worked on right now is making testing accessible because of the advances of the FDA and private industry to make these high throughput tests. Now we can work on the front end with the emergency declaration.
2020-03-15,27:30,Brett Giroir,"We have all the tools and all of government has really come together with industry, not just government and states. It’s really been private industry, the manufacturers to bring the swabs, the personal protective gear, the laboratory testing, the shipping, the fronts with Walgreens and Walmarts working as potential sites. This has been something in my mind has been unprecedented the entire society approach working so intensely over the past, certainly over the past weeks but incredibly on this project over the past 72 hours."
2020-03-15,28:03,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Admiral. And let me say we are moving out now that we have the public private partnership with the major commercial labs, and now you have our public health team as well as FEMA moving out, connecting to the states to deploy these point of distribution community centers. We’ll also be working closely with members of the media and individual jurisdictions, as well as we’re working with Google and other tech companies to make sure that there’s online resources where people will be able to readily access a questionnaire that will walk them through the symptoms, and whether or not a test might be indicated. And also in the days ahead, we look forward to that same website being able to direct people to the nearest community center or drive through center that’s available."
2020-03-15,28:54,Mike Pence,"But me let me introduce Dr. Deborah Birx to speak about that patient experience, and about the importance of the right people seeking the testing in the days ahead. Doctor."
2020-03-15,29:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr. Vice President. Let me just start by recognizing the men and women of the military who are serving us every day, they are my brothers and sisters. I was privileged to serve alongside them for quite a long time. But critically, I just want to recognize at this moment the public health Commission Corps behind me. The Vice President, although he didn’t speak to this, actually went to see them yesterday at the place where they were working so that we wouldn’t disturb them because of their level of dedication and work through the last really 48 hours nonstop. So thank you. Thank you for your work and thank you for the work that you brought together and thank you Admiral for explaining it so quickly."
2020-03-15,29:49,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Let me just go back to the way laboratory work is done in the United States. I think all of you know when you go to your doctor and you need a lab test, it is either done in your doctor’s office, or it’s done in the lab that they send you to. When we started this emergency response to this virus, we started with what we knew, and that was the flu platform that we use for surveillance. It wasn’t set up in your doctors office, it wasn’t set up in our hospital laboratories. It was set up in state and local labs and at the CDC. Over the last two weeks, we’ve been working with the groups that have served you for decades."
2020-03-15,30:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The commercial laboratories that you don’t see, but your specimen goes to, to ensure they had the full capacity to meet the needs of the American people. Because it wasn’t going to be 50 to 100 to 1000 tests. It was going to be tens of thousands of tests that would be needed to be done. And so the last two weeks has been spent on really getting what you are used to the full force of the clinical laboratories and service. At the same time, what you heard described here is how do we serve the needs of the people in the community where they reside, where we know when we’re talking about people with vulnerable conditions, immunosuppression, medical conditions, or the elderly, that we don’t want them having to sit for long times in doctor’s office, in hospitals’ waiting rooms."
2020-03-15,31:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And you see what state and local governors have done to move past what we would normally do, a referral to your doctor’s office, into your hospital, but really providing community-led services to provide this testing. What the federal government is doing is augmenting that, augmenting the innovation that existed in South Korea, brought here to the shores of the United States and broaden our own novel way, but utilizing our healthcare delivery system, which is different than South Korea, and adapting our work to our system."
2020-03-15,31:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So to the hospitals and to the laboratories, we know that there will be pent up demand for this. Make sure every hospital, every laboratory, I’m speaking to the people who work in labs like I did myself. Make sure you have enough pipette tips, pipetters, and all of the equipment that you need to run this laboratory. You know what you need. Make sure you have that, and have that available for these tests. Because we know with this increased sampling, this increase ability to have community access, additional samples will be going to these laboratories. They can manage the high throughput, but they need all of the supplies that they would normally need to run these tests."
2020-03-15,32:31,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Think of it, if you’re doing HIV viral load, same thing. Just what you need, you know what you need, make sure you have that. That will be run, and the most important thing, I know for each and every one of you, is how am I going to get my results? And so we’re making sure also that the end of reporting is also there, that the reporting is available to you, to your doctor, and also to the state and local governments and the federal government, not with your personal identifiers but to really understand where there are positives, where there are negatives, so we can assure that healthcare providers have what they need to meet the demands of the American people and their health needs when they’re there."
2020-03-15,33:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Now, let me just say one bit about reporting. So you will notice as these tests roll out over this next week, we will have a spike in our curve. For those of you who watched China and China reporting, remember when they changed their definition and all of a sudden there was a blip in their curve? We are going to see that. We are going to see a spike as more and more people have access. And I want to finish by again reminding people how important it is. I know everybody’s going to want to go to these drive throughs, but if we could prioritize like we have asked you to prioritize the care of every person with a preexisting condition and immunosuppression, and the elderly with existing conditions."
2020-03-15,33:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’ve asked you to prioritize them and we ask you to prioritize them in the lines. So that our first responders, and our healthcare providers, and everybody who has difficulty to get to doctor’s offices can utilize this system while we bring all the other traditional systems that you are used to, and have availability for you online over the next few days and weeks. So thank you. Thank you for constantly reminding us how important it’s a response of all of America for Americans. All of America, for Americans. It’s a privilege to be part of this solution and be part of this team. And again, I want to close by recognizing the Commission Corps. I’m not sure they had anything but pizza to eat for the last two days… Donuts. All right. Don’t follow their guidance."
2020-03-15,34:48,Mike Pence,Dr. Fauci.
2020-03-15,34:51,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I’ll be very brief. I just want to say listening to the description of Admiral Giroir, I’m very pleased to see how things have evolved. I think we could describe this as entering into a new phase in the testing space available here in the United States. You’ve heard me on many of these briefings talk about the multifaceted armamentarium that we have to address the crisis of what the world is seeing, and the challenge that we’re seeing right here in the United States. I mean, obviously, the travel restrictions have been in my mind a very, very positive way that we have prevented more of the input from outside in that would seat us and make our job more difficult."
2020-03-15,35:36,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And then we have, as I’ve mentioned, the containment and the mitigation from within. You’re going to be hearing more about advanced guidelines about that more precise instructions of how we can implement this mitigation within the community. But now that we have a situation that is going to be rolled out, and remember, I want to emphasize what was just said. We’re not going to go from here to there overnight. It’s going to be a gradual ratcheting up that I believe is going to happen quickly, so that then we can start talking about things and put behind us the multiple, multiple understandable questions about testing and move on to see how we can make this multifaceted approach really work for us."
2020-03-15,36:16,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Because as I’ve said many times, and I’ll repeat it, the worst is ahead for us. It is how we respond to that challenge that’s going to determine what the ultimate end point is going to be. We have a very, very critical point now. If you look at the curves that I’ve described multiple, multiple times, this window that we’re in is going to be very important for us to stay ahead of this curve. Thank you."
2020-03-15,36:44,Mike Pence,Questions? Yes.
2020-03-15,36:48,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, we’ve seen a number of communities across the country that are starting to either close restaurants, some are even doing curfews. Do you envision this happening kind of nationwide where you’ll see some rules come to affect saying, “We don’t want people out at places they’re not… Essentially a Walmart or a grocery store of some kind or a testing center?” And then also I would be curious to see, we’ve also heard so many travelers today that were coming back from these airports, people that were flying back. They were so concerned, I’m sure the Secretary will address it, but these folks that are wondering now, did they catch it because they were stuck waiting in line for hours and hours of customs? Your thoughts on that, sir?"
2020-03-15,37:22,Mike Pence,"Well, we will have updated guidelines tomorrow morning for you that are being vetted now with CDC and all of our top healthcare experts. But what I would just recommend to the American people is to review those federal guidelines, and know that we’ll also respect and defer to decisions that are made by governors, by state health departments about what’s best for that community. What my healthcare team, some of the best people in the world, tell me very regularly, is that it’s very important that you follow the data. And you make decisions based on the circumstances that are taking place in that community. But we’ll have more broad based recommendations for the American public tomorrow. And let me say, I’m going to ask the Secretary to come up and speak about the screening issue. The president made a decision to suspend all travel from Europe. That is underway now, and as of midnight Monday night, we will be suspending all travel from the UK and Ireland as well. But Americans may come home. But out of an abundance of caution, we are engaging in healthcare screenings at 13 different airports around the country and working diligently in that regard to put the safety of the American public first. And we’re asking returning Americans to self quarantine for 14 days if they’ve been in those countries in Europe. And as of Monday, the UK and Ireland that are being impacted by the Coronavirus. But the Secretary and I spoke this morning, I spoke with Governor Pritzker and Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois this morning about some challenges at O’Hare airport, and I’m going to let the Secretary speak to how we are addressing those going forward. Mr. Secretary."
2020-03-15,39:21,Secretary Chad Wolf,"Well, yesterday we began processing again the travel restrictions from passengers from the Shingon area, which totaled more than 40,000 passengers yesterday. So to give you an idea, in one day, we processed over half of the total number of individuals we have processed medical screening since February 2nd. So that is an enormous challenge that we have placed on our officers and contract medical staff at airports, and they are stepping up. But to be clear, the lines again that we saw overnight at a limited number of airports, including Chicago, are unacceptable. Acting Commissioner, CVP Commissioner Morgan also believes they’re unacceptable and has personally engaged leadership at all 13 funneling airports. We did make the necessary adjustments at 12 of the funneling airports."
2020-03-15,40:03,Secretary Chad Wolf,"We did make the necessary adjustments at 12 of the funneling airports. However, again, at Chicago those adjustments were not made quick enough, but we have course corrected. We’ve adjusted our processes, we continue to surge personnel, and we are certainly glad to see certain airports and certain airlines step up, partner with us and help address this unprecedented situation."
2020-03-15,40:21,Secretary Chad Wolf,"As I walked in here today, so far today at all of our funneling airports to include Chicago, we have an average wait time of 30 minutes. So we addressed the problem, we identified the problem, addressed it and we have fixed it and we look forward to, again, accommodating passengers this evening as well. I understand the frustration that some passengers who are returning to the US might have with some of these procedures, but I would just say, and rest assure, that we are continuing our strict protocols of looking at individuals as they come into the country, make sure that they are medically screened, make sure that we are capturing the information for the public health officials, the state and local officials, and we’ll continue to do that. And we’ve done that specifically at the President’s request. Thank you."
2020-03-15,41:07,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Secretary, has there been any talk, sir, of any sort of shutdown of domestic air travel at all?"
2020-03-15,41:12,Secretary Chad Wolf,"Well, we continue to look at all options and all options remain on the table to address, and we’ll certainly adjust as the medical professionals at CDC address the medical situation."
2020-03-15,41:21,Mike Pence,Very good. Good job.
2020-03-15,41:26,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, Dr. Fauci this morning said that the federal government should do whatever it takes to increase Americans’ social distancing and encourage that practice. He didn’t rule out the possibility of a national lockdown. If Americans don’t take those steps on their own, is that something that the federal government is prepared to do? And secondly, I’d also like to know, the President, we just heard him say Americans should relax. Why aren’t we hearing more from him about what Americans can do as they are seeing this huge impact on their daily lives, whether it’s at airports or at restaurants or other places around the country?"
2020-03-15,42:05,Mike Pence,"Well, everything that the White House Coronavirus Task Force does is at the direction of the President of the United States. All the efforts of all federal agencies and cooperation with state governments and local health officials is reflective of the decisive leadership the President has brought this early on. It’s important to remember that the President on January 31st suspended all travel from China."
2020-03-15,42:35,Mike Pence,"I said to Dr. Fauci who I’ll call up to address your other question in a moment. I said to Dr. Fauci today, as we look at Europe now being the epicenter of the coronavirus, I asked him if we had not suspended all travel from China, what our circumstance would be, and he essentially said we’d be where Europe is today."
2020-03-15,42:58,Mike Pence,"And the President also the actions with regard to Europe and recently expanded those. So the American people can be confident that President Trump is going to continue to act without hesitation on the advice of our healthcare professionals to put the health and safety of the American people first. But with regard to the statement that you made, I’m going to let Dr. Fauci address that as well."
2020-03-15,43:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah, I meant everything I said this morning on the shows, that really to protect the American people we’ll consider anything and everything on the table. You’re going to see some advanced and updated guidelines tomorrow. They’re going to address some but not all of the questions and concerns. But on a day by day basis we look at this and literally we will do everything that we can to make sure we safeguard the health and the wellbeing of the American people, and that means everything and anything we’ll consider."
2020-03-15,43:51,Unnamed (Reporter),"Could we continue for Dr. Fauci, could you give us some examples? You say anything, everything. Like what?"
2020-03-15,44:01,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Like-
2020-03-15,44:02,Unnamed (Reporter),"Like what Europe is doing? No bars, no restaurants-"
2020-03-15,44:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That could be, absolutely. I mean that could be."
2020-03-15,44:08,Unnamed (Reporter),"But if new guidance is coming tomorrow, can you give us a more concrete idea right now?"
2020-03-15,44:11,Dr. Anthony Fauci,I don’t want-
2020-03-15,44:11,Unnamed (Reporter),You must know what it is.
2020-03-15,44:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, what I don’t want to do, is I don’t want to jump ahead of the guidance. I promise you, let the guidance come out. We’ll be here every day. I’ll answer the question after the guidance. I promise you. Okay."
2020-03-15,44:21,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, how will people know where to get their test?"
2020-03-15,44:28,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, what is your plan to build more hospital beds so tens of thousand Americans don’t die, and how many more ventilators are you looking at ordering so people don’t suffocate?"
2020-03-15,44:38,Mike Pence,"Let me let the secretary step up. I know that there’s a longterm planning that takes place at HHS for those circumstances, and when I traveled to HHS yesterday, we reviewed all the numbers about stockpiles, everything from masks to ventilators to gowns. Mr. Secretary, you might just speak about capacity issues. And let me say it’s a very good question on your part. Right now our focus as the White House Coronavirus Task Force is to have widespread testing across the country using this new partnership with our commercial labs that the president has forged, and work with states to make those tests available. We’re also going to continue to work every single day to promote best practices for mitigation and working closely with and supporting state governments for decisions that they’re making on mitigation to prevent the spread. But the whole issue of personal protective equipment and supplies and the capacity of our healthcare system is in the forefront of what we’re talking about every day and the Secretary can address it."
2020-03-15,45:47,Alex Azar,"Thank you very much. First, being here at the podium, I just want to especially talk about the people in blue behind me. These are the leaders of United States Public Health Service Commission Corps that I am incredibly privileged to lead. Over 3000 of them, America’s public health warriors. Whether it’s going into the Eastern Congo or Western Africa to fight Ebola, or if it’s staffing the nursing home in Kirkland, being on the World Health Organization team in China, or helping to facilitate community based testing, these are America’s public health heroes. They rarely, in fact I doubt that there’s ever been a time in American history where the leadership of the Public Health Service Commission Corps had the privilege of standing here on this stage behind the President and Vice President of the United States. I just wanted to commend that."
2020-03-15,46:36,Alex Azar,"In terms of our capacities in our healthcare system, any pandemic like this runs the risk of exceeding our healthcare system capacity, and we must acknowledge that. That is precisely why the President and Vice President’s strategy is as Dr. Fauci has repeatedly spoke, to a delay and flatten the curve. The point of this is instead of a spike of the curve to delay and flatten that curve with the hope that you can keep the utilization of resources to be within the healthcare systems capacities. In addition to that, the entire point of our pandemic planning over the last 15 years has been to grant and put extra flex into our healthcare system. That’s why we have hospital preparedness grants that we fund every year through our preparedness program. That’s why we have in our strategic national stockpile, ventilators, field hospital units like mash units, if you’ll remember those, that have capacity for hundreds of individuals. In terms of supplies, obviously this is an unprecedented challenge. Unprecedented. And so we will work to increase the supplies of personal protective equipment, of ventilators, of field medical unit hospitals that we can deploy. We have tremendous supplies, but we want to acquire more. And that’s thanks to the bipartisan work of Congress funding the emergency supplemental that gives us the money to scale up production here and abroad. And we’re doing that."
2020-03-15,48:21,Alex Azar,"We don’t disclose concrete numbers on particular items for national security purposes, but we have many ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators in our system. We have received so far only, I think, one request for just several ventilators. One of the things in terms of hospital capacity that’s going to be really important, this is a really good learning from China that we got from the World Health Organization team that went there. Is if we have communities where we have enough capacity where we can put people who are positive with COVID-19 and have them be exclusively reserved for individuals who are positive for COVID-19, this reduces our need to try to protect patients from other patients because they’re all positive already."
2020-03-15,49:07,Alex Azar,"We need to protect our healthcare workers and our service workers in those facilities. This gives us reduced burden on personal protective equipment, but it also can give us greater capacity as we put field medical shelters up, as we consolidate into single facilities, as we don’t need individual rooms, negative airflow, isolation, et cetera. A vastly more efficient utilization of our healthcare system. This is all part of the planning work that we’ve done and are promulgating throughout our healthcare system. So that’s our strategy. We’re going to keep building that capacity though."
2020-03-15,49:37,Mike Pence,"Very good. Thank you, Mr. Secretary."
2020-03-15,49:38,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, [crosstalk 00:49:41] using the military?"
2020-03-15,49:42,Mike Pence,Go ahead.
2020-03-15,49:44,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr Vice President, you talked briefly about trying to make information more accessible online, so can you give us a time table for when you think a website will be available based on your conversations with Google? And secondly, and this might be to the broader team, can you also talk specifically about how many of these tests have been sent out to states and how many you still have to send out?"
2020-03-15,50:08,Mike Pence,"Well, let me say that we’re working with Google, but we’re working with many other tech companies and we’re truly grateful for the efforts of tech companies in disseminating best practices and guidance for citizens online all over the country today. Those resources are available in it. We literally heard not only from Google, but from Facebook and Amazon, and the public spiritedness that’s been reflected there is a credit to those great companies and a credit to all the dedicated Americans who worked there."
2020-03-15,50:43,Mike Pence,"Our best estimate, and literally the team has been working around the clock since Friday, is that at some point early in the week that we will have a website that goes up, the purpose of which will be for people to go and first fill out a questionnaire so that they can identify whether they fall in the category that Dr. Burks described would indicate the need to have a test. And then once they go through that questionnaire, then our objective is as more and more of these sites come online, run by state governments working in cooperation with our team, our public health service team, and FEMA, and also working in cooperation with local businesses and retailers, that people will know how to not only find it, but also the objective would be for them to literally be given a time that they can go and report for the test. But let me let the Admiral speak to the timing on the testing and unpack that for you."
2020-03-15,51:45,Brett Giroir,"So in our design, I just want to emphasize, we talk about testing and we talk about so many things, but we’re really talking people. And we’re trying to make this a very person centric experience to easily access the system, to give clear guidance about how to go, when to go, information that even if you’re not really indicated for testing, information you need to help protect yourself and your family. And then on the back end, very customized reporting. And we’re talking literally about having telephonic services to call individuals who’ve been tested, let them know yes, no, and what the next steps are."
2020-03-15,52:24,Brett Giroir,"So we’ve tried to really envision this through a patient experience. Now let me talk about the testing. Progressively over this week there will be rollout to different laboratories of approximately 1.9 million tests. There are many centralized laboratories, the behind the curtain that you never see after you give your blood. And you saw some of the CEOs in the Rose Garden last week like Quest and LabCorp that are fully able ready to run. They have been testing already, but fully able ready to run within the first part of this week, the very high throughput testing. The 2000 laboratories that are around the country that have a different platform, one that’s amenable to so many labs, not the big hugest highest output, but very high throughput laboratories, are progressing. They have to adapt the test slightly to their machines and get used to this. They will start lighting up Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I can’t give you the precise timeline except it has been an absolute priority of the laboratory associations of Thermo Fisher, the company that made this test, you heard the President predict that it might be approved within 24 hours on Friday. I think it was five hours after that in the middle of the night that the FDA approved that. And that’s the one that’s going to be widely disseminated, high throughput that’s going to be available."
2020-03-15,53:50,Brett Giroir,"So I know you want a specific time when these will light up progressively over the week. When that happens, there will be a centralized opportunity like in the Quest and the LabCorp. There will also be distributed opportunities like in all the major hospital systems and labs that are in your area. And then that number of 1.9 million goes up dramatically in the weeks coming forward. I’m not going to say that the lab testing issue is over because it’s not, it’s entering the next phase, but the much higher priority now is now that we have the testing available, how do we get people into the system to be tested in the appropriate prioritized way? And that’s what we’ve really been focused on. Information, website, points of distribution model that are tried and true, enabling the states, providing them with equipment, supplies, know how and Commission Corps officers as needed to help man these, or staff these, as we move forward. So you’ll see this rapidly developing over the week."
2020-03-15,54:50,Unnamed,"All right guys, last question."
2020-03-15,54:51,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, are you considering domestic travel restrictions, sir?"
2020-03-15,54:55,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, market futures are down despite the dramatic move from the fed that the President applauded, which suggests that there’s still concern that we haven’t done enough to respond to the economic impact of this deal… Or of the coronavirus. I’m wondering when specifically we’re going to hear from the White House about how you’re going help impacted industries from the airlines, the cruise ships? And secondly, I wanted to talk about the legislation that came out. The White House fought to exclude workers at larger corporations from paid sick leave. And so I’m wondering what you say to somebody who flips burgers at McDonald’s or works at one of these large chains that’s worried about staying home and potentially missing a paycheck?"
2020-03-15,55:41,Mike Pence,"Well first let me say we strongly support the House legislation, which while it gives some flexibility to small businesses, which will be reflected in the regulations going forward, no American workers should worry about missing a paycheck if they’re feeling ill. And we can’t say often enough to our fellow Americans, if you’re sick with a respiratory ailment, stay home. And as you’ve heard here today, over the course of this next week, we’re going to see testing become much more widely available beginning in the areas the CDC will focus us as the highest priority. But working with members of Congress, we’ve made sure that not only is testing free, but we have every confidence that the extension of paid and family leave to Americans will be extended in a way that will… Should give every American that confidence."
2020-03-15,56:46,Mike Pence,"And let me say with regard to the economy as a whole, I think the Treasury Secretary and then working very diligently on the President’s behalf, we have the supplemental eight point $3 billion bill. The House has now acted on important legislation that we fully support, and we hope the Senate takes it up this week. But whether it be the airline industry, or the cruise line industry, or the hotel industry, as the Secretary said recently, we are in just the first few innings of this effort. And the President has directed us to bring the full weight of the federal government to bear to confront this crisis, first and foremost on behalf of the health and safety and the American public, but strengthening our economy, ensuring that those vital industries will be able to find their way through and grow strongly once this coronavirus has passed will be a priority."
2020-03-15,57:43,Mike Pence,"And we’re already in discussions with members of Congress in both parties about that next phase of the support. But let me say as I close, we will be back in the morning tomorrow for a briefing, and also we’ll have a health briefing in the afternoon. But again, I know I speak on behalf of the President when I say how grateful we are for all the governors in the country, for all the local health officials, everyone that’s coming alongside Americans. We encourage every American to continue to use best practices and common sense. Even if you’re not in a high risk category, as the vast majority of Americans are, remember those people around you who may well be. Remember those seniors with underlying health conditions."
2020-03-15,58:36,Mike Pence,"It’s the reason why you need to keep washing your hands. You need to keep practicing good hygiene, cleaning those counters and surfaces to make sure that we don’t convey the coronavirus to them. And finally, let me add to all the wonderful accolades of the public health service personnel behind me. These are all heroes. And I have to tell you, having been over at HHS yesterday, having seen the way these people dropped everything and are rolling into this effort to expand testing across the country, it’ll be these people in these blue uniforms that you see at an awful lot of these points of distribution, these community centers around the country. And for all they’re doing today, for all each one of them done throughout their career. I know they have the thanks of this President, his Vice President, and the American people. Thank you."
2020-03-16,09:24,Donald Trump,"I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing. That looks very nice. That’s very good. I want to thank everybody for being here today. This morning I spoke with the leaders of the G seven, G seven nations and they really had a good meeting. I think it was a very, very productive meeting. I also spoke with our nation’s governors, and this afternoon we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus. We did this today. This was done by a lot of very talented people, some of whom were standing with me, and that’s available."
2020-03-16,10:16,Donald Trump,"Dr. Birx will be speaking about that in just a few minutes. It’s important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm’s way. We especially worry about our senior citizens. The White House task force meets every day and continually updates guidelines based on the fast evolving situation that this has become all over the world. It’s all over the world. It’s incredible what’s happened in such a short period of time. On the guidelines of the task force, the new modeling conducted by Dr. Birx and our consultation with governors, we’ve made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it and that’s what we are. Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people."
2020-03-16,11:21,Donald Trump,"Avoid discretionary travel and avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts. If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly and a lot of progress has been made. I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history, not even close. We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments and we’ve had some promising results, early results, but promising to reduce the severity and the duration of the symptoms. And I have to say that our government is prepared to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes we’re doing, and we’re doing it in every way. And with that I’d like to just introduce Dr. Birx, Who’s going to discuss some of the things that we strongly recommend. Thank you."
2020-03-16,12:35,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. President. I think you know, over the last months we’ve taken very bold action to stop the virus from coming to our shores. And because of that, we gained time to really get together and understand the progress across the globe of what has worked and what hasn’t worked. We now need to appeal to every single American so that they can have their role in stopping the spread of this virus. We’ve talked about things before about washing your hands, but we really want to focus on if you are sick, no matter who you are, please stay home. If someone in your household is diagnosed with this virus, the entire household should quarantine in the house to prevent spread of the virus to others. The reason we’re taking these strong and bold steps is because we know there is virus spread before you develop symptoms, and then we know that there’s a large group, we don’t know the precise percent yet that actually is asymptomatic or has such mild cases that they continue to spread the virus."
2020-03-16,13:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,"If your children are sick, please keep them home. Now, to our older population or those with preexisting medical conditions. Everyone in the household needs to focus on protecting them. Everyone in the household. I want to speak particularly to our largest generation now, our millennials. I am the mom of two wonderful millennial young women who are bright and hardworking and I will tell you what I told to them. They are the core group that will stop this virus. They are the group that communicates successfully, independent of picking up a phone. They intuitively know how to contact each others without being in large social gatherings. We’re asking all of them to hold their gatherings to under 10 people. Not just in bars and restaurants, but in homes."
2020-03-16,14:40,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We really want people to be separated at this time, to be able to address this virus as comprehensively that we cannot see, for we don’t have a vaccine or a therapeutic. The only thing we have right now is the amazing ingenuity and compassion of the American people. We’re appealing to all Americans to take these steps to protect each other and to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread. These guidelines are very specific. They’re very detailed. They will only work if every American takes this together to heart and responds as one nation and one people to stop the spread of this virus. Thank you."
2020-03-16,15:25,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much Dr. Birx. So just to connect with what I mentioned to you in previous discussions in this room, and Dr. Birx said it very well. That in order to be able to contain and curtail this epidemic to not reach its maximum capability, we have a two pillar approach. One of which I believe has been very effective in preventing the substantial seating and namely the travel restrictions that we’ve discussed many times in this room. The other equally, if not more important is when you have infection in your own country, which we do, and I can read the numbers, but they’re really essentially what we’ve seen yesterday. Incremental increases both globally as well as in the United States, but the curve doing that. So therefore the kinds of things that we do are containment and mitigation. This what we’re mentioning now, the guidelines when you look at them carefully, I believe if the people in the United States take them seriously because they were based on some rather serious consideration back and forth, some may look at them and say they’re going to be really inconvenient for people."
2020-03-16,16:44,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Some will look and say, well, maybe we’ve gone a little bit too far. They were well thought out, and the thing that I want to reemphasize, and I will say it over and over again, when you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are. That’s not word speak. It means if you think you’re here, you’re really here because you’re only getting the results. Therefore it will always seem that the best way to address it would to be doing something that looks like it might be an overreaction. It isn’t an overreaction. It’s a reaction that we feel is commensurate, which is actually going on in reality. So take a look at the guidelines, read them carefully and we hope that the people of the United States will take them very seriously because they will fail if people don’t adhere to them. We have to have, as a whole country, cooperate and to make sure these get done. Thank you."
2020-03-16,17:53,Donald Trump,"Okay, go ahead."
2020-03-16,17:54,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:17:55]. Mr. President, a lot of people are concerned about how long all of this might last. Do you have any kind of estimate that if Americans really were to band together and do what the White House is suggesting, how quickly you could turn this corner?"
2020-03-16,18:09,Donald Trump,"My favorite question, I ask it all the time, how many times Anthony? I think I ask him that question every day and I speak to Debra, I speak to a lot of them. I get the opinion. So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that is a much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August, something like that. So it could be right in that period of time where I say it washes through, other people don’t like that term, but it washes through."
2020-03-16,18:50,Unnamed,Is the new normal until the height of the summer?
2020-03-16,18:53,Donald Trump,"We’ll see what happens. But they think August, could be July. It could be longer than that. But I’ve asked that question many, many times. Yes?"
2020-03-16,19:00,Unnamed,"With that being said, Mr. President, Americans today and looking forward are living with so much anxiety and so much fear facing uncertainty right now. I’m curious, how are you talking to your own family about this? How are you talking to your youngest son? Do you empathize with this sense of anxiety? People are really scared."
2020-03-16,19:20,Donald Trump,"I think they are very scared. I think they see that we’re doing a very professional job. We’ve been working with the governors and the frankly, the mayors, local government at every level. We have FEMA totally involved. FEMA has been … Usually we see FEMA for the hurricanes and the tornadoes. Now we have FEMA involved in this. They’ve been doing a fantastic job locally, working with people that they know because they work, like as an example, in California, in the state of Washington, they work with them a lot on other things and they’re very familiar, so they’re working on it. What you can do and all you can do is professional, totally competent. We have the best people in the world. We have really the greatest experts in the world and someday soon hopefully it’ll end and we’ll be back to where it was, but this came up … We came up so suddenly look, you were surprised. We were all surprised. We heard about it."
2020-03-16,20:14,Donald Trump,"We heard about reports from China that something was happening and all of a sudden we did make a good decision. We closed our borders to China very quickly, very rapidly. That was … Otherwise we’d be in a very, as Tony has said numerous times, we’d be in a very bad position, much worse than we would be right now. You’re looking at what’s happening in other countries. Italy is having a very hard time, but I think that what we do, and I’ve spoken actually with my son, he says, “How bad is this?” It’s bad. It’s bad, but we’re going to, we’re going to be hopefully a case not a worst case and that’s what we’re working for. Yes?"
2020-03-16,20:49,Unnamed,"You can clear up some confusion on two key fronts. One is about your own tests. The other was about containment efforts. Is the administration considering more aggressive containment options like a quarantine, a national curfew [crosstalk 00:21:03]?"
2020-03-16,21:03,Donald Trump,"Well, we have that very much. Yeah, we have that very much and we are … We’ve been pretty aggressive. We were early with Europe but we were very, very early with China and other places and fortunately we were. And as far as containment here, we are. We’re coming out with strong suggestions and it’s becoming a little bit automatic. You look at people, they’re not doing certain things. For instance, obviously not … I wouldn’t say the restaurant business is booming and bars and grills and all. People are self- containing for to a large extent. We look forward to the day when we can get back to normal. What’s your second question?"
2020-03-16,21:38,Unnamed,"Are you considering instituting a nationwide lockdown, a nationwide quarantine? The NSC knocked that down, but there’s still some questions about how it all [crosstalk 00:21:47]."
2020-03-16,21:46,Donald Trump,"At this point, not nationwide, but, well, there was some point … Some places in our nation that are not very effected at all, but we may look at certain areas, certain hotspots, as they call them. We’ll be looking at that, but at this moment, no, we’re not."
2020-03-16,22:03,Donald Trump,"… call them. We’ll be looking at that. But at this moment, no, we’re not."
2020-03-16,22:03,Unnamed,The second question is you said you had your coronavirus test Friday night. The White House doctor’s office put out a statement around midnight Friday saying that no test was indicated. When exactly was your test administered to you?
2020-03-16,22:14,Donald Trump,"I had my test. It was late Friday night. The reason I did it was because the … I had no symptoms whatsoever. The doctor said, “You have no symptoms so we don’t see any reason.” But when I did the press conference on Friday, everybody was going crazy. “Did you do the test? Did you do the test?” Very late on Friday night I did the test. The doctor may have put out something. I don’t know what time the letter went out. Maybe it was put out by somebody else, but the results came back I believe the following day. We tested negative."
2020-03-16,22:47,Unnamed,"But the question is, how could the White House doctor’s office say a test wasn’t indicated implying that you hadn’t had one when in fact you had tested?"
2020-03-16,22:53,Donald Trump,"I told them that and I went totally by what they said, the doctors, more than one. They said you don’t have any of the symptoms. They checked what you’re supposed to check and that I didn’t have symptoms, but I did a test late on Friday night. It came back probably 24 hours later or something. They sent it to the labs. It came back later. Yeah, please."
2020-03-16,23:13,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you had a teleconference with the nation’s governors today. In that teleconference you told them if they need things like respirators or masks to try to get it on their own. What did you mean by that? What will the federal government do to help them?"
2020-03-16,23:25,Donald Trump,"If they can get them faster by getting them on their own, in other words, go through a supply chain that they may have. Because the governors during normal times, the governors buy a lot of things, not necessarily through federal government. If they’re able to get ventilators, respirators, if they’re able to get certain things without having to go through the longer process of federal government."
2020-03-16,23:45,Donald Trump,"We have stockpiles now where we’re ordering tremendous numbers of ventilators, respirators, masks, and they’re ordered. They’re coming. We have quite a few at this point. I think, Mike, we have a lot. But if they can get them directly, it’s always going to be faster if they could get them directly if they need them. I’ve given them authorization to order directly."
2020-03-16,24:07,Unnamed,"Mr. President, one of the big weaknesses in our healthcare system is surge capacity for medical facilities."
2020-03-16,24:15,Donald Trump,That’s right.
2020-03-16,24:15,Unnamed,"I wanted to ask what precautions, what planning is being done to get … China was able to build hospitals in a matter of days. Are you prepared to use the Corps of Engineers or FEMA to start building the surge capacity that we may need in a couple of weeks?"
2020-03-16,24:33,Donald Trump,"First of all, we hope we don’t get there. That’s what we’re doing. That’s why we’re taking a very strict look at this. But we also are looking at areas and not only looking, we’re expanding certain areas. We’re taking over buildings that aren’t used. We’re doing a lot in that regard. We hope we don’t have to get there, but we are doing a lot in that regard."
2020-03-16,24:52,Unnamed,"Mr. President, can you clarify something? These guidelines say, “Stay home if you’re sick.” Yesterday the Vice President said, “No one should worry about losing a paycheck if they stay home when they’re sick.” But the House bill exempts companies of 500 employees or more from the paid sick leave requirement. That’s 54% of the American workplace. Why is it a good idea to only require small businesses to provide paid sick leave?"
2020-03-16,25:16,Donald Trump,We’re looking at that and we may be expanding that. We are looking at that.
2020-03-16,25:19,Unnamed,Do you then want to add big companies?
2020-03-16,25:19,Donald Trump,"We want fairness. We want it for everybody. No, we’re looking at that through the Senate, because as you know the Senate is now digesting that bill."
2020-03-16,25:26,Unnamed,Do you then want them to add big companies?
2020-03-16,25:26,Donald Trump,We may very well be adding something on that. Good question.
2020-03-16,25:29,Unnamed,"Two questions here, Mr. President. One going off of what he was asking. How many ventilators and how many ICU beds do we have right now and will it be enough?"
2020-03-16,25:38,Donald Trump,"I could get back to you with that number. We’ve ordered a lot. We have quite a few, but it may not be enough. If it’s not enough, we will have it by the time we need it. Hopefully we won’t need them."
2020-03-16,25:47,Unnamed,And you’ll give us the exact number?
2020-03-16,25:48,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we’ll be able to give you-"
2020-03-16,25:51,Unnamed,Because so far they have not given us an exact number.
2020-03-16,25:51,Donald Trump,"We can give you a number. If it’s important, we’ll give you a number. Go ahead."
2020-03-16,25:53,Unnamed,"Yesterday you said that this was, “Under tremendous control.” Do you want to revisit that statement if we are going to be experiencing this until July or August, five more months ahead of right where we are now?"
2020-03-16,26:05,Donald Trump,"When I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with. We’re doing a very good job. There’s been a tremendous amount of the way they’re working together. They’re working hand-in-hand. I think they’re doing really a great job. From that standpoint, that’s what I was referring to yesterday. Yeah, Steve, go ahead."
2020-03-16,26:26,Unnamed,"You not saying, “It’s under control,” right?"
2020-03-16,26:27,Donald Trump,I’m not referring to it. Meaning the-
2020-03-16,26:30,Unnamed,Coronavirus.
2020-03-16,26:30,Donald Trump,"Yeah, if you’re talking about the virus, no. That’s not under control for any place in the world. I think I read-"
2020-03-16,26:35,Unnamed,Yesterday you had said it was.
2020-03-16,26:35,Donald Trump,"I think I read … no, I didn’t. I was talking about what we’re doing is under control, but I’m not talking about the virus."
2020-03-16,26:40,Donald Trump,"Yes, please."
2020-03-16,26:41,Steve (Reporter),The stock market took another hit today. Is the US economy heading into a recession?
2020-03-16,26:46,Donald Trump,"Well, it may be. We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus. Once we stop I think there’s a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market, in terms of the economy. Once this goes away, once it goes through and we’re done with it, I think you’re going to see a tremendous, a tremendous surge."
2020-03-16,27:03,Steve (Reporter),"Are you looking at any domestic travel restrictions? I know that’s been on the table before, but is that firming up at all?"
2020-03-16,27:10,Donald Trump,"We’re not really. We hope we don’t have to, Steve. We think that hopefully we won’t have to do that. But it’s certainly something that we talk about every day. We haven’t made that decision."
2020-03-16,27:21,Unnamed,"Mr. President, can I ask you, doctors and nurses in this country are telling us across the board that they’re terrified of this virus, of the fact that they can get it, or the fact that they might take it home to their families. What can you say to assure healthcare providers in this country that the federal government is doing something today to ensure that they get personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their family?"
2020-03-16,27:40,Donald Trump,"I think the federal government’s doing everything that we can possibly do. We made some very good early decisions by keeping people out, by keeping countries out, certain countries where the infection was very immense. I noticed a lot of people are talking about South Korea because they’ve a good job on one side, but on the other side, tremendous problems at the beginning. They had tremendous problems and great numbers of death. I think that we’ve done a fantastic job from just about every standpoint."
2020-03-16,28:09,Donald Trump,"With that being said, no matter where you look, this is something. It’s an invisible enemy. But we are speaking all the time, not only with the people, but also the professional people, the nurses, the doctors, they have been doing a fantastic job. We are also working very much on getting them the kind of equipment that they need. For the most part, they either have it or they will be getting it."
2020-03-16,28:33,Donald Trump,"But remember this, we want the governors, we want the mayors, we want them locally, from a local standpoint because it can go quicker, we want them to work. We had a great talk with the governors today. I think it was a really great talk. There’s a tremendous coordination. There’s a tremendous spirit that we have together with the governors. That’s pretty much for the most part, bipartisan. Yeah."
2020-03-16,28:54,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you told John that you think this could wash through, as you said, July, August. You just told Steve when he asked you about the possibility of a recession, you said, “It may be.” I’m curious if there is a recession, when do you think that might hit?"
2020-03-16,29:09,Donald Trump,"I don’t number one determine recession. I just say this. We have an invisible enemy. We have a problem that a month ago nobody ever thought about. I’ve read about it. I read about many years ago, 1917, 1918. I’ve seen all of the different problems similar to this that we’ve had. This is a bad one. This is a very bad one. This is bad in the sense that it’s so contagious. It’s just so contagious, sort of a record setting-type contagion. The good part is the young people they do very well and healthy people do very well. Very, very bad for older people, especially older people with problems. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything else is going to fall into place. Yes, please."
2020-03-16,30:08,Unnamed,"Mr. President, there were a lot of rumors last night that you were going to put in a national curfew or some kind of texting stuff."
2020-03-16,30:17,Donald Trump,I’ve been watching.
2020-03-16,30:18,Unnamed,"Right, exactly. Me too. Your people were saying this is a foreign disinformation campaign, is that what’s going on? Are people messing with us on the internet?"
2020-03-16,30:25,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. That I can’t tell you if they are or not. I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair. I think people are pulling together on this. I really think the media has been very fair. I think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games, but it doesn’t matter. We haven’t really determined to do that at all and hopefully we won’t have to. That’s a very big step. It’s a step we can take, but we have not decided to do it. Jennifer, go."
2020-03-16,30:53,Jennifer,"Mr. President, two things, one on airlines and one on Jeff Bezos. Can you talk a little bit specifically about what you’d like to do to help the airlines first of all? Then second of all, we heard that Jeff Bezos has been in contact with the White House daily. Can you say what he’s been asking for or proposing to do?"
2020-03-16,31:07,Donald Trump,"I’ve heard that’s true. I don’t know that for a fact, but I know that some of my people have, as I understand it, have been dealing with them or with him. That’s nice. We’ve had tremendous support from a lot of people that can help. I believe he was one of them."
2020-03-16,31:23,Donald Trump,"As far as the airlines are concerned, were going to back the airlines 100%. it’s not their fault. It’s nobody’s fault unless you go to the original source, but it’s nobody’s fault. We’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much. We’ve told the airlines we’re going to help them."
2020-03-16,31:41,John (Reporter),They want $25 billion dollars.
2020-03-16,31:42,Donald Trump,"We’re going to be helping. We’re going to be backstopping the airlines. We’re going to be helping them very much, John. It’s very important."
2020-03-16,31:47,Unnamed,"What will you do about the stock market, sir?"
2020-03-16,31:49,John (Reporter),The $25 billion dollars for the passenger carriers and $4 billion for cargo?
2020-03-16,31:53,Donald Trump,"We’re going to be looking at it very strongly. We have to back the airlines. It’s not their fault. In fact, they were having a record season. Everybody was. They were having record seasons. Then this came out and it came out from nowhere. Not their fault, but we’re going to be back the airline. Yeah."
2020-03-16,32:08,Unnamed,Stocks continue to fall today. Would the White House support negative rates?
2020-03-16,32:11,Donald Trump,"Best thing I can do for the stock market is we have to get through this crisis. That’s what I can do. That’s the best thing we can do. That’s what I think about. Once this virus has gone, I think you’re going to have a stock market like nobody’s ever seen before."
2020-03-16,32:24,Mike Pence,[inaudible 00:32:26].
2020-03-16,32:24,Donald Trump,"Oh, okay."
2020-03-16,32:24,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-16,32:24,Unnamed,"Will people be voting tomorrow, Mr. President?"
2020-03-16,32:31,Unnamed,"Mr. President, the other day-"
2020-03-16,32:32,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"He’ll be back in a sec. He’ll be back in a second. I think that the question that I think maybe John asked about until July, the guidelines are a 15-day trial guideline to be reconsidering. It isn’t that these guidelines are now going to be in effect until July. What the President was saying is that the trajectory of the outbreak may go till then. Make sure we don’t think that these are solid in stone until July."
2020-03-16,32:56,Donald Trump,Yeah. That would be the outside number.
2020-03-16,33:00,Unnamed,Mr. President-
2020-03-16,33:01,Donald Trump,"Hold on one second. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-16,33:02,Unnamed,To follow up. Do you want Senate Republicans to change the package that had passed the House last week even though you [crosstalk 00:33:11]-
2020-03-16,33:11,Donald Trump,"I think they may make it even better. Look, they’re working together very well with the House. They are working very much in unison, like the question before. They’re working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody. That’s what we’re looking to do. We may go back and forth with the House a little bit, but both will be in a very positive fashion. Please."
2020-03-16,33:33,Unnamed,"Mr. President, these new guidelines say avoid social gatherings and groups of more than 10 people. The CDC’s recommendations yesterday were for people to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people. What’s evolved in you and your team’s thinking in just the past 24 hours. Also, what exactly do you need to see in a stimulus bill?"
2020-03-16,33:54,Donald Trump,Let me just have the professionals answer that. Would you like to do that? Please.
2020-03-16,33:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Great. Thank you and thank you for that question. We have been working on models day and night around the globe to really predict. Because some countries are in a very early stage like the United States. We’ve been working with groups in the United Kingdom. We had new information coming out from a model and what had the biggest impact in the model is social distancing, small groups, not going in public in large groups. But the most important thing was if one person in the household became infected, the whole household self-quarantined for 14 days, because that stops 100% of the transmission outside of the household."
2020-03-16,34:40,Dr. Deborah Birx,"As we talked about early on, it’s silent. We had another silent epidemic, HIV. I just want to recognize the HIV epidemic was solved by the community. The HIV advocates and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone’s attention. We’re asking that same sense of community to come together and stand up against this virus. If everybody in America does what we ask for over the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference and we won’t have to worry about the ventilators. We won’t have to worry about the ICU beds because we won’t have our elderly and our people at the greatest risk having to be hospitalized."
2020-03-16,35:21,Unnamed,"Excuse me, Dr. Birx. Can we ask for a comment on the [crosstalk 00:13:24], Doctor?"
2020-03-16,35:26,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, Yes, Mike."
2020-03-16,35:28,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. Very productive call today with governors. We talked about the new rollout of testing that we described yesterday and drive-thru and community-based testing. I know how grateful the President is for the efforts that our governors are making and now with the Admiral and the United States Public Health Service as well as FEMA. We’ve made great progress today in coordinating those efforts."
2020-03-16,35:59,Mike Pence,But the other issue that was raised with the President today was personal protective equipment. The reason I mentioned testing is because one of the recommendations that we have for states is that these remote testing sites make a priority of two groups. One would be people over the age of 65 that have symptoms. We don’t want them to go to hospitals or emergency rooms. We want them to go to a remote site in a parking lot or at a isolated community location.
2020-03-16,36:27,Mike Pence,"But the other category is our healthcare workers. We want to make sure that our healthcare workers have the opportunity to be tested and using that new high throughput test that the President arranged with our major commercial labs, we’ll be able to do that much more expeditiously. We’re putting a real priority on our extraordinary health care workers that are at this very hour coming alongside that are struggling with the coronavirus and people that are concerned that they may have been exposed."
2020-03-16,36:56,Mike Pence,"The other piece is we’re grateful that the legislation passed by the House of Representatives includes liability protection for N95 masks produced by companies like 3M in Minnesota, by Honeywell. Literally tens of millions of masks are produced every year for industrial purposes for construction, but the health experts say they can be used just as readily to protect healthcare workers from respiratory ailments. 3M and other companies were not able to sell those to hospitals, but the President negotiated with the Democratic leadership of the House and Senate. We’ve added a provision to the bill that will literally from one company alone add another 30 million masks per month back to the marketplace."
2020-03-16,37:41,Mike Pence,We’re strengthening the supply chain and healthcare workers around America can be absolutely certain that the President and our entire team are going to continue to put the health of America first and put first our healthcare workers across this country that are meeting the needs of the people of our country.
2020-03-16,37:58,Unnamed,Mr. Vice President?
2020-03-16,37:58,Donald Trump,"Admiral, perhaps you could-"
2020-03-16,38:01,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, how many test kits have been sent out and how many people can actually be tested?"
2020-03-16,38:05,Donald Trump,I think the admiral can answer that and you might want to talk about the roving also.
2020-03-16,38:11,Brett Giroir,"Thank you very much for that. As we talked about yesterday, we’re really entering a new phase of testing. At first we were at the initial phase where the CDC-developed test was only available in public health laboratories and the CDC. Works very well for a few thousand tests per day after it gets running. We’re now moving into a phase that the big commercial laboratories with high throughput screening have availability. As we talked about last week, because of the historic efforts of the FDA Roche test, and as the President predicted, a Thermo Fisher test were both produced last week under an emergency use authorization. 1.9 million of those tests will be sequentially into the ecosystem this week."
2020-03-16,38:59,Brett Giroir,"From the information we have right now, 1 million tests are available with all the reagents, everything ready to go, primarily at the reference labs called Quest, LabCorp and a couple others. Now it doesn’t matter if they are not in your neighborhood because every day when people get tests, a little white box goes out in front, it gets shipped by an incredible distribution system, the test result, and it’s electronically reported. These are available to people nationwide."
2020-03-16,39:27,Brett Giroir,"We expect more and more than 1 million coming onboard this week as the reagents come up and as people with the testing capacity validate that in their own hospitals and other places. In the future, we expect at least 2 million next week and at least 5 million the week thereafter. There are also a whole growth of what’s called laboratory-determined testing or laboratory-derived testing where individual laboratories because of the regulatory deregulation of the FDA, can develop their own tests and start using them. If you’re a CLIA-certified lab with complexity, you can do that."
2020-03-16,40:06,Brett Giroir,The point is testing is now entering sort of what we normally do in the healthcare system where big labs in a high throughput basis receive these through normal channels. That part of that is really underway.
2020-03-16,40:20,Unnamed,"But, do you know how many Americans have actually been tested? Do you have a number?"
2020-03-16,40:25,Brett Giroir,There is a number. I don’t have that number because I’ve been working on setting up this distribution system. This is where we are. The state and public health laboratories and the CDC are published everyday on the CDC website. The CDC gets feeds from LabCorp and Quest. They get that on a daily basis. What is not being received right now and Ambassador Birx is fixing is that these homegrown tests in highly complex labs don’t necessarily get reported in the system.
2020-03-16,40:56,Brett Giroir,"However, as we move forward, particularly in the height, in the commercial phase of where we are right now, we expect about 80% to 85% of the tests to flow right into the CDC. We know them. That’s not good enough for Ambassador Birx. She wants a 100% and we’ll work on that."
2020-03-16,41:14,Donald Trump,"I think just to put it a different way, a lot of testing has been going on. I don’t believe anybody has been able to do what we’re doing and what we will be doing."
2020-03-16,41:23,Brett Giroir,Let me just say that we talked about the drive-thru testing yesterday. I want it to be clear to everybody. This is just another tool for states and local public health systems and healthcare systems to use. It’s not replacing testing that goes on in a doctor’s office or in a hospital or if you go to your doctor and want to get tested in that office. This is just another tool that we’re helping the states to have.
2020-03-16,41:46,Brett Giroir,"Again as we talked about, this is modeled on the FEMA-based points of distribution system optimized for testing. We expect this week, we now have gear, people being shipped right now, today that will be in over 12 states with multiple sites, many of states having multiple sites to start augmenting the local capacity and really providing the state and the local people what they need as another way for people to get tested."
2020-03-16,42:20,Donald Trump,"This has never been done before. That’s never been done and certainly not on a level like that. I will say that I think I can speak for the professionals that if you don’t have the symptoms, if your doctor doesn’t think you need it, don’t get the test. Don’t get the test. I think that’s very important. Not everybody should run out and get the test, but we’re able to handle tremendous numbers of people."
2020-03-16,42:43,Donald Trump,John?
2020-03-16,42:43,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, earlier today Governor Cuomo of New York said that he believes that hospital capacity soon will be overwhelmed and implored you to call on the Army Corps of Engineers to build temporary facilities to house patients. Is that something [crosstalk 00:42:59]-"
2020-03-16,42:59,Donald Trump,"We’re looking into it. We’ve heard that. We’ve heard it from really two places. There are two places that have specifically, New York being one. We are looking into it very strongly. Yeah."
2020-03-16,43:11,Donald Trump,"Steve, go ahead please."
2020-03-16,43:12,Steve (Reporter),"Sir, how have you changed your own behavior to take account of this virus? Are you washing your hands more?"
2020-03-16,43:18,Donald Trump,"I’ve always washed my hands a lot. I wash my hands a lot. Maybe, if anything, more, certainly not less."
2020-03-16,43:27,Unnamed,What was it like taking the test?
2020-03-16,43:28,Donald Trump,"Not something I want to do every day. I can tell you that. It’s a little bit of … good doctors in the White House, but it’s a test. It’s a test. It’s a medical test. Nothing pleasant about it."
2020-03-16,43:42,Unnamed,You said that in a Tweet that Governor Cuomo should be doing more.
2020-03-16,43:53,Donald Trump,I think he can do more.
2020-03-16,43:54,Unnamed,What specifically should he be doing if he can?
2020-03-16,43:55,Donald Trump,"I think he can do more. It’s an area of the country that’s very hot right now. I think New Rochelle, a place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle."
2020-03-16,44:02,Donald Trump,"Place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle. I think it’s a very, no I think it’s an area that has to be tamped down even more. Because it’s a hotbed. There’s no question about it. So I think they could look at doing it. But we’re getting along very well. We’ve had a very, in fact, I noticed he made some statements just now that the relationship with the federal government has been good. That federal government has done everything they’ve wanted us to do."
2020-03-16,44:25,Donald Trump,"But we can, I think it’s very important that all of the governors get along very well with us. And that we get along with the governors and I think that’s happening."
2020-03-16,44:33,Group,[crosstalk 00:44:39].
2020-03-16,44:33,Unnamed,The Defense Secretary and the Assistant Defense Secretary decided to separate and be in a bubble to avoid the spread of the disease and to protect the chain of command. Is that something you and the Vice President should be doing? And has there been any talk about having to have a 25th Amendment procedure in place?
2020-03-16,44:52,Donald Trump,"Well, we haven’t thought of it. But you know, I will say this, we’re very careful. We’re very careful with being together. Even the people behind me they’ve been very strongly tested. I’ve been very strongly tested and we have to be very careful. But everybody should be very vigilant. We have to be vigilant. Yeah please."
2020-03-16,45:20,Group,[crosstalk 00:45:18].
2020-03-16,45:20,Donald Trump,Go ahead please.
2020-03-16,45:20,Unnamed,Two simple questions for you Mr. President.
2020-03-16,45:20,Donald Trump,"Hold it, hold it. Before you."
2020-03-16,45:21,Unnamed,"Okay. I don’t know if this is a question for you or Dr. Birx. But Dr. Birx said that it is the millennials who are going to lead us through this and that now is the time to look out for the older people in our home. Older might be a state of mind, not necessarily an age. So for those millennials of us who have parents who are in their fifties, sixties, seventies what is older? What should we tell them at this point?"
2020-03-16,45:48,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, if I was Dr. Fauci I would tell you there’s a physiologic age and a numerical age. So older people with preexisting conditions. And what do we mean by that? Significant heart disease, significant kidney disease, significant lung disease, any immunosuppression, any recent treatment for cancer. Any of those pieces on any household."
2020-03-16,46:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,Now why do I think the millennials are the key? Because they’re the ones that are out. And about and they’re the most likely to be in social gatherings. And they’re the most likely to be the least symptomatic. And I think we’ve always heard about the greatest generation. We’re protecting the greatest generation right now and the children are the greatest generation.
2020-03-16,46:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,And I think the millennials can help us tremendously by having… plus they need to communicate with each other. Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25 to 35 year old may find interesting and something that they’ll take to heart. But millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.
2020-03-16,47:01,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Now you could be 40 and have a significant medical condition and be a substantial risk. You could be 30 and having come through Hodgkin’s Disease or Non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma and be of a significant risk. So there are risk groups in every age group, but there’s more millennials now than any other cohort. And they can help us at this moment."
2020-03-16,47:23,Group,[crosstalk 00:47:28].
2020-03-16,47:23,Unnamed,"Thank you very much. [crosstalk 00:47:28] Thank you very much. Mr president, you already talked. Mr. President the other day you said that you were not responsible for the testing shortfall. Very simple question. Does the buck stop with you? And on a scale of one to 10 how would you rate your response to this crisis?"
2020-03-16,47:42,Donald Trump,"I’d rate it a ten. I think we’ve done a great job. And it started with the fact that we kept a very highly infected country despite, even the professionals saying, “No, it’s too early to do that.” We were very, very early with respect to China. And we would have a whole different situation in this country. If we didn’t do that. I would rate ourselves and the professional. I think the professionals have done a fantastic job."
2020-03-16,48:10,Donald Trump,"As far as the testing. You heard the Admiral, I think the testing that we’ve done. We really took over an obsolete system. Or put it maybe in a different way, a system that wasn’t meant to do anything like this. We took it over and we’re doing something that’s never been done in this country. And I think that we are doing very well. We took the system, we worked with the system we had and we broke down the system purposely. We broke it down in order to do what we’re doing now. And within a short period of time and even now we’re testing tremendous numbers of people. And ultimately you’re saying, it will be what? It will be up to how many people will be able to test?"
2020-03-16,48:48,Brett Giroir,"We certainly expect with the high throughput testing that that’s no longer a barrier. The barrier is actually doing the test on a person. And I’m sure as the president would inform you in order to do the test, a healthcare provider needs to dress in full personal protective equipment, full personal protective equipment. And there’s a swab that’s put in the back of the nose all the way to the back of the throat. It’s called a nasal pharyngeal swab, which is then put in media. The next person who has to get tested, that healthcare provider has to change all the personal protective equipment. When you put that in, it’s highly likely a person coughs or sneezes so you’re at risk. So that’s what we’re trying to fix now by the mobile platforms, by all the things we’re doing is to enable high throughput of this swabbing. And we’re doing some technological things too that might be breakthroughs to make it much, much faster. But we certainly expect that from thousands of people per day we will be at the tens of thousands of people per day this week according to those who are [inaudible 00:49:51]"
2020-03-16,49:51,Unnamed,"Does the buck stop with you, Mr president? Does the buck stop with you?"
2020-03-16,49:54,Donald Trump,"Yeah, normally. But I think when you hear the, “This has never been done before in this country.” If you look back take a look at some of the things that took place in ’09 or ’11 or whatever it may have been nobody’s ever done anything like what we’re doing. Now. I will also say Admiral, I think we can say that we’re also getting this ready for the future. So that when we have a future problem, if and when, and hopefully we don’t have anything like this. But if there is, we’re going to be starting off from a much higher plateau. Because we were at a very, very low base. We had a system that was not meant for this. It was a smaller system. It was meant for a much different purpose and for that purpose it was fine. But not for this purpose. So we broke down the system and now we have something that’s going to be and is very special and is ready for future problems. I think we can say that very strongly. Yeah."

2020-03-16,50:47,Donald Trump,Go ahead please.
2020-03-16,50:51,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. President. How close are you to shutting down America’s northern border with Canada? And could you also speak to the fact about the elections that are supposed to be taking place tomorrow? Is it your advice that those states postpone those elections?
2020-03-16,51:06,Donald Trump,"Well, I’d leave that up to the states. It’s a big thing. Postponing an election. I think to me that really goes to the heart of what we’re all about. I think postponing and elections is a very tough thing I know they’re doing, because they’ve been in touch with us, they’re doing it very carefully. They’re spreading people out at great distances as you can see. And I think they’ll do it very safely. I hope they do it very safely, but I think postponing elections is not a very good thing. They have lots of room and a lot of the electoral places. And I think that they will do it very well, but I think postponing is unnecessary."
2020-03-16,51:40,Unnamed,"On the Norther border, sir? How close are you to shutting it down. [crosstalk 00:51:43]"
2020-03-16,51:43,Donald Trump,"We think about it. We think about it. If we don’t have to do it, that’ll be good. We have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the Southern and the Northern borders. And we are talking about different things, but we’ll see. Right now we have not decided to do that. Steve."
2020-03-16,51:57,Steve (Reporter),Sir are we getting Dr.Fauci to talk about the vaccine trial today? And whether the timetable for vaccine is it possible accelerate? Are is it still 12-18 months?
2020-03-16,52:08,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you for that question. The vaccine candidate that was given the first injection for the first person took place today. You might recall when we first started, I said it would be two to three months. And if we did that, that would be the fastest we’ve ever gone from obtaining the sequence to being able to do a phase one trial."
2020-03-16,52:27,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"This has been now 65 days, which I believe is the record. What it is, it’s a trial of 45 normal individuals between the ages of 18 and 55. The trial is taking place in Seattle. There will be two injections, one at zero day, first one, then 28 days. There will be three separate doses, 25 milligrams, 100 milligrams, 250 milligrams. And the individuals will be followed for one year. Both for safety and whether it induces the kind of response that we predict would be protective. And that’s exactly what I’ve been telling this group over and over again. So it’s happened. The first injection was today."

2020-03-16,53:09,Unnamed,"Sir the market just closed down 3000, almost 13%. Your response to the market close sir?"
2020-03-16,53:13,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:53:13] Pregnancy. Is pregnancy an underlying condition?
2020-03-16,53:13,Donald Trump,Go ahead please.
2020-03-16,53:13,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci is there guidance for someone who may have felt sick but then feels better? So you had symptoms but you no longer do, your fever is gone away. How long would you stay home after that point? That’s not clear from the guidelines."
2020-03-16,53:27,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"If you are positive for the infection. If you have coronavirus, it is less how you feel than whether or not you’re still shedding virus. So the general issue about letting people out of a facility who, for example a hospital or whatever, who have been infected, you need two negative cultures the same way that was just described 24 hours apart."
2020-03-16,53:53,Donald Trump,"Yeah, no the marked will take care of itself. The market will be a very strong as soon as we get rid of the virus. Yes."
2020-03-16,54:06,Group,[crosstalk 00:00:54:06].
2020-03-16,54:09,Unnamed,Can you clarify about pregnant women? Is that an underlying? Because the UK said today that pregnancy was one of those underlying conditions. Do we say that too?
2020-03-16,54:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"There’s very little data on pregnant women. I think I, about a week ago, I said that reports that came in from China, from the Chinese CDC. Of the nine women who were documented to be pregnant and have coronavirus in their last tri-semester delivered healthy children and they themselves were healthy and recovered. That is our total sample size and we will be getting more data from countries. While countries are in the midst of this crisis like Italy, I try not to bother them frequently to get us their data. We try to get it just weekly from the countries that are in the midst of responding to the epidemic. So that their focus is on their individuals in their country."
2020-03-16,54:59,Unnamed,"Mr.President. Any comment on what people like Devin Nunez, the Governor of Oklahoma had been saying? Encouraging people to go out to restaurants, which goes directly against what this advice in your guidelines says."
2020-03-16,55:10,Donald Trump,I haven’t heard that. I haven’t heard that from Devin or anybody else.
2020-03-16,55:13,Unnamed,Should they stop saying that?
2020-03-16,55:16,Donald Trump,Well I have to see what they said. But-
2020-03-16,55:17,Unnamed,"They encouraged people to go to restaurants, if they felt okay with their families."
2020-03-16,55:20,Donald Trump,"Well, I would disagree with it. But right now we don’t have an order one way or the other. We don’t have an order, but I think it’s probably better that you don’t. Especially in certain areas, Oklahoma doesn’t have a tremendous problem. You said the Governor of Oklahoma?"
2020-03-16,55:34,Unnamed,"Governor of Oklahoma, Devin Nunez-"
2020-03-16,55:36,Donald Trump,And Devin.
2020-03-16,55:36,Unnamed,… was another.
2020-03-16,55:37,Donald Trump,"Yeah, well I had heard that."
2020-03-16,55:38,Unnamed,So should they be doing that or should they not be doing that in Oklahoma?
2020-03-16,55:41,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:55:41] I would said verse to what the professionals are saying.
2020-03-16,55:43,Unnamed,And what you’re saying in your guidelines.
2020-03-16,55:45,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-16,55:45,Unnamed,Is that people shouldn’t be going to restaurants.
2020-03-16,55:48,Donald Trump,I’ll take a look at it. Absolutely.
2020-03-16,55:51,John (Reporter),"I don’t know who would be best to answer this question. Maybe a Secretary Azar or Dr.Fauci. Schools districts across the country are closing down. Yet for the most part, daycare centers remain open. And considering the children can sometimes be asymptomatic carriers and go home to older individuals. Are there any recommendations about daycare centers?"
2020-03-16,56:13,Alex Azar,I prefer one of our medical professionals discuss that. That’s a clinical recommendation.
2020-03-16,56:19,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That’s a good question John. In the original guidelines as they were presented it was schools, not daycare. I think it’s very important we should probably, if we have not discussed that, go back and discuss that in some detail about whether or not that’s equivalent to school. It’s a good question."
2020-03-16,56:34,Unnamed,But the question about the sort of underlying public health strategy behind some of these guidelines. Telling people to avoid restaurants and bars is a different thing than saying that bars and restaurants should shut down over the next 15 days. So why was it seen as being imprudent or not necessarily to take that additional step offered at additional guidance?
2020-03-16,56:51,Donald Trump,Do you want to answer that?
2020-03-16,56:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, I think we have to say the data that has been coming out, and I’m sure you’re all up to date on how long the virus lives on hard surfaces. And that has been our concern over the last two weeks."
2020-03-16,57:07,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Don’t, I’m sorry go ahead. I just want, there’s an answer to this."
2020-03-16,57:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Oh, go ahead Tony. He was my mentor so I’m going to have to let him speak."
2020-03-16,57:19,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The small print here. It’s really small print. “In states with evidence of community transmission, bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other indoor and outdoor venues where groups of people congregate should be closed.”"
2020-03-16,57:35,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:57:35] So Mr. President are you telling governors in those states then to close all their restaurants and their bars?
2020-03-16,57:42,Donald Trump,Well we haven’t said that yet.
2020-03-16,57:43,Unnamed,Why not?
2020-03-16,57:43,Donald Trump,We’re recommending but-
2020-03-16,57:44,Unnamed,But if you think this would work.
2020-03-16,57:44,Donald Trump,"… we’re recommending things. No, we haven’t gone to that step yet. That could happen, but we haven’t gone there yet. Please."
2020-03-16,57:50,Unnamed,"So on the election, you’re saying it’s a bad thing to postpone it. But if you’ve got the 25 person maximum guideline in a practical sense, can you have rallies? Primaries, surely gather more than ten people."
2020-03-16,58:04,Donald Trump,"Well hopefully it will pas through and hopefully everybody will be going to restaurants and flying and being on cruise ships and all of these different things that we do. And it will very, very hopefully be at a fairly quick period of time. But we’re taking a tough stance. We may make certain other decisions, we may enhance those decisions. We’re going to find out as per the question that you were asking, some of those decisions may be hence. How about one more? Jennifer."
2020-03-16,58:33,Jennifer,On the cyber attack on HHS.
2020-03-16,58:35,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-16,58:35,Jennifer,Is there any reason to believe that they were trying to hack into the system and gather information from the system? And also is there any reason? So were they trying to hack to get information? And also do you have any reason to think that it could have been Iran? Russia? Do you have any reason to believe it was a foreign actor?
2020-03-16,58:51,Alex Azar,So in the previous 24 hours we saw a great deal of enhanced activity with relation to the HHS computer systems and website. Fortunately we have extremely strong barriers. We had no penetration into our networks. We had no degradation of the functioning of our networks. We had no limitation of our capacity for people to tele-work. We’ve taken very strong defensive actions. The source of this enhanced activity remains under investigation so I wouldn’t want to speculate on the source of it. But there was no data breach or no degradation in terms of our ability to function and serve our important mission here. Thank you.
2020-03-16,59:24,Unnamed,Mr. Vice President have you been tested yet? [crosstalk 00:59:26]
2020-03-16,59:26,Unnamed,What are you looking for in another stimulus package sir. Could you speak to that?
2020-03-16,59:30,Donald Trump,"One thing Mike just said, it’s very important to get out that this is for the next, much of what we’re talking about is for the next 15 days. Mike go ahead."
2020-03-16,59:39,Unnamed,Mr. Vice President have you been tested?
2020-03-16,59:41,Mike Pence,"I’ve not been tested yet. I’m in regular consultation with the White House Physician and he said, I’ve not been exposed to anyone for any period of time ahead of the coronavirus, and that my wife and I have no symptoms. But we’re checking our temperature regularly every day and we’ll continue to follow guidance."
2020-03-16,01:00:02,Mike Pence,"Which I think may be a good place to land at the end of the day. And that is as we expand testing rapidly around the country through the new public/private partnership that the president facilitated, we want the test to be available for people who have symptoms. People that who have symptoms and are in vulnerable populations and our healthcare workers to make sure that they can have the peace of mind that they’re doing their jobs and they’re properly protected."
2020-03-16,01:00:33,Mike Pence,"And so our best council, the council of the experts is if you have a question, call your doctor, call your healthcare provider, ask whether or not you should be tested. And that’s what my family is doing as well."
2020-03-16,01:00:44,Mike Pence,"Let me just emphasize one more point if I can. The president asked the task force to continuously review the data and the information that we have, not only in this country but from around the world. To give the best guidance to state leadership and local healthcare leadership and all of the American people about how to keep themselves, their family and their community safe. This guidance for the next 15 days is what our experts say is the best opportunity we have to lower the infection rate over the entire course of the coronavirus. Just as the president did by suspending travel from China, just as he did with travel advisories and screening from Italy and South Korea. Just as we’ve done with Europe and at midnight tonight with the UK and Ireland."
2020-03-16,01:01:35,Mike Pence,We will continue to take very decisive steps to lower the spread of the coronavirus. But we want every American to know and we would ask all of you in the media to spread the word of the American people. That this is advice on behalf of the President of the United States to every American what you can do over the next 15 days to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. And we’re calling on every American to do your part because together we’ll get through this and we’ll find our way forward.
2020-03-16,01:02:08,Donald Trump,Just one more. Steve go ahead please.
2020-03-16,01:02:08,Steve (Reporter),You had a G7-
2020-03-16,01:02:08,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-16,01:02:08,Steve (Reporter),… video conference today.
2020-03-16,01:02:08,Donald Trump,We had a G7.
2020-03-16,01:02:08,Steve (Reporter),What was the upshot of it?
2020-03-16,01:02:16,Donald Trump,It was-
2020-03-16,01:02:17,Steve (Reporter),Are you’re still going to be able to meet at Camp David.
2020-03-16,01:02:19,Donald Trump,It looks like it.
2020-03-16,01:02:20,Unnamed,And are you confident in their responses? As you are with Europe?
2020-03-16,01:02:22,Donald Trump,"I am very confident. They’re in a position that some of them are in a rough position. If you look at a couple of them. And some are heading toward pretty rough territory. We had a very good a conference. It was a teleconference. Everybody was on the phone, every leader. And almost a hundred percent was devoted to the subject that we’re talking about today. And they are working very hard and they’re very concerned obviously, but they’re working very hard. But I would say just about all of it was Steve, all of it was devoted to what we’re talking about."
2020-03-16,01:02:57,Steve (Reporter),Hold that summit at Camp David?
2020-03-16,01:02:59,Donald Trump,"I think so. I mean so far it seems, we didn’t even discuss that. It’s still a ways off. But it was a very good discussion and there’s a great comradery. There’s a great togetherness. I think I can say that very, very strongly. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
2020-03-17,18:28,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much everyone. Thank you. Progress being made and I appreciate you’re all joining us. Last night the FDA announced groundbreaking new policies to further increase testing, very substantially so. All states can now authorize tests developed and used within their borders in addition to the FDA. So the states are very much involved. They have been involved from the beginning, but we’re stepping it up as much as we can and the testing procedures are going well and within a short period of time, all of the private labs will kick in. This never been done before and it’s going to be something very … I think it’s going to be incredible if it’s done properly and these great companies. These are among the greatest companies in the world actually. So the state is going to be dealing through themselves and with local government, local physicians, local everybody. They’re also dealing with us, but we have a tremendous testing capacity."
2020-03-17,19:33,Donald Trump,"Today we’re also announcing a dramatic expansion of our Medicare Telehealth services. Medicare patients can now visit any doctor by phone or video conference at no additional costs, including with commonly used services like FaceTime and Skype, a historic breakthrough. This has not been done before either. In addition, states have the authority to recover Telehealth services for their medical patients and by doing this, the patient is not seeing the doctor per se, but they’re seeing the doctor so there’s no getting close. During this time, we will not enforce applicable HIPAA penalties so that doctors can greatly expand care for their patients using Telehealth. So the penalties won’t be enforced. We encourage everyone to maximize use of Telehealth to limit exposure to the virus. It’s been a very successful method of communication but never used on a scale like we’re going to use the Telehealth. And you’ll be able to also better maintain hospital capacity by doing this."
2020-03-17,20:41,Donald Trump,"Earlier this morning, I spoke with executives from America’s fast food industry, Wendy’s, McDonald’s, all of the big ones, Burger King, and they were great. We were talking about the pickups in light of yesterday’s guidance. You heard to avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, or public food courts. We discussed the important role that the drive-through pickup and delivery service can play in the weeks ahead. So that’s happening and they have been fantastic. They have been absolutely fantastic and they’ve been doing it already, but they’re keeping it open and smaller staffs of very capable people and very capable companies and they’re doing it, pickups."
2020-03-17,21:28,Donald Trump,"Our guidance yesterday urges Americans to take action for 15 days to help stem the outbreak, so it’s a 15 day period. I guess now we’d say it’s a 14 day period. It’s 15 days from yesterday and we’re asking everyone to work at home if possible, postpone unnecessary travel and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people. By making shared sacrifices and temporary changes, we can protect the health of our people and we can protect our economy because I think our economy will come back very rapidly. So it’s 15 days from yesterday. We’ll see what happens after that. If we do this right, our country and the world frankly, but our country can be rolling again pretty quickly, pretty quickly. We have to fight that invisible enemy that I guess unknown, but we’re getting to know it a lot better."
2020-03-17,22:21,Donald Trump,"Today, the Senate has taken up coronavirus legislation that includes free testing for those who need it, as well as paid sick leave and family medical leave for workers affected by the virus. We’re also committed to getting small businesses the support that they need. In fact, one of the things we talked about with the fast food operations, we spoke to the chairman and CEOs of all of the companies, but one of the things we discussed is exactly that, getting small businesses’ support and flexibility that they need for themselves and for their workers and that’s being worked on right now."
2020-03-17,22:56,Donald Trump,"At my direction, Secretary Mnuchin is meeting today with senators on additional stimulus packages. I can tell you he’s meeting with them late until the night last night and for a big part of the day yesterday and tremendous things are happening. There’s great spirit, tremendous spirit, and I can say that for Republicans and Democrats. I can say that with respect to Governor Cuomo. We had a great talk this morning. We’re both doing a really good job and we’re coordinating it and we agree. Different states need different things and we agree on that 100%, but we had a very good talk and I think we’re right down the same track and it’s going to be very successful."
2020-03-17,23:39,Donald Trump,"New York has a pretty big problem I guess would be the number one hot spot. That’s no fault of anybody’s. It’s just the way it is. But we’re working very closely together. We’re also getting FEMA very much involved. They’ve been involved but now we’re getting them to a different level and we’ll have everything ready. We’re dealing with the Army Corps of engineers should that be necessary. We have them working in some cases, on standby in other cases, but my conversation with Andrew Cuomo was a very, very productive one and a very good one and I appreciate that."
2020-03-17,24:13,Donald Trump,"We’re giving relief to affected industries and small businesses and we’re ensuring that we emerge from this challenge with a prosperous and growing economy because that’s what’s going to happen. It’s going to pop. One day we’ll be standing possibly up here. We’ll say, “Well, we won,” and we’re going to say that. Sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that, and we’re going to win. I think we’re going to win faster than people think, I hope."
2020-03-17,24:38,Donald Trump,"Later today, I’ll meet with the leaders from the tourism industry as well as industrial supply retailers and wholesalers to discuss their critical roles. As you know, I met with the department store people, all of the retailers, the big ones including Walmart and others, and it was great meeting. They’re stocking up their stores like they’ve never stocked them before. We’re trying to get people to actually buy less, if that’s possible. Buy less. Don’t take everything, just buy what you need for a while. They’re going to stay open all hours of the day and they’ve really been, they’ve been fantastic."
2020-03-17,25:14,Donald Trump,"We’re taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger, frankly stronger than ever before. And we recognize that while many American workers can work from home, many others cannot. Many of our healthcare providers, first responders and men and women in the food service and manufacturing are showing that … They’re showing up and standing up to provide us with the goods and services we need. So we want people to stay home where they can, but many cases when you talk about food service and manufacturing certain items in particular, they’re going in and they’re practicing all of the safety rules and regulations that we talk about. So with that, I’d like to just introduce our great vice president, Mike Pence. He’ll say a few words and then I’ll make some other introductions. Thank you very much."
2020-03-17,26:08,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President and good morning. It should be very clear to the American people that President Trump has initiated not only a whole of government approach, but a whole of America approach. And the president’s interaction even today and through the course of this day with leaders in industry around the country reflects that we’re not only bringing the full weight of the federal government to bear, but the full weight of the American economy. And I know I speak on behalf of the president when I say how inspired we are at the way the American people have stepped up and the way that American businesses, large and small, have stepped up. It’s truly been inspiring."
2020-03-17,26:44,Mike Pence,"Our task force met this morning. We continue to focus on President Trump’s priorities of testing, prevention and supplies. And in that category, I’m pleased to report that while testing is available in all 50 states as the president just indicated, through the swift action of the FDA at the encouragement of-"
2020-03-17,27:03,Mike Pence,"Syndicated through the swift action of the FDA at the encouragement of governors around the country. Now a state health authorities can authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities. But also in connection with the FDA’s action which we’ll hear more about in a moment, we now have continued to expand the public and private partnership that the president forged with vast commercial laboratories around the country, increasing access to the high volume, high throughput Coronavirus testing that is greatly expanding access even as we speak."
2020-03-17,27:39,Mike Pence,"Also our task force received a report this morning on the progress that the US Public Health Service and FEMA are making, working closely with state governments and also partners in the private sector like CVS, Target, Walgreen and Walmart to expand remote testing sites around the country and we’ll have a full report later this week as those come online."
2020-03-17,28:02,Mike Pence,"It’s important the American people understand the testing is happening all over the country but all of our health experts wanted me to tell the American people, you don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do and President Trump’s 15 day coronavirus guidelines, our advice for every American, in every community. They’re the result of the best guidance of CDC and our health experts and as the president said, we continue to urge every American over the next 15 days, to put into practice the principles in the president’s Coronavirus Guidelines."
2020-03-17,28:40,Mike Pence,"By every American practicing these principles, we believe that we can slow the spread of the Coronavirus. In fact, our experts have told our task force that if every American acts on the president’s Coronavirus guidelines, we could see a substantial reduction in the spread of the Coronavirus. But as the president said, it will take all of us to do it."
2020-03-17,29:04,Mike Pence,"So if you feel sick, stay home. If someone in your house tests positive, keep the entire household home, especially if you’re a person with an underlying health condition, we urge you to stay home and practice social distancing from people; no social gatherings of more than 10 people, use drive through as the president discussed with leaders in the industry today and every American, especially practicing common sense and good hygiene."
2020-03-17,29:29,Mike Pence,"For the American people as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low but we’re asking every American to partner with us in this effort to slow the spread of the virus and especially to be mindful of seniors or others with serious underlying health conditions for whom the threat of the Coronavirus can be very significant and very real."
2020-03-17,29:53,Mike Pence,"As I said, the president has continued to push our task force to bring a whole of government, a whole America approach and we continue to be inspired the way our nation’s governors, nation’s businesses are responding. We spoke just yesterday with the leaders of every broadcast network in America that will soon be unveiling a public service campaign using CDC guidelines and specifically, as we work on the issue of supplies, meetings yesterday with Department of Defense officials about excess supplies."
2020-03-17,30:23,Mike Pence,"The president and I will be meeting today to speak about the supply chain for hospitals. We would make one specific request and that is we would urge construction companies to donate their inventory of N95 masks to your local hospital and forgo additional orders of those industrial masks because of what the president asked to be included in legislation moving through the Congress today, those industrial masks that they use on construction sites, are perfectly acceptable for healthcare workers to be protected from a respiratory disease. But we’re asking construction companies that our president knows very well from his background, we’re asking them to donate their N95 masks to their local hospitals and also forego making additional orders."
2020-03-17,31:10,Mike Pence,"At the president’s direction we will continue to do whatever it takes. We’ll continue to marshal the best of the American people, the best of all the people behind me, the people behind them, our state and local officials and we will get through this and we will get through this together. Thank you. Mr. President."
2020-03-17,31:31,Donald Trump,"I want to thank Chad Wolf and Homeland Security and the job they did at the airports was really incredible. They screened thousands and thousands of people. O’Hara got backed up a little bit, but they got them out but everybody was screened and screened very carefully. They didn’t want to rush it. I think it was 13 airports and it was an incredible thing. Then they had a big surge also from the UK and Ireland and that went very smoothly, but they did a fantastic job. They work long hours and they did a fantastic job."
2020-03-17,32:06,Donald Trump,"I’d like to introduce Steven Mnuchin and then I’m going to ask Steve to leave because he’s going to the Hill. He’s been working very hard with the Senate and with actually with the House on a very, very big bold package. It’s going to be big and it’s going to be bold and the level again of enthusiasm to get something done, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like it. So, Steve Mnuchin, please."
2020-03-17,32:31,Steve Mnuchin,Thank you Mr. President. I’d like to announce some very significant actions that the president has approved today.
2020-03-17,32:37,Steve Mnuchin,"The first, I would say is earlier today I sent a letter to Fed Chairman Powell approving his request to use 13(3) and what that will do is the Fed will be setting up a special purpose vehicle, which the treasury will invest $10 billion in from one of our funds. That will the Fed to guarantee the purchase of A1P1 commercial paper growing forward. That is a $1 trillion market and is critical to American workers, it’s critical to American business and it’s critical to American savers who have a lot of that money in money market funds."
2020-03-17,33:18,Steve Mnuchin,"So we heard loud and clear there were liquidity issues. This is very significant and we’ll create, I don’t think we’ll need to use it all, but we have the ability to have the Fed purchase up to $1 trillion of commercial paper is needed."
2020-03-17,33:34,Steve Mnuchin,"That has already created significant stability in the market today. The second thing I would say is we’ve previously talked about differing IRS payments. The president earlier this morning authorized me to announce this program. I have previously announced we would defer 200 billion. The president suggested we increased that to 300 billion, which will we will be doing."
2020-03-17,33:58,Steve Mnuchin,"Now let me just be clear on the specifics. We encourage those Americans who can file their taxes to continue to file their taxes on April 15th because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds. We want you to make sure you get them. Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS. If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and the reason why we’re doing $1 million is that covers lots of pass throughs and small businesses and $10 million to corporations, interest free and penalty free for 90 days."
2020-03-17,34:40,Steve Mnuchin,"All you have to do is file your taxes; you’ll automatically not get charged interest in penalties. Now of course, any American has the right to extend their taxes. We’re not taking that a right, but the president has asked us to go up to $300 billion. That’s also an enormous amount of liquidity in the system. The third thing is the president and I worked on a very significant economic stimulus plan. Thank you for being available last night and throughout this morning and I will be presenting that to the Republicans in the Senate this morning and also discussing that with the House. We look forward to having bipartisan support. We’re now working with the Senate to pass this legislation very quickly and these will be payments to small businesses. We’ve talked about loan guarantees, so to critical industries such as airlines and hotels and we’ve also talked about a stimulus package to the American worker. You can think of this as something like business interruption payments for the American workers. Thank you."
2020-03-17,35:47,Donald Trump,Do you have any questions or the Secretary of the Treasury?
2020-03-17,35:50,Unnamed,"When you say a stimulus package for American workers, do you mean direct payments to Americans or are talking about a payroll tax holiday?"
2020-03-17,35:57,Steve Mnuchin,"Although the president likes the idea that the payroll tax holiday, I will tell you what we’ve heard from many people and the president to said, we can consider this. The payroll tax holiday would get people money over the next six to eight months. We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately and what we’ve heard from hardworking Americans, many companies have now shut down, whether it’s bars or restaurants, Americans need cash now and the president wants to get cash now and I mean now in the next two weeks."
2020-03-17,36:24,Unnamed,How much?
2020-03-17,36:25,Steve Mnuchin,I will be previewing that with the Republicans. There’s some numbers out there. They may be a little bit bigger than what’s in the process.
2020-03-17,36:33,Donald Trump,"Please, please wait please."
2020-03-17,36:35,Unnamed,What help are you going to give to airlines specifically?
2020-03-17,36:38,Steve Mnuchin,"I’ve had discussions with all the airline CEOs this week. The airline CEOs have had conversations with the Senate and the House, as the president said, I was up with a subset of the Republican senators last night. I’ve discussed that with them. I think as you know, this is worse than 9/11. For the airline industry, they are almost ground to a halt."
2020-03-17,37:01,Steve Mnuchin,"The president wants to make sure that although we don’t want people to travel and let’s, it’s critical, we want to maintain for critical travel, the right to have domestic travel."
2020-03-17,37:12,Steve Mnuchin,I’m not going to comment on the specifics. I will tell you we’re very focused. There’s a lot of workers. This is strategically important to us and we’ll be working with Congress.
2020-03-17,37:21,Donald Trump,"The airline industry will be in good shape. Yeah, go ahead please."
2020-03-17,37:24,Unnamed,There’s been talk about a thousand dollar checks to every American increasing support among Republicans and some Democrats for that. Would you support that going to everyone or would you support some sort of income restriction on who gets a check?
2020-03-17,37:40,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, I think it’s clear. We don’t need to send people who make $1 million a year checks. Okay. But we like, that’s one of the ideas we like. We’re going to preview that today and then we’ll be talking about details after."
2020-03-17,37:52,Donald Trump,"I think I think we’re going to do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible. That may not be an accurate way of doing it because obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks for $1,000 and we’ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day what we’re going to be doing."
2020-03-17,38:08,Unnamed,"How would the mechanics of this work? I mean, we’ve been talking about a payroll tax holiday. Some $500 billion worth was floated today. So how would this idea of sending people a check work? Would that be sort of an advance on what they would pay in payroll checks?"
2020-03-17,38:23,Steve Mnuchin,"Again, we want to make sure Americans get money in their pockets quickly. We want to make sure small business owners have access to funds. We want to make sure that hotels, airlines, we have an entire package. We’ll be laying out those details later."
2020-03-17,38:39,Donald Trump,"I have to say this, there are four different ways you can do it. You can hear me well enough, I imagine. People at home; those are very important people, especially your people."
2020-03-17,38:55,Donald Trump,"Look, we have four or five ways we can do it, four ways in particular. I think there’s a fifth possibility but there are some very good ways of getting the money out and getting it out quickly. Payroll tax is one way, but it does come over a period of months, many months and we want to do something much faster than that. So I think we have ways of getting money out pretty quickly and very accurately."
2020-03-17,39:15,Unnamed,Can you talk about the timeline please? How quickly do you think you can get this done?
2020-03-17,39:22,Steve Mnuchin,"The president has instructed me, we have to do this now. So this is now."
2020-03-17,39:27,Unnamed,By the end of the week?
2020-03-17,39:28,Steve Mnuchin,"We are going to work with the Senate, who’s in session right now, actively. We will continue to have conversations with the House. I’ve already spoken to Speaker Pelosi once today. This is stuff that needs to be done now."
2020-03-17,39:39,Steve Mnuchin,"The president has instructed me that this is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of this economy and we’re going to use all the tools we have, as I’ve said, and what tools we don’t have, we’re going back to Congress. I’ve got to go back."
2020-03-17,39:54,Unnamed,Can we assume the price tag is $850 billion to those who might be concerned that’s too expensive.
2020-03-17,39:57,Donald Trump,"We don’t want to talk about it but it’s a substantial number. We’re going big. The expression, we could do it two ways. We could keep going back every day or every week. We’re going big and that’s where Mitch McConnell, that’s the way he wants to go. That’s the way I want to go. I think we want to get it done and have a big infusion as opposed to going through a little meetings every couple of days. We don’t want to do it that way. We want to go big, go solid."
2020-03-17,40:22,Donald Trump,"The country is very strong. We’ve never been so strong and that’s what we’re going to be doing. We don’t want with this invisible enemy, we don’t want airlines going out of business. We don’t want people losing their jobs or not having money to live when they were doing very well just four weeks ago. So we’re going big and that’s the way it’ll be and that’s the way everybody seems to like it on the Hill."
2020-03-17,40:42,Donald Trump,Any other questions for Steve?
2020-03-17,40:43,Unnamed,"In addition to airlines and hotels, you had a call with restaurants today. Was any type of emergency assistance discussed on that call? A lot of restaurants have to close. Even if they are doing delivery, they’re not making as much money as they would with a full house."
2020-03-17,40:57,Steve Mnuchin,"Let me make two comments on the restaurants and the president understands this, that this was emphasized this morning."
2020-03-17,41:03,Steve Mnuchin,"First of all, we want to make sure that the states allow the drive through portion of these fast foods to stay open. Particularly in a time period where we’re telling people don’t go to restaurants, these companies feed a big part of America and I expect they’re going to feed a bigger part of America."
2020-03-17,41:23,Steve Mnuchin,"The second thing they asked me to emphasize, I wasn’t going to do it now, but as long as you asked, many of these companies have apps. You can order ahead of time, that way when you get there, it’s as simple as they’ll have it packed, they can give it to you with social distancing and it’ll be very fast."
2020-03-17,41:40,Steve Mnuchin,"So we expect that they will be able to feed a large part of the population and in regards to support, I will say a lot of these businesses are small businesses or companies, franchisees, 500 or less, and we have a specific program we’ll be unveiling that helps all businesses, small and medium sized businesses of 500."
2020-03-17,42:03,Unnamed,Question regarding Marriott corporation. It announced that it is furloughing thousands of individuals because of the impacts of the Coronavirus. Will your legislation help those individuals?
2020-03-17,42:16,Steve Mnuchin,"I hope so. That’s one of the reasons why we got to act very quickly because we understand whether it’s the airlines, hotels, for good reasons to protect the United States on medical issues, these businesses are shut down and the president wants to make sure, as I’ve said, we will use all the powers we have. You saw this today, trillion dollars of potential liquidity into the market and the powers we don’t have, we’re going to Congress and I will say there’s a lot of bipartisan support for these issues."
2020-03-17,42:47,Steve Mnuchin,So I’m going to apologize because I have to go deal with some other [inaudible 00:00:42:53].
2020-03-17,42:52,Donald Trump,"Thanks, Steve."
2020-03-17,42:57,Steve Mnuchin,"I do want to comment on this. Okay. We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open. Okay. Americans need to know they have access to their money. After September 11th, the only reason why the markets were closed was because the technology was disrupted. I’ve been on the phone with the major banks, with the New York Stock Exchange; everybody wants to keep it open. We may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that’s something they need to do, but American’s should know that we’re going to do everything to make sure that they have access to their money at their banks, to the money in their 401ks and to the money in stocks. So I want to just be very clear, we intend to keep the markets open."
2020-03-17,43:39,Donald Trump,"And the banks are record setting strong, so we have that, which is a much different event than what we had not so long ago. John, go ahead."
2020-03-17,43:51,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, you mentioned the Army Corps of Engineers, that you’ve had a conversation with Governor Cuomo. People [inaudible 00:43:57] the New York is going to run out of hospital beds. Are you prepared to mobilize the army corp and as to when we reach capacity?"
2020-03-17,44:02,Donald Trump,"Yes, we’re starting to. We’re starting the process and it’s a process. We hope it’s not going to be necessary, but it could be necessary."
2020-03-17,44:09,Donald Trump,"The state is working on it very hard themselves, but we’ll probably supplement what they’re doing."
2020-03-17,44:14,Unnamed,"Given that many of the precursors for our pharmaceuticals come from China and there’ve been supply disruption, that supply chain has been broken to some degree. Do you expect that we could run into a shortage of prescription drugs?"
2020-03-17,44:28,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t see that at all and I think China has every incentive to make sure that things work well. China wants to make sure that things work very well. They have every incentive to do so. Jeff."
2020-03-17,44:41,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, the Governor of Ohio has called off the election that was supposed to happen today, the primary election. Do you agree with that decision and what steps are you taking to ensure that elections going forward, if this pandemic continues, that elections will be able to happen including the course, the big one in the fall?"
2020-03-17,45:00,Donald Trump,"Well, the Governor of Ohio is doing a great job. He called that off and we’ll see what happens, is a court case and it hasn’t been fully determined yet, but if he called it off I could understand that because you know he’s definitely somebody that knows what he’s doing. We’ll be seeing very soon, they’re going by the rule of 10 as opposed to 50 and it’s pretty tough. I would say probably you could violate that if you wanted to for an election."
2020-03-17,45:25,Donald Trump,"I just think an election is a very special thing he’s going to chose. He chose a different date, I think a date sometime in June but that would be a decision that would be made by him. He felt it was necessary. The courts are, somebody challenging it, so the courts will ultimately decide."
2020-03-17,45:41,John (Reporter),"Well what are you doing to ensure that further elections, if we’re still in this situation a month from now, two months from now?"
2020-03-17,45:50,Donald Trump,"What I’m doing? Yeah. What I’m doing John’s, very simple. We’re getting rid of this virus. That’s what we’re doing. That’s the best thing we can do."
2020-03-17,45:55,Donald Trump,"By the way, for the markets, for everything. It’s very simple, very simple solution. We want to get rid of it. We want to have very, as few deaths as possible. This is a horrible thing. You look at what’s going on with Italy. We don’t want to be in a position like that but a much larger because we’re a much larger country. We don’t want to be there and I think we’ve done really well. I think we’ve done well. I think the states have done well. We’re all working together."
2020-03-17,46:18,Donald Trump,"The best thing we can do is get rid of the virus. Once that’s gone, it’s going to pop back like nobody’s ever seen before. That’s my opinion but I think it will pop back like nobody’s ever seen before. Please."
2020-03-17,46:28,Unnamed,"Just to follow up on John’s question, specifically how many new hospital facilities could the Army Corps of Engineers build and also what specific measures are you taking to try to increase the number of ventilators in the stockpile?"
2020-03-17,46:40,Donald Trump,"I ordered a massive numbers of ventilators. We have by any normal standards, we have a lot of respirators, ventilators. We have tremendous amounts of equipment but compared to what we’re talking about here, this has never been done before. Yesterday I gave the governors the right to go order directly if they want, if they feel they can do it faster than going through the federal government."
2020-03-17,47:01,Donald Trump,"Now we’ve knocked out all of the bureaucracy. It’s very direct, but it’s still always faster to order directly and I gave them, that was totally misinterpreted by the New York Times on purpose unfortunately. But it’s very important. Yes, Mike."
2020-03-17,47:14,Mike Pence,If I could amplify.
2020-03-17,47:15,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-17,47:17,Mike Pence,"The president directed us to work with the Department of Defense. There’s two ways that DOD can be helpful in terms of expanding medical capacity. I know the Governor of New York has asked us to look at the Army Corps of Engineer, which could perhaps renovate existing buildings, but the president also has us inventorying what you all would understand is field hospitals or MASH hospitals that can be deployed very quickly."
2020-03-17,47:42,Mike Pence,"We spoke with a governor Inslee yesterday in Washington state. We have resources in that part of the country that we could move and as governors make these requests, we will process them, bring them to the president."
2020-03-17,47:54,Mike Pence,"But there are two different lanes that VOD can provide, in addition to many medical supplies to augment our national reserves and the president has tasked us to evaluate and make available and to consider every request from governors for either field hospitals, expanding facilities or the Army Corps of Engineer that could retrofit existing buildings."
2020-03-17,48:16,Donald Trump,"The Army Corps is very prepared to do, as we say, and we’re looking at where it’s going, and they do call them MASH hospitals, but the field hospitals go up very quickly there. We have them, we have all of this equipment in stock and we’re looking at different sites in a few different locations and we’re not going to need in West Virginia where so far I guess they have none. Still none. Still none. Right. West Virginia. Big Jim, the governors, he must be doing a good job. That’s what’s reported."
2020-03-17,48:49,Unnamed,Is that a reporting issue or is that they have no cases?
2020-03-17,48:52,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s all.I just see. West Virginia is the only one that has no cases. So obviously that’s being treated differently than a New Yorker or a California; different parts of California. I do say this though. The the Army Corps of Engineers is ready, willing and able."
2020-03-17,49:09,Donald Trump,"We have to give them the go ahead, if we find that it’s going to be necessary. We think we can have quite a few units up very rapidly. I’m going to work with Governor Cuomo. I’m going to work with a number of the governors. Governor Newsome has been very generous in his words and I’m being generous to him too because we’re all working together very well and I think a lot of very positive things have taken place."
2020-03-17,49:34,Donald Trump,"We’re talking to California about different sites but we can, we can have a lot of units up fairly quickly if we think we need them."
2020-03-17,49:42,Donald Trump,"I think what I’ll do is I might ask Sema to say a few words on the telehealth and then we can get back to this, please. Sema."
2020-03-17,49:50,Seema Verma,"Thank you, Mr. President. As the president announced earlier, we are doing a dramatic expansion of what’s known as telehealth for our 62 million Medicare beneficiaries who are amongst the most vulnerable to the Coronavirus. We’re acting in accord with the appropriations bill that was signed on March 6th, as well as the president’s emergency declaration last week. This action is a part of our broader effort to ensure that government requirements, rules and regulations, don’t get in the way of patient care during an emergency."
2020-03-17,50:22,Seema Verma,"Today’s announcement, builds on the significant progress of the president has already made over the past three years around telehealth services and while we have allowed for virtual check-ins, full telehealth benefits have been restricted to those living in rural areas, established patients and just for those brief visits. But no longer; Medicare beneficiaries across the nation, no matter where they live, will now be able to receive a wide range of services via telehealth without ever having to leave home."
2020-03-17,50:52,Seema Verma,"These services can also be provided in a variety of settings including nursing homes, hospital outpatient departments and more. Thanks to the leadership of HHS, will also be temporarily relaxing certain HIPAA requirements so that doctors can provide telehealth with their own phones and we’ll be using enforcement discretion when it comes to collecting copays so that cost won’t be a barrier."
2020-03-17,51:15,Seema Verma,"This is a part of our larger efforts around mitigation and as we are encouraging Americans to stay home whenever possible, we don’t want our Medicare policies getting in the way. So consider the implications of this."
2020-03-17,51:27,Seema Verma,"Perhaps an elderly patient with diabetes needs routine checkup and this has nothing to do with the Coronavirus. So with our new telehealth benefits, this person who’s not really, who’s at risk for the Coronavirus doesn’t have to venture outside their home. They can talk to their doctor via Skype and they don’t have to risk exposure to the virus and they can receive that care from the safety of their own home."
2020-03-17,51:52,Seema Verma,"It could be another Medicare recipient who’s experiencing mild flu-like symptoms and instead of leaving the house and sitting in a waiting room full of other vulnerable people, they can also receive advice from their doctor from their home. This shift is very important for clinicians and providers who over the coming weeks, will face considerable strain on their time and resources."
2020-03-17,52:15,Seema Verma,Now Medicare patients who don’t absolutely need to come in to an office won’t have to and this allows the healthcare system to prioritize for care for those that have more needs are in dire need and preserves protective equipment as well.
2020-03-17,52:32,Seema Verma,State Medicaid agencies can also provide telehealth services without federal approval and so we’re asking all states to make this available as well. We’ve also asked private insurance companies to expand their telehealth benefits and make it clear to their providers and their members what they cover.
2020-03-17,52:49,Seema Verma,"As our nation seeks to balance the twin imperatives of getting Americans the care that they need during this outbreak and limiting the spread of the virus, the impact of this historic action simply cannot be overstated. In an emergency, those on the frontline shouldn’t have to worry about federal rules and red tape hamstringing them when they need flexibility above all else and we’re doing everything in our power to make sure that that doesn’t happen."
2020-03-17,53:15,Seema Verma,"Also, just want to briefly mention that because of the president’s emergency declaration, we do have the ability to provide a lot of Medicaid waivers and Florida was the first state to be approved. We were able to do that in a matter of days. Thank you."
2020-03-17,53:28,Donald Trump,Any questions?
2020-03-17,53:30,Unnamed,Where do senior citizens go for instructions on how to do the telehealth?
2020-03-17,53:34,Seema Verma,"They should call their doctor’s office and their doctor’s office can tell them how to do that. Also, there may be some of our Medicare members that may not have access to equipment so we’re asking family members to help with this, but also respecting the requirements around social distancing and if any of those family members or neighbors have symptoms, they should obviously stay away."
2020-03-17,53:53,Donald Trump,Will you be posting numbers also?
2020-03-17,53:55,Seema Verma,That’s correct.
2020-03-17,53:55,Donald Trump,That might be the easiest way to do it.
2020-03-17,53:57,Seema Verma,Yes.
2020-03-17,53:57,Donald Trump,"If you post in ads, if you post some numbers."
2020-03-17,54:00,Seema Verma,They can also call our 1-800-MEDICARE number and they can also get…
2020-03-17,54:03,Unnamed,They can also call our 1-800-MEDICARE number. They can also get information. Those phone lines are open.
2020-03-17,54:07,Donald Trump,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Admiral, if you’d say a few words about where we’re going. Then I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to say a couple of words, but how the system’s working?"
2020-03-17,54:17,Brett Giroir,"Well, thank you very much. As we talked about earlier this week, the commercial system is rapidly advancing in the testing capabilities. As of today, our public health laboratories, meaning the CDC and the public health labs, have reported out 31,878 tests, so almost 32,000 tests. The clinical laboratories, the Association of Clinical Laboratories, have reported out about 27,000 tests. Most importantly of those 27,000 during the cumulative period of time, 8,200 of them were yesterday. This is showing the dramatic ramp as the high throughput comes in. We don’t have the numbers this morning from the American Hospital Association, which means all the individual hospital laboratories we will have that upcoming in the next day or so. Then Ambassador Birx will have this whole process fixed under with the legislation that everything will roll up into a common reporting probably by the end of next week."
2020-03-17,55:18,Brett Giroir,"In terms of our drive-thru laboratories, again, these are blossoming all over the country by individual states. The ones that we are heavily involved in and really pushing equipment to, we expect over the next few days to begin setting up 47 of these in approximately 12 states. The material is already palletized and being shipped to the locations. Most cities have the specific locations. Some do not, but it’s still gone to a central receiving. We know that we’ll be deploying at least 140 commissioned corps officers. About half of the sites have reported their requirements. About 140 officers will be going. We expect that to go up. This is going on the way we expected."
2020-03-17,56:03,Brett Giroir,"We did a trial site yesterday with a full mobile unit for drive-thru with full PPE. We had a lot of kinks in the system as you can expect. That’s why we do a test before we go out into the field. Don’t expect these to be 100% perfect the moment they come. They’re going to be adapted to the state and the local situation. But we’re very confident that these will add testing to the already very robust healthcare system and commercial system. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-17,56:30,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you, Admiral. This has never been done before. It sets a great roadmap for our future should we have something like this in the future. I hope we don’t, but it’s never been done before. They’ve done an incredible job. But again, we’re working with the states and relying on the states. We have to because it’s point of sale, its point of sight. We’re in I think just about every instance getting along really well with the states. If I could, Dr. Birx, if you could say a couple of words, please?"
2020-03-17,57:00,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I think what you’ve been hearing from us is to find solutions that are high quality and sustainable based on the front line workers and governor’s request. Those come in on the governor’s call. We’ve been immediately responsive to those. That’s the level of red tape and bureaucracy that we have removed."
2020-03-17,57:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think that point about sustainability and quality is very important because as the President says, we’re creating a roadmap for a different level of functionality for future pandemics. Our flu pandemic preparedness plan was a plan. Now we are seeing where we have to revise, where we have to create new avenues of research and new avenues of work to really ensure that the need of the American people can be reached. We were adamant about having a high-quality test based on our commercial vendors. Over the next few months, you will begin to see that other tests that were utilized around the world were not of the same quality resulting in false positives and potentially false negatives. These tests were studied and studied by the FDA to really ensure that they are that level of quality. We’ve given the states the permission to ensure that same level of quality."
2020-03-17,58:19,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Now, I wanted to say one minute on the testing. Testing should not be used as an assessment of your risk. We are asking every single American, no matter what your generation, from Z and up to X and millennials in between, to really ensure that you’re following these guidelines. We hear every night of people who are not in work moving that time into bars and other areas of large gatherings. If we continue with that process, we will fail in containing this virus. Every single generation has a role to play. We’re asking our older generation to stay in their homes. We’re asking the younger generations to support them in social contacting through videos and other Skype-type functions or just the simple telephone. We’re asking the younger generations to stop going out in public places to bars and restaurants and spreading asymptomatic virus onto countertops and knobs and grocery stores and grocery carts."
2020-03-17,59:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I heard an innovation last night and this morning again on the news. I really want to apply the private sector who are now creating senior-only shopping times. I think that’s extraordinary. I think that shows what America brings. I think other countries will learn from us about how to really protect seniors in this type of way. I’m hoping that carries through to next year when we have our flu epidemic where we can really have a very different profile of the amount of mortality that we have during flu that we never talk about. Anywhere from 15,000 to 45,000 individuals are lost every year. If we learn how to do this well and sustain some of those core changes, we can change the way respiratory viruses, not only for this, but the future affect Americans."
2020-03-17,01:00:12,Donald Trump,"It’s a big thing. Doctor, maybe a couple of questions?"
2020-03-17,01:00:16,Unnamed,"A question on the clinical data. We’ve had now roughly 5,000 people test positive. We’ve had 90 deaths or so. When are we going to know the data of who those people are? Who has been infected? What the ages are? What the preexisting conditions are? How serious it was both for those who have been tested positive but also those who have died?"
2020-03-17,01:00:40,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You are singing my sheet of music. I’m very data-oriented. Thank you for bringing up this issue of data. I really want to applaud HHS. We had a discussion about this several days ago. They’ve made calls into Seattle and California to really understand that and also importantly to understand how many of their patients needed ventilators, how many of them needed oxygen support, how many of them needed and what they needed. Could we predict early someone who was going to have a more difficult course? These are all the questions we’re asking right and answering right now."
2020-03-17,01:01:16,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We did get an early report back from Santa Clara and Seattle. We’re digesting it. We just got it this morning. We’re looking at that carefully because we think that roadmap is very important to other communities. We have not discussed this with New York yet. We do know from other countries and that all is available online, that profile. You can see that mortality under 30 is extraordinarily low. The mortality across the board outside of Wuhan is now settling somewhere around 0.7, but that should not be reassuring because it’s much higher in people with preexisting medical conditions, even if young, and people that are older with preexisting medical conditions. We still want every American focused on doing what they can do today to change the course of this pandemic."
2020-03-17,01:02:04,Unnamed,Will you commit to making that data public so we will all know?
2020-03-17,01:02:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’re committed not only to making it public, but to have a website that everyone can see in realtime."
2020-03-17,01:02:13,Unnamed,"Dr. Birx, if I could just follow up. You all are signaling a much more aggressive posture toward containment mitigation now. Many states have been very aggressive, but there is a small number of states that have not issued public guidance to their residents. Is it important for the success of the effort that 100% of the states be forward-leaning on this? If so, Mr. President, what would be your message to those states that have not?"
2020-03-17,01:02:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That’s why the Vice President and the President yesterday issued those critical guidelines. As I said this morning on Fox & Friends, you can look at them as guidelines. You can look at them as requirements and you can look at him as the President asking every American in every state to follow those. That’s why we put them out at the federal level. We wanted to make sure every American knew what they could do today to change the course of this epidemic."
2020-03-17,01:03:11,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think it’s empowering. I think it says all of us have a social responsibility to each other. That’s why we believe that every mayor and every governor should be instituting these guidelines that came from the White House and the President of the United States,"
2020-03-17,01:03:28,Donald Trump,"We’ve been very tough on those states. I know exactly who you’re talking about. We’ve been very tough on them. Thank you. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-17,01:03:35,Unnamed,"Just a follow-up question on the testing. You’ve been telling us for days now that millions of tests have been sent out. Why have fewer than 60,000 people actually been tested?"
2020-03-17,01:03:43,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think you will see different numbers this week. You’ve heard just at 8,000. Remember all of these tests, the high-speed tests were approved last Friday night and last Thursday night. I think if I could talk to Thermo Fisher and the other groups that have these platforms out there. Do not rely on a pull technology. Push out those tests because we can only make them available, groups have to order them. We’ve been talking to Thermo Fisher, one of the key platforms to push out tests based on need and not wait for orders."
2020-03-17,01:04:20,Unnamed,Is that where the issue is getting the tests out or is it getting the test conducted?
2020-03-17,01:04:25,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That’s a great question. I know part of it is getting the test out right now. I think the Admiral and others are working on getting the issues related to getting the test conducted. Obviously, that does take time. He is working on innovative solutions that are creative and sustainable that will be a game changer in testing, but we don’t have the data yet. This is a critical comparitor. Can you do it yourself? Can you actually sample yourself? These are the kinds of things we’re working on right now. He’s getting the data for us."
2020-03-17,01:04:55,Mike Pence,It’s coming on line every day.
2020-03-17,01:04:56,Donald Trump,"The states are actually doing a lot of it. The governors and the states are doing a lot of it with even our tests. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, please."
2020-03-17,01:05:05,Unnamed,"Thank you. Can you give us a sense of how long these tough new restrictions will need to be in place until we start to see the rate of this virus going down? Also, can you speak to this study that as many as 2.2 million people in the United States could die if there weren’t this type of action by the government taken? To what extent did that prompt what we saw yesterday?"
2020-03-17,01:05:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think models are models. They’re based on input. They’re based on infectiousness without any controls. I can tell you we’ve never seen that level of infections that modeled up to that 2.2 million in mortality. We are looking at that. We are having a particularly model meeting tomorrow. I think that’s really going to be important. I’ve dealt with a lot of modelers in my time. They’re wonderful people, but they all have their favorite inputs and they all have their favorite integration functions. We’re evaluating all of those so we can integrate and create the best model for the United States based on the best data. That first set of recommendations you saw were based on what we could do today to prevent anything that looks like that."
2020-03-17,01:06:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"If I could just say one other thing to the hospitals and dentists out there. Things that don’t need to be done over the next two weeks, don’t get it done. If you’re a person with an elective surgery, you don’t want to go into a hospital right now. There’s a lot of distraction. There’s a lot of people doing a lot of other things to save people’s lives. Let’s all be responsible and cancel things that we can cancel to really free up hospital beds and space. Then let’s do everything that we can to ensure that we don’t need the ventilators because we’ve protected the people who would have needed to use them."
2020-03-17,01:06:50,Unnamed,"Are you looking at the possibility of more actions like for example, limiting travel within the United States? Are you looking-"
2020-03-17,01:06:55,Donald Trump,"It’s possible. It’s possible. We’ll see how it goes. There’s been great cooperation with the local governments, states. We’ll see how it goes. It’s going right now pretty well. Yeah. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-17,01:07:08,Unnamed,"Can I have a follow on that, Mr. President, very quickly, just very quickly?"
2020-03-17,01:07:09,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-03-17,01:07:11,Unnamed,Do you need to invoke the Defense Production Act to get more of those medical supplies to different hospitals across-
2020-03-17,01:07:16,Donald Trump,"We’re able to do that if we have to. Right now we haven’t had to, but it’s certainly ready if I want it. We can do it very quickly. We’ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We’ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we don’t need it. It’s a big step."
2020-03-17,01:07:31,Unnamed,Because the states really need more help from the federal government when it comes to those supplies.
2020-03-17,01:07:33,Donald Trump,When you say the states-
2020-03-17,01:07:34,Unnamed,What do you say to those governors?
2020-03-17,01:07:35,Donald Trump,"In particular, three states need some help. Some states have two people, three people, no people. In the case of, again, West Virginia. We’re looking at it very closely. We’ve taken it apart 15 different ways. It’s a very difficult thing to do. It’s a very big step. If we need that step, we’ll take it. Okay."
2020-03-17,01:07:55,John (Reporter),"Quick follow up the first question, a lot of people have got travel to places that aren’t considered hotspots, the Caribbean, Mexico, that sort of thing over the next few weeks. Would you recommend that they follow through with those plans?"
2020-03-17,01:08:06,Donald Trump,"I would just say enjoy your home, stay. I would just say right now we have to get this problem fixed and then we’ll get back into business really quick. We’ll open up our country. We’ll open up our society. The world will hopefully open up. We see areas of the world that haven’t done well. We see areas that are doing very well. I would put us in the category of doing very well for a country so big. I think that I would recommend that they just enjoy their living room."
2020-03-17,01:08:39,Donald Trump,"Yeah, go ahead please."
2020-03-17,01:08:40,Unnamed,What do you say to people who are not heeding these guidelines from the White House? Then also I have a question on asymptomatic people for Doctor Birx.
2020-03-17,01:08:49,Donald Trump,"I’m not happy with those people if they’re not, but those people are being shouted down by other people. They know it. It’s almost like self-policing. People went in. There were a couple of instances, I guess, probably more than a couple of where people are not happy when they see others doing what they’re not supposed to be doing. We have to get rid of this. We have to win this war and ideally quickly, quickly. Because the longer it takes, it’s not a good situation. I’m not even talking about the economy. I’m talking about the lives of a lot of people."
2020-03-17,01:09:19,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please. Did you have one?"
2020-03-17,01:09:20,Unnamed,Will the White House put any restrictions on corporate bonuses for companies that do get bailed out like airlines?
2020-03-17,01:09:28,Donald Trump,"I think I’m going to ask Mike, answer that question."
2020-03-17,01:09:32,Mike Pence,"I think it’s all a work in progress. What President Trump has made clear to industries around the country is that we’re going to do whatever it takes. We understand this is an extraordinary moment in the life of our nation. It’s the reason why the President brought in leaders of the financial sector, the airline industry. He’ll meet with all additional industry leaders today in tourism and hospitality. But he has tasked the Secretary of the Treasury to work with members of Congress in both parties to make sure that we construct the kind of economic support that will allow those industries to weather the period of the coronavirus and then to come back stronger than ever before."
2020-03-17,01:10:12,Unnamed,Question for Dr. Fauci.
2020-03-17,01:10:13,Donald Trump,We’ve had so much incredible … I don’t know. It’s almost the word spirit is the best word. It’s like a spirit.
2020-03-17,01:10:21,Mike Pence,It’s true.
2020-03-17,01:10:21,Donald Trump,"The banks have come in. The banks are doing things that they would’ve never done. They’re working on extensions and lots of things that they wouldn’t have done. Copays with regard to the insurance companies, I mean for them to be doing what they’re doing. You know all about the copays. They would have never done that. They did it. They were in my office. I would say the 11 biggest in this country, I guess probably the 11 biggest of the world. The big ones, all the big ones. They did things on copay that nobody would be doing that they wouldn’t have done in a million years, but they’re doing it. There’s a great spirit going on right now in the country. You want to … yes, please."
2020-03-17,01:10:56,Unnamed,"Question for Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci, you’ve said you liked being accused of overreacting because that is an indication we may be doing things necessary to beat this, bend the curve."
2020-03-17,01:11:09,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Right.
2020-03-17,01:11:10,Unnamed,"How long do you think it will take for you to be confident that yes, we’re bending the curve or no, we’re not?"
2020-03-17,01:11:18,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I can’t give you a firm number on that because the dynamics of outbreaks in some respects are predictable historically. They do this and that. We don’t know because this is really unprecedented. I mean of all the outbreaks that I’ve been involved with over the last at least 36 years and then going historically back, we’ve never had a situation where the mobilization of all the different components, travel restrictions, internal containment, mitigation, financial assistance, public health assistance, testing. We don’t really know."
2020-03-17,01:11:52,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"But the one thing I do know, I do know that if you look at models with all of their vicissitudes of models is that when you have input into the kinds of mitigations and things that we’re doing, we’re going to see a hump instead of a peak. I would be really surprised if all the things that we’re doing, and this is really a comprehensive approach. I was struck as I was listening to everyone make their presentations. I’m a scientist. I’m a health person. I’m a physician who sees patients. I look at it from one particular standpoint. But what I’m being impressed by is that this is really a comprehensive thing that has multiple components to it. All of them got to succeed if we’re going to get to that end point that I’ve described multiple times from this podium. I hope that if everyone does their job, we’re going to be able to give you a number and say, “We’ve seen that inflection and we’re coming down. I would hesitate to do it now to be honest with you because it might be misleading and I don’t want to be misleading. I just want to say one other thing because I heard Dr. Birx say it. I think we need to say it over and over again. When I was young a long time ago, I felt that I was invulnerable the way I think many of us feel we’re invulnerable. When we’re asking the young people to help us with this mitigation strategy by staying out of the bars, staying out of the restaurants, really trying to distance yourself. Don’t get the attitude, “I’m young. I’m invulnerable.” In some respects, you’re certainly less vulnerable than I am. However, what you might inadvertently do, and I know you don’t want to do that, you don’t want to put your loved ones at risk, particularly the ones who are elderly and the ones who have compromised conditions. We can’t do this without the young people cooperating. Please cooperate with us. Thank you."
2020-03-17,01:13:53,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, and I’m going to read my notes so I’ll get this right, but there apparently a new study out of China. It found that the vast majority of cases, 86%, were untested patients with mild to no symptoms. What does that say about the impact of testing? Does it mean that testing should actually go beyond the sickest patients?"
2020-03-17,01:14:15,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That question keeps coming up. I’m not going to evade the question, but I want to make a point. We tend to think that we’re not going to be able to mitigate or contain without testing. They compliment each other in some respects, but they’re separate channels. Even if we had no testing, we should be doing what we’re doing now. The question you’re asking so I won’t evade is specifically, “Would it be important outside of a doctor, a patient coming in together of knowing what’s out there, what might be under the radar screen?”"
2020-03-17,01:14:47,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The answer to your question is yes. Let me tell you what the CDC is doing right now. They’re going out there and part of their program is to get a feel for what is there that wasn’t initially thought to be coronavirus, that was thought to be something else. When you do that, you’re also going to get a feel of what the penetrance is in society. We are heading with the high-throughput things that you’ve been hearing about to get an answer to your question."
2020-03-17,01:15:15,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, Governor Cuomo said this morning he believes that we’ll see a peak in terms of infection in 45 days. Would you concur with that?"
2020-03-17,01:15:25,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You know it’s possible. I know that the Governor has been really, I believe doing a really good job of trying to stay ahead of this. 45 days is not unreasonable. You have to be careful when you get a number. You own the number and then if the number doesn’t come out, you’re in trouble. That’s the reason why from our standpoint, from the federal government, we’re talking about a range. Within that range, it isn’t like you want to be correct for the sake of being correct, but you don’t want to be wed to something and then have to back off."
2020-03-17,01:15:56,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-03-17,01:15:58,Unnamed,When is the soonest that we’ll know that these new guidelines are actually bending the curve and are actually working? Is there a point in time where in the next couple of weeks where you’ll be able to tell the President more draconian measures are needed?
2020-03-17,01:16:16,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What’s happening, I mean if you look as a metaphor, it’s kind of like a race against the virus. If left to its own devices will do this and us trying to somehow blunt that. Now you could see the virus going up and up and your effect, your work, what you’re trying to do, may actually be having an effect. But you may not see it because it’ll still be going up. As you’re trying to implement your interference with the virus, you may not realize that you are actually interfering."
2020-03-17,01:16:49,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You’ll say, “Wait a minute. It’s still going up. What’s going on? You’ve done nothing.” But you don’t know whether it would do this versus that. The answer to your question, it probably would be several weeks and maybe longer before we know whether we’re having an effect. It may be at the end of the day we’ll see a curve that would have been way, way up, but I wouldn’t put us to task every few days. “Wait a minute? It’s going up. Is it working or not?” That would be really misleading if we do that."
2020-03-17,01:17:19,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-03-17,01:17:20,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, I have a question regarding the 15-day guidelines which were announced yesterday. One of those guidelines was a recommendation against gatherings of 10 or more people. Today, the governor of Alabama issued her own guidelines. It was a recommendation against gatherings of 25 or more people. What is your recommendation for people of Alabama, people across all of the country as far as the guidelines that were announced yesterday by the federal government?"
2020-03-17,01:17:53,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"One thing we don’t want to do is to get hung up on the difference between 10 and 25. I think you might agree with that. When we give guidelines, they’re only guidelines. We sit down. We look at the data. As Dr. Birx said, we’re data-driven. We say, “On different models, 10 looks good.” If someone wants to do 25, we’re not going to fault them. But if someone wants to come to us and ask us what we think the best is, we stand by the numbers. It isn’t perfect. It isn’t precise math. It’s assumptions and it’s data that make you get your decision."
2020-03-17,01:18:30,Unnamed,But would it be more effective if every state and every city in the country was playing by the same rules-
2020-03-17,01:18:33,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Yes-
2020-03-17,01:18:34,Unnamed,… instead of different?
2020-03-17,01:18:34,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Of course, but this is the United States of America. There’s a lot of free enterprise there. People do their own thing. Quite frankly, I don’t think there’s a big deal difference between 10 and 25. We got many, many more important things to worry about than that difference."
2020-03-17,01:18:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I thank you. What about the supply chains and then talking about preparedness for the future? Yesterday Larry Kudlow said that there was an idea of floating around the administration to cut taxes for companies who would be bringing their supply chains back to United States. He said he specifically liked immediate 100% write-offs for structures, equipment. But he said you hadn’t endorsed that yet. Would you endorse an idea like that?"
2020-03-17,01:19:11,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at many ideas. That’s one of them, frankly. We’re looking at creating incentives for companies. Not only that type of company, but other companies. We’re also looking to help companies such as the airline industry, within the airline industry. We’ll be doing that. We will be doing that. This is not their fault. They’ve been very understanding actually. We’re going to be helping them. We will have a very powerful airline industry. It’ll start up as soon as this is over. We’ll have those planes ready to go. We have to help them during the short term. It’s very important."
2020-03-17,01:19:45,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-03-17,01:19:46,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to know, have you taken a look at some of these models such as the Imperial College London model? That kind of poses a very difficult choice, whether it’s shutting down society or overwhelming the healthcare system? Is that something that you been considering?"
2020-03-17,01:20:01,Donald Trump,"We’ve looked at every model. We’ve relied on the very talented people and there’s no better team than the people behind me. I will say that all of the people that have done those models are all in constant touch with Dr. Birx and Tony and everybody that you’ve been hearing so much from over the last couple of weeks. We’ve looked at many different models. The model we have is we want to save a lot of lives. We want to save a lot of lives. If we get too steep on that curve, you’re going to lose a lot of lives, perhaps unnecessarily."
2020-03-17,01:20:32,Donald Trump,"Now we’re going to find out, everything has a risk. We’re going to see. But if people do what we’re telling them to do, what we’re asking them to do, you’re going to see the saving of a lot of lives. Now, Boris, in UK yesterday, you saw what happened. It looked like they were going a different way, but then he went away of similar, I guess similar, I don’t know exactly. But I would say we had a conversation yesterday similar to what we’re doing. A lot of people seem to think this is going to be … we are looking to save the maximum number of lives."
2020-03-17,01:21:02,Donald Trump,"We are looking to save the maximum number of lives. Everything else is going to come back. A life is never going to come back, but everything else, our economy is going to come roaring back. You’re going to know. We’re going to know. We’re going to all know that day. Somebody was asking about the day. When will you know? When will you know? We’re going to know. All of a sudden we’re going to say, “Wow, that’s looking good. That’s looking good. That’s looking good.” We’re going to be on the other side of the curve, and that’s a day that we look forward to. Okay?"
2020-03-17,01:21:25,Unnamed,"Is there something, sir, that you saw this week though that that made you decide that, yes, now is the time to implement these much more stringent social-distancing measures? This week [crosstalk 01:21:37]"
2020-03-17,01:21:36,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t think so. This is where we’re going. I really think from the beginning, this is where we were going. This is what we had in mind. We’re just going step by step. That was the next step. The next logical step as Dr. Fauci said and I think very importantly, one of the most important things when you write the history of this was the fact that we closed it down to China and Europe, but in particular China, we closed it down to China, the source very, very early, very, very early, far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. I think in the end that’s going to be, that will have saved a tremendous number of lives."
2020-03-17,01:22:14,Unnamed,"A quick follow-up, one on the economy and the other on the broader picture here, but just to follow up on my colleague, some people did note that your tone seemed more somber yesterday. You talked about that August timeline. Did you see a projection? Some people thought perhaps that two million potentially that could die, maybe prompted part of that. Was there a shift in tone?"
2020-03-17,01:22:35,Donald Trump,"I mean I have seen that where people actually liked it, but I didn’t feel different. I’ve always known this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do is look at other countries. I think now it’s in almost 120 countries all over the world. No, I’ve always viewed it as very series. There was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t."
2020-03-17,01:23:03,Unnamed,Last one of the economy. Your former economic advisor said almost a 100% chance of a recession. Do you see it that way?
2020-03-17,01:23:10,Donald Trump,"It could be. I mean, I don’t think in terms of recession. I think in terms of getting it out, because when we’re finished with the virus, we will win. We will win, and when that victory takes place, our economy’s going to go through the roof. It is so pent up. It is so built up. It is so ready to go in an upward direction, but we have to knock out this enemy. This is a really tough enemy, but we have to knock out, all of us. That’s all of us. I don’t think in terms of recession, not recession, it’s words. We have to knock out this and we will have an economy. I actually think we’ll have an economy like we’ve never had before. It’s all pent up. Did you have something say Mike?"
2020-03-17,01:23:46,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-17,01:23:47,Mike Pence,"Well, I think the question about the actions that the president’s authorized beginning in January when he took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China, the efforts to issue travel advisories for portions of Italy and South Korea and then to begin screening all the passengers, the efforts regarding suspending travel from Europe and what went into effect at midnight last night, adding the UK and Ireland to that have all been informed by the experts that are surrounding us. What the president’s asked us to do from the very beginning as a Dr. Burks and Dr. Fauci often say is let’s follow the data, bring the president the best options in response to what is actually happening on the ground."
2020-03-17,01:24:33,Mike Pence,"But with regard to yesterday’s 15-day slow the spread plan, our team unanimously brought to the president these very strong recommendations for every American because we truly believe we are at a point in this epidemic in our country when we can reduce the number of people that actually are exposed to or contract the coronavirus. But we’ll continue to bring the best data, the best evidence, and the best recommendations, frankly, of the best health experts in the world, and the president will continue to make decisions that put the health of America first."
2020-03-17,01:25:11,Donald Trump,"In other words, reduce the number of people that die. That’s what we’re trying to do. When you do the steep curve, a lot of people are going to die. A lot of people. The worst ever, they say 1918, and I don’t have to go into the numbers, but they were unbelievable numbers. Had they known and had they done what we had now, it would’ve been a very much different story. It would still be tragic, but it would have been a very much different. But that was the one that people write about. That was an incredible pandemic like we haven’t seen, but we have done something that, I hope, hopefully we will all have made the right moves. We’re all in this together including you and we want to see fair press."
2020-03-17,01:25:57,Donald Trump,"I’ll tell you what it’s been, generally speaking, I think it’s been a great thing to see. Getting along with Democrats getting along with Republicans for the Democrats themselves. There’s been a lot of spirit. There’s been a lot of things happening that I haven’t seen happen in the first almost now three and a half years. It’s been very nice to see. That’s one of the good things, but really the good thing is we have to knock it out. We have to win and we want to keep that slope as low as possible because that’s a lot of lives in there. Let’s go back there for somebody that didn’t get one, please. Go ahead."
2020-03-17,01:26:34,Unnamed,"Mr. President, this is had a huge impact on China’s economy as well. Have you received any indication from officials there that they’re going to have trouble meeting the purchase agreements part of the phase-one deal, particularly the agricultural buy?"
2020-03-17,01:26:47,Donald Trump,"Well, they need our product very badly. No, I haven’t received any. Good relationship with China. I have not received anything to that. No, we have a signed agreement. They’re going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product."
2020-03-17,01:26:59,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-03-17,01:27:00,Unnamed,"Earlier today Dr. Burks was talking about the possibility of our hospital system being overburdened, overtaxed and she talked about the certain options that are available to the United States if that happens, including VA hospitals, Department of Defense, medical treatment facilities, and even hospitals shifts. At what point do you tap into those options?"
2020-03-17,01:27:22,Donald Trump,"Well, I’ll know the point by speaking with Governor Cuomo and other governors, we’re going to know the points. It’s going to be different for New York then it’s going to be for Iowa or from Idaho or from West Virginia, frankly, or for any. It’s different. New York has got a big problem. The state of Washington has a big problem. California has some big problems. Everyone’s doing a good job, but we’re going to know when it will be."
2020-03-17,01:27:47,Donald Trump,"I believe it’ll be more spot that it will be, it’s not going to be the whole thing. It’s going to be spots. There are some hotspots that are in trouble, big trouble, and there are other areas that are in no trouble at all. They watch it on television. They don’t know. It’s just not affecting them. They’re lucky. They’re lucky. But there are areas of the country that don’t have much of a problem and some that don’t have any problem, they’re not going to have a problem with hospitals. But some areas like New York, California, state of Washington, they’re going to have some difficulty. When we see that coming, we’re going to be in there. We’re already making preparation for it."
2020-03-17,01:28:24,John (Reporter),"Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, your trade advisor Peter Navarro had been recommending an executive order that would ensure that the raw materials for pharmaceuticals and medical devices are manufactured here in the United States. We were getting some indications last week that you were close to signing this executive order. Can you tell us where you are on that?"
2020-03-17,01:28:42,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re looking at different things, John. I don’t want to say exactly right now. China has been sending us everything we need but we’re looking at some alternatives. Yes, we are looking for alternatives."
2020-03-17,01:28:53,Donald Trump,"And we have other places. Ireland does a lot of work for us. You know that. In that world, in the pharma world. A very tremendous producer and we are looking to bring a lot more back home."
2020-03-17,01:29:06,Donald Trump,"Excuse me, you know me for a long time, I’ve been talking about this for many years, long before I decided to run for president, I’ve been talking about this. We have to be able to take care of our country and that was one of the many things on the list, so we’ll be talking about it. But we are discussing it and Marco is very much involved and Peter is very much involved. A lot of people are involved. A lot of people feel that way. But we’ll be discussing. Let’s go, please."
2020-03-17,01:29:32,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Canada has closed its borders to non-citizens, are you considering-"
2020-03-17,01:29:38,Donald Trump,Not to the United States.
2020-03-17,01:29:39,Unnamed,"Not to the United States, of course. Are you considering closing the land borders in the United States? Also you’ve discussed-"
2020-03-17,01:29:43,Donald Trump,"Well, Canada has not closed it to the United States."
2020-03-17,01:29:45,Unnamed,"Right, right."
2020-03-17,01:29:45,Donald Trump,"We’re working very closely with Canada. But they have not closed it. They have closed it to the world, but they have not closed it to the United States."
2020-03-17,01:29:52,Unnamed,Are considering closing the US land borders?
2020-03-17,01:29:54,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to say that, but we are discussing things with Canada and we’re discussing things with Mexico, quite honestly. Again, the relationship is outstanding with both. Outstanding. We just signed our deal, USMCA, and the relationship is very strong."
2020-03-17,01:30:10,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-03-17,01:30:13,Unnamed,China and others have criticized you for using the phrase “Chinese virus.” How do you feel about that? Are you going to continue using that phrase?
2020-03-17,01:30:21,Donald Trump,"Well, China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false. Rather than having an argument, I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. I think it’s a very accurate term. But no, I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody."
2020-03-17,01:30:45,Unnamed,Critics say using that phrase creates a stigma.
2020-03-17,01:30:47,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t think so. No. I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma."
2020-03-17,01:30:55,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-17,01:30:56,Unnamed,"When you speak to travel and tourism executives today, what specific help are you going to offer to them if at all? Or is it still vague?"
2020-03-17,01:31:05,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to help. They need help. Look, let’s face it. You know they go from having record-breaking years. This is the third year of record-breaking years. Travel and tourism, airlines, everything. They were doing record numbers, ordering new planes, building new hotels. Everything was really a hunky dory. Then one day we hear about this rumor in China and then we find out it’s much more than a rumor and then all of a sudden we make a great decision to close it up early. It would be a whole different world. It would be a whole different world, but we make a decision to close it up to China and all of a sudden tourism. Then we close it up to Europe, which people never heard of this before. I’m not sure that that’s ever been done. I know that when I made the decision to close it China people told me that’s never been done before, but it was a great decision."
2020-03-17,01:31:55,Donald Trump,"We make good decisions. I’ll tell you my best decision. The people behind me are total pros. All over the world, they’re respected. Dr. Burks, Anthony, who’s become a … Where’s Anthony. He’s become a major television star for all the right reasons. No, he’s just so professional, so good. The people that we have working here have been incredible. They’re totally respected."
2020-03-17,01:32:21,Donald Trump,"The admiral has been incredible having to do with the testing. Incredible. He’s viewing this as testing also for the future. We’re building a platform. When we took over this platform, first thing the admiral said was “This was not designed for what we’re talking about. Millions of people.” It wasn’t."
2020-03-17,01:32:38,Donald Trump,It’s nobody’s fault. It’s not like who could have ever predicted a thing like this? But we broke it down and it’s really going to be an incredible system. It is now a great system.
2020-03-17,01:32:47,Donald Trump,I just want to say these are incredible people standing behind me. They’re the most respected in the world. Every country that you’ve mentioned today so far has called them and they call them all the time for advice. There’s nobody better than what we have.
2020-03-17,01:33:04,Unnamed,Why haven’t we seen Dr. Redfield the last couple of days?
2020-03-17,01:33:06,Donald Trump,I don’t know. I can’t imagine.
2020-03-17,01:33:08,Unnamed,He’s in Atlanta running the CDC. [crosstalk 01:33:10]
2020-03-17,01:33:10,Donald Trump,I can tell you he’s doing a good job. We’re very happy with him.
2020-03-17,01:33:15,Donald Trump,"Please, you have it. Go ahead."
2020-03-17,01:33:16,Unnamed,"Mr. President, yesterday we were being told that the payroll tax was going to comprise the lion’s share of the fiscal stimulus."
2020-03-17,01:33:24,Donald Trump,Right.
2020-03-17,01:33:24,Unnamed,We also had the markets fall quite dramatically yesterday. Did that inform your-
2020-03-17,01:33:33,Donald Trump,It wasn’t about the payroll tax.
2020-03-17,01:33:34,Unnamed,Did that inform your decision? What made you make that change and when did you make that change?
2020-03-17,01:33:41,Donald Trump,"Well, I didn’t make a change. We’re looking at payroll tax and we’re looking at various other forms of getting money to people. The payroll tax is something that I’ve always liked. The problem is, it does take a period of time, months before they really see something. We don’t really have months in terms of people living. You have people that work on tips. It’s a large number of people. Who would think this, right? And they do nicely. They work very hard, but they work on tips. We have to take care of our people. We don’t want to have people suffering during this period. It wasn’t their fault that this thing all of a sudden was upon us. We’re looking at various, we’re also looking at payroll tax. It’s possible. It’s also possible we’ll do a percentage of payroll tax and then other things. But we’d like to be able to get money to people. We’re very lucky. Our country’s doing so well. We can do this and we can do it easily, but we have to do it. I have to say Mitch McConnell, if you look at Mitch and Kevin and the whole group and it’s been incredible how they’re reacting, how Congress is reacting, whether it’s the House or Senate, how they’re moving. I’m talking about Democrats and Republicans, but we’ve had a tremendous leadership meetings and they want to see it done right, and they do want to go big."
2020-03-17,01:34:58,Donald Trump,"I think going big is important. I don’t think we want to go up there every day with a different idea, a different concept. Oh gee, let’s worry about the airlines. Let’s do this one. You have a big problem with the cruise ship industry. It’s an industry that we’re setting all sorts of records two months ago. Then all of a sudden there’s nobody on the ships. Okay? We have to help these. These are great industry. These are going to be taking care of people and passengers and for years to come and paying tremendous taxes, tremendous taxes for years to come. We have to make sure that this is done."
2020-03-17,01:35:29,Donald Trump,"Yes, John?"
2020-03-17,01:35:30,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, I want to bring up what you referred to just a short while ago about politics. In your address to the nation, you said we have to put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together, but this morning you criticize the Democratic governor of Michigan. Yesterday, it was the Democratic governor of New York. You’ve attacked Obama. You attacked Biden. In fact, every day except one since that address you’ve lashed out a Democratic leader. Are you going to set the example?"
2020-03-17,01:35:59,Donald Trump,"I only do that when I have to respond. I watched her on television. She said something that was false and therefore I did do that and I will continue to do that. If they’re not going to play fair because you know they have the media on their side. I don’t. I just have me. If they’re not going to play fair, I’m going to do that. If they are going to play fair, there’s going to be nobody."
2020-03-17,01:36:19,John (Reporter),[crosstalk 00:15:19].
2020-03-17,01:36:19,Donald Trump,"There’s going to be nobody better than Donald Trump in terms of a bipartisanship. But if they’re going to say things that are false, like the story that was written yesterday. A lot of people, I don’t know somebody, I think I know who, but they taped the conference call that I had with the governors. It was a good call. It was fine. I assume somebody’s going to tape it. They handed it to various people and one of them was the New York Times and the New York Times chose to write totally inaccurately about it. It was a disgraceful thing. It was bad journalism, but they do a lot of bad journalism. But we respond to that, and actually people get it. People get it. No, I want it to be bipartisan and nobody’s going to be better than me, but when they attack me or the people, these incredible people behind me, I’m not going to let them get away with that. I can’t do that."
2020-03-17,01:37:05,Donald Trump,"Okay. How about one or two more questions? Go ahead, please. Please."
2020-03-17,01:37:09,Unnamed,"You said that the 15-day guidelines was the next natural step. Is the next natural step after that a national lockdown, similar to what San Francisco is doing?"
2020-03-17,01:37:16,Donald Trump,"Well, you can do a national lockdown. Hopefully, we’re not going to need that. We think of everything. I mean we have every idea that you mentioned we’ve thought of. It’s a very big step. That’s a step that, I mean in one sense it would work. It’s a very big step. It’s something we talk about, but we haven’t decided to do that. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-17,01:37:34,Unnamed,"Mr. President, what would be the determining factors for you to take that action?"
2020-03-17,01:37:42,Donald Trump,"I just don’t think it’s going to be an action that we’re going to take. I don’t think I’ll talk, but Anthony, all of the people standing behind me, we’d get together in a room plus some additionals and we would make a decision, but I don’t think that’s a step that we’re going to be taking."
2020-03-17,01:37:56,Donald Trump,"One more question. You didn’t have one, did you? Come on."
2020-03-17,01:37:59,Unnamed,Will the US government provide financial assistance to Boeing and airplane suppliers like GE?
2020-03-17,01:38:05,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at that. We’re certainly looking at Boeing. Boeing got hit hard in many different ways. Boeing never had a problem for years. It was unthinkable what happened with respect to Boeing. Unthinkable. Probably I would consider it the greatest company in the world prior to a year ago. Now they get hit in 15 different ways and they have different management. I’ve met the new people running Boeing. I think it’s going to be outstanding. But yeah, we have to protect Boeing. We have to absolutely help Boeing. They were doing a job. It was coming along well and then all of a sudden this hits. Obviously, when the airlines aren’t doing well, Boeing’s not going to be doing well, so we’ll helping Boeing. Yeah."
2020-03-17,01:38:50,Unnamed,"Mr. President, before you leave, on what John was saying, you’ve called for people to leave politics out of this. Joe Biden said the World Health Organization offered testing kits that they had available to the United States and they’d give it to us now. We refused it. We didn’t want to buy them. PolitiFact says the WHO never made that offer. Can you tell us what actually happened?"
2020-03-17,01:39:11,Donald Trump,"That’s what I heard. I’m going to let Tony answer that question or whoever’s best at answering that. But I do have to say, when you talk about politics, I watched the debate, not too exciting, but what they said about me, and we’ve done a great job when you talk about not being bipartisan, what they said about me. If you look at a swine flu, the whole thing in I guess it was 2009 and what they did and the mistakes they’ve made, they were terrible. They were horrific mistakes. 17,000 people died. I’ll be honest, they shouldn’t be criticizing because we’ve done a fantastic job."
2020-03-17,01:39:51,Donald Trump,"The only thing we haven’t done well is to get good press. We’ve done a fantastic job, but it hasn’t been appreciated. Even the closing down of the borders, which had never been done, and not only did we close them, but we’d close them early. The press doesn’t like writing about it. We’ve done a poor job on press relationships. I guess I don’t know who to blame for that. I don’t know. Maybe I can blame ourselves for that? I will blame ourselves. But I think we’ve done a great job. I think we’ve done a poor job in terms of press relationship. But let me have somebody answer your question."
2020-03-17,01:40:24,Dr. Deborah Birx,I can.
2020-03-17,01:40:25,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-17,01:40:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, so I tried to cover this in the answer when I talked about quality of kits. Our quality analysis runs through the FDA. All of these platforms we have asked people to submit and we’ve asked states to quality control. I mean, anybody could submit their test to us. We don’t buy tests that haven’t been quality controlled and they show us the data. Either show us the data upfront or show us the data after they’ve been running them because quality testing for our American people is paramount to us. It doesn’t help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positive. Imagine what that would mean to the American people. Imagine their level of concern now and telling people that they’re false positive. We take this same approach to HIV. Imagine telling someone they were positive to HIV and they weren’t. That is our bottom line, the customer, the American people first. Any of these groups can submit their testing kits through our regulatory processes, but without that and without a plan, we are not going to accept tests that have not been studied by us."
2020-03-17,01:41:39,Donald Trump,Good answer. That’s a good answer. Would you have something on that?
2020-03-17,01:41:42,Unnamed,"I’m just going to emphasize a little bit more on that. When I became involved in the testing world, I called as senior officials at the WHO as I could find to understand what the situation was. As far as I can tell from sources that should know, no one ever offered a test that we refused."
2020-03-17,01:42:02,Donald Trump,That’s what I heard too.
2020-03-17,01:42:04,Unnamed,"This is a research-grade test, right? Research-grade test that was never submit-"
2020-03-17,01:42:09,Unnamed,Not approved.
2020-03-17,01:42:09,Unnamed,"Not approved, not submitted to the FDA, that was supplied in tens of thousands of quantities to a hundred countries in the world. Okay? I think there’s a lot that people are saying about this. This is based on rumor and myth. Nothing was offered that we refused. It was a research test that was not approved. Again, there was a small number that we have greatly surpassed in a very short period of time."
2020-03-17,01:42:31,Donald Trump,"Number one, nothing was offered. Number two, it was a bad test. Otherwise, it was wonderful."
2020-03-17,01:42:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,Joe Biden [crosstalk 01:42:37]
2020-03-17,01:42:37,Donald Trump,"Listen, thank you very much. No, he made a mistake. I assume that he’ll apologize for that mistake. Thank you all very much. We’ll be back."
2020-03-17,01:42:45,Mike Pence,Thank you all.
2020-03-18,19:18,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus. We’ll be invoking the defense production act just in case we need it. In other words, I think you all know what it is and it can do a lot of good things if we need it and we will have it all completed signing it in just a little while. Right after I’m finished with this conference, I’ll be signing it. It’s prepared to go. So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act. Last week I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which is we invoked previously and which activated FEMA National Response Coordination Center, FEMA is fully engaged at the highest levels."
2020-03-18,20:16,Donald Trump,"Today FEMA is activated in every region. We are at level one, level one being the highest level which we will work with and we’ve been working with FEMA. I’ve done a lot of work with FEMA. They’re incredible. It’s always been on hurricanes or tornadoes. There right now in Tennessee, a large group working in Tennessee have been incredible. It was tragic event Alabama last year, also a tornado and then obviously the numerous hurricanes in different locations that were in some cases very devastating and in every case FEMA came through. This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do."
2020-03-18,21:02,Donald Trump,"We have tremendous people, tremendous talent in FEMA. We’re sending upon request the two hospital ships, they’re being prepared right now. They’re massive ships. They’re the big white ships with the red cross on the sides. One is called The Mercy and the other is called The Comfort and they are in tiptop shape. They soon will be. They’re getting ready to come up to New York. I spoke with governor Cuomo about it. He’s excited about it. We haven’t made the final determination as to where it’s going to go on the West coast. The Comfort is located now in San Diego and it’s going to be… We’ll be picking the destination fairly shortly, so those two ships are being prepared to go and they can be launched over the next week or so depending on need."
2020-03-18,21:56,Donald Trump,"Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington state, as you probably know. The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January, but thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we’ve reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later. It’s a record by many, many months. It used to take years to do this and now we did it just in a very short while. That’s the fastest development in history of what we’re doing with regard to the vaccine and making very, very big progress."
2020-03-18,22:36,Donald Trump,"Today I can announce further steps to expand testing capacity. We’re working with several groups to determine if the self swab a much easier process than the current process. That’s a not very nice to do. I can tell you because I did it. But we have a current process that’s a little bit difficult. If you haven’t done. The groups are working on determining if a self swab by an individual is as effective as the other. The others very effective, very accurate but we’re going to see if we can do a self swab which would be a lot more popular. I can tell you that. So and that would be administered also by a health official but it would be a lot easier to do. The fact is that the health professionals would… It would free up a lot. Let me just say the self swab is what it is. It’s a self swab. You do it yourself."
2020-03-18,23:40,Donald Trump,"The other has to be issued by a health professional and it’s something that is quite difficult and we think it’s working out for the self swab. If it would test positive that people would go and they would do what they have to do, but we think that’s probably working out. I’ve asked the FDA to cut through the red tape and reduce regulatory barriers. We are looking at some very exciting things and I’m going to be holding the second news conference either today. We’re going to talk about the FDA. Some things are happening that are quite exciting and we’re going to be doing that either later today or tomorrow, fairly early tomorrow. So we’ll see what happens. But the FDA, my instructions is I’ve been working very, very hard on a number of developments and we’ll be discussing that with you later today or tomorrow."
2020-03-18,24:35,Donald Trump,This afternoon I’ll be meeting with nurses on the front lines of the battle against the virus. They’re truly American heroes. They want to get it done. They’re incredible people. So we’re going to be meeting with nurses and I actually look forward to that. Very brave. They’re taking a lot of risk and they have done an incredible job and they never complain.
2020-03-18,24:59,Donald Trump,Today I’m also announcing that the department of housing and urban development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. So we’re working very closely with Dr. Ben Carson and everybody from HUD. Every generation of American has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation.
2020-03-18,25:23,Donald Trump,In World War II young people in their teenage years volunteered to fight. They wanted to fight so badly because they love our country. Workers refuse to go home and slept in factory floors to keep assembly lines running. The numbers of ships that they built during World War II to this day has never… Nothing like that has ever been equal. They were doing ships literally on a daily basis. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it and to this day nobody seen anything like that. What they were able to do during World War II and now it’s our time. We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we’ll come through together.
2020-03-18,26:03,Donald Trump,"We are all in this together and we’ll come through together. It’s the invisible enemy. That’s always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy, but we are going to defeat the invisible enemy. I think we’re going to do it even faster than we thought and it will be a complete victory. It’ll be a total victory."
2020-03-18,26:19,Donald Trump,"So we’ll have a second conference, again having to do with the FDA on this. I think it’s going to be potentially a very exciting news conference and we will do it as quickly as we can, so whether it’s today or tomorrow. And I’ll, with that, ask, Mike Pence to say a few words and thank you very much."
2020-03-18,26:42,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning and now that we have cases in all 50 States, we’re continuing to move out on the president’s call to bring the full resources of the federal government, a full partnership with every state and territory, the full power of the American economy to support businesses and families. As the president says to us and everyday, “We’ll do whatever it takes. We’re all in this together.”"
2020-03-18,27:10,Mike Pence,"Yesterday, the president met with the tourism industry executives and also had an engaging discussion with all the top companies in our industrial and medical supply chain. Now, the president, as you all are aware, also announced today that by mutual consent the Northern border to Canada will be close to non-essential travel. This does not include essential travel or the transit of goods, but it was through a mutual discussion that took place this morning between the president and Prime Minister Trudeau and the Department of Homeland Security will be effectuating that decision."
2020-03-18,27:46,Mike Pence,"The president spoke with some of the nation’s top business leaders today, again to speak about the supply chain in the country. And for our part, we’re going to be conducting a conference call later today with state and local health officials to renew our ongoing commitment of cooperation and collaboration."
2020-03-18,28:07,Mike Pence,"As the president said last week in signing the Stafford Act, he stood up the National Response Coordination Center and today at the president’s direction, FEMA has gone to Level 1. FEMA’s mission is to support disasters that are locally executed, state managed and federally supported. And tomorrow, the president will be hosting all the nation’s governors from a video conference at FEMA to ensure that they have a full connection to all of the activated regions for FEMA going forward."
2020-03-18,28:43,Mike Pence,"And with regard to testing, I’m pleased to report that we’re increasing the number of tests being performed by the thousands every day thanks to the public private partnership that President Trump forged with commercial laboratories around the country."
2020-03-18,28:58,Mike Pence,"Our health experts tell us to remind every American, it’s important to remember people without symptoms should not get tested. We want to make sure that the supply of testing is there for those that need it most or are symptomatic or in the vulnerable population."
2020-03-18,29:15,Mike Pence,"Dr Deborah Birks, in a moment, will address the progress that we’re making on testing, the infection rate, our recommendations to every America as well as some important new findings about the impact on youth that we’re gaining from data that’s coming in from Europe. That’ll be important to every, every American."
2020-03-18,29:35,Mike Pence,"On the subject of supplies, the president has our task force extremely focused as the president mentioned yesterday, mentioned that he’s invoking the Defense Production Act today. Secretary Esper, in a few moments, will describe the ongoing efforts that the Department of Defense is taking to make medical resources available."
2020-03-18,29:54,Mike Pence,"Secretary Robert Wilkie will announce decisions the VA has made to expand hospital capacity within their system. Also, with regard to medical personnel, at the president’s direction, HHS is issuing a regulation today that will allow all doctors and medical professionals to practice across state lines to meet the needs of hospitals that may arise in adjoining areas."
2020-03-18,30:18,Mike Pence,"In addition to that, we are again today, asking every American and our medical community leaders and hospitals to partner with us in delaying elective procedures across the country in our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they’re needed most. Seema Verma will describe guidance that CMS will be issuing on that front."
2020-03-18,30:44,Mike Pence,"And finally, just I want to remind every American of the president’s 15-day Guidance to slow the spread. We are grateful for members of the media and the general public that are adhering to these, sharing them with neighbors and friends. All of our experts continue to believe that if every American will do their part and embrace and put into practice these principles that we can significantly limit the reach of the coronavirus in the weeks and months ahead. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-18,31:13,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Dr. Birks, please."
2020-03-18,31:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. So you know, we continue to look at data every single day. There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs. We think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea about the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were at particular risk."
2020-03-18,31:48,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades, there may be disproportional number of infections among that group. And so, even if it’s a rare occurrence, it may be seen more frequently in that group and be evident now. So we’re looking at that information very carefully."
2020-03-18,32:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We have not seen any significant mortality in the children, but we are concerned about the early reports coming out of Italy and France."
2020-03-18,32:25,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So again, I’m going to call on that generation that’s part of that group that brought us innovation, particularly throughout all of their ability to look around corners and skip through games. I always went level by level. I didn’t realize that you could go from level three to level seven. That’s what they’ve taught us. They look for things that we don’t see. We need them to be healthy."
2020-03-18,32:49,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So again, I’m not only calling on you to adheed what’s in the guidance, but to really ensure that each and every one of you are protecting each other. And so, we cannot have these large gatherings that continue to occur throughout the country for people who are off work to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus. You have the potential then to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about and cause them to have a disastrous outcome."
2020-03-18,33:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, on the testing piece and what we’re learning. I know you know last week and bringing the private sector, I think what has been exciting to me over the last two and a half weeks is to see this administration harness the full capacity of the private sector, understanding that a lot of our solutions that we need to confront this virus rely on the private sector. Bringing the private sector commercial labs was critical into this process. We are now beginning to see that they have spread out in a prioritized way because we asked them to prioritize the regions that were mostly affected. And so, you still may have difficulty getting tests in areas that do not have significant cases. We’ve had them prioritize the regions where we need diagnosis and their diagnostic percent."
2020-03-18,34:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Remember, I told you South Korea was under 4%, so 96% of people were negative. The last report we’ve seen from the laboratories have about a seven plus percent positivity rate. Still, 93 plus percent or 92% are negative. But I think that’s encouraging to me personally that we’re prioritizing appropriately to those areas that have the greatest need."
2020-03-18,34:28,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Today and yesterday, Thermo Fisher pushed out most of their laboratory testing capacity and that will dramatically increase the app platform and the ability to run additional tests in addition to Roche."
2020-03-18,34:43,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I appreciate everybody’s attention to these numbers. I’m excited that we’ve prioritized where the need was the greatest. But again, please follow the guidance and please make sure in every report that you’re putting out that you’re talking about the presidential guidance to actually stop the spread of this virus. Thank you."
2020-03-18,35:02,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Deborah, very much. Mark, please."
2020-03-18,35:08,Mark Esper,"Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. So good afternoon, everyone. And I want to provide an update on DOD’s coronavirus efforts. As we continue to focus on our three priorities, that’s first of all, protecting our personnel and their families, second, safeguarding our national security mission capabilities and third, of course, supporting the administration’s whole of government approach."
2020-03-18,35:27,Mark Esper,"First of all though, I do want to assure the American people that the United States Military remains ready and capable of defending the country and our interests abroad. Now with that, the department is leaning forward in our response to COVID-19. We have issued international and domestic travel restrictions to all DOD personnel and families that should dramatically reduce potential exposure to the virus. Those have been in place for some time now."
2020-03-18,35:52,Mark Esper,"As I announced yesterday, the Department of Defense will make available up to 5,000,000 N95 respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from our own strategic reserves to the Department of Health and Human Services for distribution. The first one million masks will be available immediately. We are also prepared to distribute to HHS up to 2000 operational deployable ventilators for use as needed."
2020-03-18,36:15,Mark Esper,"Yesterday, I was at Fort Dietrich, Maryland, which is probably the military’s premier research institute where I got updated on the incredible work our people are doing as part of the inter agency team to work on vaccines and therapeutics. They are making great progress there."
2020-03-18,36:29,Mark Esper,We also have announced that we’ve certified our 16th lab or will soon certified our 16th lab to help with processing tests from across the country.
2020-03-18,36:40,Mark Esper,"Additionally, I have directed, as the president mentioned that, the hospital ships, Mercy and Comfort be prepared to deploy to increase the nation’s medical capacity. And we have also alerted a variety of filled and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as well as needed based on direction from the commander-in-chief."
2020-03-18,36:57,Mark Esper,"Today, leadership from the Army Corps of Engineers is in New York meeting with Governor Cuomo and his team. I spoke with Governor Cuomo yesterday and other governors. I will be speaking to more in the coming days to make sure that they know what DOD could provide through our system to address their needs."
2020-03-18,37:13,Mark Esper,"In my conversations with governors and members of Congress about DOD’s resources, I’ve made it clear that we will continue to support the administration’s comprehensive efforts and the country every step of the way while ensuring our nation’s security remains the top priority."
2020-03-18,37:28,Mark Esper,"I want to conclude by thanking again, all of our service members and their families who have been affected by this outbreak. They are all great heroes. We are continued to support them throughout this. We are all in this together. Thank you all very much."
2020-03-18,37:39,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Mark. Seema, please."
2020-03-18,37:44,Seema Verma,"Thank you. So yesterday the president made a very important announcement about telehealth, and this is allowing our 62 million seniors to be able to get some medical services from the safety of their home, reducing their risk and without any copays. But we’re also making sure that the healthcare system is repaired and that those on the front lines have the support that they need."
2020-03-18,38:04,Seema Verma,"The reality is, the stakes are high and we need to preserve personal protective equipment for those that are on the front lines of this fight. And to that end, we have put out guidelines over the last two weeks to expand the types of masks that can be used in routine care and saving those N95s for the most risky situations."
2020-03-18,38:22,Seema Verma,"Conserving personal protective equipment is also essential to combat the virus. So today, CMS will announce detailed recommendations to further promote this needed conservation, specifically by limiting non-essential elective medical and surgical procedures, including dental procedures."
2020-03-18,38:43,Seema Verma,"We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients, and hospitals prioritize what is essential while leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients. And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider these recommendations. They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the front lines. And it’ll protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus."
2020-03-18,39:16,Seema Verma,"We fully appreciate that this is going to have a major impact on the healthcare system, but the shared sacrifice is essential to help those that are on the front lines. And I want to thank the medical societies such as the American College of Surgeons and the American Dental Association that took a proactive approach and already posted these recommendations. And we’ve also talked to the American Medical Association and they have fully indicated their support for this recommendation. We now invite the entire healthcare community to join us in this effort. Thank you."
2020-03-18,39:46,Donald Trump,Thank you very much.
2020-03-18,39:48,Mike Pence,Robert.
2020-03-18,39:49,Donald Trump,"Robert, please."
2020-03-18,39:51,Robert Wilkie,"Thank you, Mr. President. My instructions from the president were very clear. I was to do everything imaginable as aggressively as possible to protect the nine and a half million veterans who are part of the Department of Veterans Affairs."
2020-03-18,40:06,Robert Wilkie,"Last month, we established 19 emergency operations centers across the country and we began to limit the number of visitors who entered our facilities. We were the first system to begin triaging across the country in our 170 hospitals, the entrance of anyone into our facility without being questioned or tested. We expanded those restrictions to those in our 135 community living centers, which have about 7,800 veterans who are in acute, in acute conditions to make sure that they were protected."
2020-03-18,40:45,Robert Wilkie,We also took the next step and made sure that we limited the dental surgeries that we provided. We’ve cut back by one third the number of routine appointments we have had and we have canceled elective surgeries. These were all part of the president’s directive to be as aggressive in a public health sense as we could be and I think we have set the pace for the entire country.
2020-03-18,41:13,Robert Wilkie,"I will say, we’ve often said that we work the most noble mission in the federal government. Our veterans have been in the toughest spots in the world. They have been put in conditions that are unimaginable to most Americans and they have responded. They have responded clearly. They have responded with passion and also, the 400,000 members of our department who are out there on the front lines."
2020-03-18,41:40,Robert Wilkie,"The last thing I will say is that, you have heard a lot about the fourth mission that VA has. Our first three missions are healthcare, benefits and memorial affairs. Our fourth mission is to support the federal government in times of natural disasters and pandemics. We are the buttress force in case that FEMA or HHS calls upon us to deploy medical professionals across the country to meet crises. We plan for that every day. We are gaming out emergency preparedness scenarios and we stand ready when the president needs us to expand our mission. Thank you."
2020-03-18,42:15,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Robert. Thank you. Thank you, all. That’s very nice. Any questions, please?"
2020-03-18,42:22,Group,Mr. President. [crosstalk 00:42:22].
2020-03-18,42:22,Donald Trump,Go.
2020-03-18,42:23,Unnamed (Reporter),"[inaudible 00:42:23] two questions, if I may. Your treasury secretary was on Capitol Hill talking about the potential for what could come and he said that unemployment could skyrocket to 20%. That could rival the Great Depression. Are we looking at potentially historic-"
2020-03-18,42:39,Donald Trump,"No. Well, I don’t agree with that."
2020-03-18,42:39,Unnamed (Reporter),… devastation?
2020-03-18,42:41,Donald Trump,"Yeah. No, I don’t agree. That’s a absolute total worst case scenario. But no, we don’t look at that at all."
2020-03-18,42:47,Unnamed (Reporter),Okay. Thank you. And my second question-
2020-03-18,42:48,Donald Trump,We’re nowhere near it.
2020-03-18,42:49,Unnamed (Reporter),"Okay. Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus? There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country. Your own aid, Secretary Azar says he does not use this term. He says, “Ethnicity does not cause the virus.” Why do you keep using this?"
2020-03-18,43:06,Donald Trump,Because it comes from China.
2020-03-18,43:06,Unnamed (Reporter),A lot of people say it’s racist.
2020-03-18,43:08,Donald Trump,"It’s not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China, that’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate."
2020-03-18,43:15,Unnamed (Reporter),Do you know the concerns about Chinese Americans in this country?
2020-03-18,43:15,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please, John."
2020-03-18,43:16,Unnamed (Reporter),"To the aids behind you, are you comfortable with this term?"
2020-03-18,43:19,Donald Trump,"I have great love for all of the people from our country. But as you know, China tried to say at one point, maybe they’ve stopped now, that it was caused by American soldiers. That can’t happen. It’s not going to happen, not as long as I’m president. It comes from China. John, please."
2020-03-18,43:39,John (Reporter),"Two question if I could, Mr. President? First of all, the Defense Procurement Act, you’re invoking it today."
2020-03-18,43:44,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-18,43:44,John (Reporter),"Senator Schumer said on the floor a short time ago, that it urgently needs to be put into action to produce medical supplies, particularly ventilators."
2020-03-18,43:53,Donald Trump,Yep.
2020-03-18,43:53,John (Reporter),Do you have some targets that you would like to see immediately spooled up under the act?
2020-03-18,43:56,Donald Trump,"We do have. We have tremendous numbers of ventilators, but there has never been an instance like this where no matter what you have, it’s not enough. That would be the case. It’s being signed. It’s essentially drawn and I’m going to sign it in just a little while. If we need to use it, we’ll be using it at full speed ahead."
2020-03-18,44:16,John (Reporter),"Right. You said, “It’s urgently needed to be used.” Do you have some targets?"
2020-03-18,44:19,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to know whether or not urgent, but we will… Yeah, we do have targets. We have targets for certain pieces of equipment. We have targets for masks, you know, the masks, the numbers of masks are incredible. We’ve ordered millions of them, but we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested. We’ve never had to even think in terms of these numbers, but we need millions of masks and all of that will be ordered. We need respirators. We need, ventilators is a big thing because it’s a complex piece of equipment. So we have a lot of ventilators, but we’re going to be ordering more."
2020-03-18,44:51,John (Reporter),"And second question, what size will the checks be that will be sent out to Americans?"
2020-03-18,44:55,Donald Trump,"To be determined. We’re working with the Senate right now. We’re working with everybody on Capitol Hill. There has been tremendous… There really has been. I mean, with some exceptions obviously because it’s always the way it is. They have been getting along very well, Republicans and Democrats. It’s a nice thing, very bipartisan, and so forth."
2020-03-18,45:13,John (Reporter),Would you like to see them more than a thousand dollars?
2020-03-18,45:15,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to see. I don’t want to get into that right now, John. We are looking at different numbers. We’re looking at timing. That would be different, splitting the time, splitting the payments. We’re looking at a lot of different things. It hasn’t been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined and people want to go big as opposed… Everybody seems to want to go big and they want to get to the recovery. The big thing we can do is get rid of this horrible, I call it the unseen, the unseen enemy, you call it. There is a thousand different terms for it. It snuck up on us. It did 128 countries, I think. It’s in something like that, very close to that. Think of that, so it spreads violently. It’s a very contagious, very, very contagious virus."
2020-03-18,46:01,John (Reporter),Do you consider America to be on a wartime footing in terms of fighting this virus?
2020-03-18,46:04,Donald Trump,"I do. I actually do. I’m looking at it that way because, you know, if it got out of control. The big thing we did was a very early stoppage of people coming in who could be very, very heavily infected. It was a very good move and it was very early, very, very early when most people, including a lot of professionals, they didn’t want us to do it. That really saved a lot of lives. And yeah, I look at it. I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that’s what we’re fighting. It’s a very tough situation. You have to do things. You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they’ve ever been. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. And then one day, you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. But, we’re doing it and we’re doing it well. And I’ll tell you, the American people have been incredible, for the most part, they’ve been really incredible. Yeah, please, [Kaitlin 00:20:57]."
2020-03-18,46:58,Kaitlin,I have a question for you and then I have one for Secretary Wilkie as well.
2020-03-18,47:00,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-03-18,47:00,Kaitlin,"But I’ll start with you. You just said there are a tremendous number of ventilators that we have, but for weeks hospitals have been warning about a critical shortage that they say we are not prepared for. So why did it take so long to invoke the Defense Production Act?"
2020-03-18,47:13,Donald Trump,"Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators too. And when we have thousands of ventilators, it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing. Normally, we wouldn’t be doing testing and they decided to do it, very, very hard to ramp up. Now, we’re getting highly sophisticated tests and it’s going very well. But, nobody has ever heard of testing in the kind of quantities that you’re talking about."
2020-03-18,47:40,Kaitlin,"But we knew for weeks we needed more ventilators, so why did it take so long?"
2020-03-18,47:42,Donald Trump,"Well, we knew. It depends. It depends on how it goes. Worst case, absolutely, a best case, not at all, so we’re going to have to see where it goes. But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators and they’re complex. You know, these are complex machines. But, we’re ordering them. Does anybody have a, Mike maybe you do, how many do we have?"
2020-03-18,48:04,Kaitlin,"Yeah, you said you’d get back to us with those numbers."
2020-03-18,48:07,Donald Trump,"Please. Yeah, please. Do you know the number?"
2020-03-18,48:08,Kaitlin,The exact number?
2020-03-18,48:09,Mike Pence,"We have a specific number of ventilators in the stockpile. It’s in excess of 10,000 and you just heard the announcement from the Department of Defense. They’ll be adding several more thousand to that. But the president, even this morning and yesterday afternoon, speaking with the largest companies in the supply chain in this country, we’re hearing a tremendous spirit among industry leaders who are ready to step in and add to that volume. The stockpiles don’t count all of the ventilators that exist today in the marketplace and in healthcare facilities around the country."
2020-03-18,48:43,Mike Pence,"But, the president has given us a directive to make sure that our stockpile, but just as importantly working with industry leaders that we’re securing the increase in ventilators, the increase in masks, gloves, eye protective care, garments that are all necessary to lean forward and [crosstalk 00:49:02] we’re confident we’ll be able to accomplish that with the incredible cooperation of the supply chain that exists in America today."
2020-03-18,49:14,Kaitlin,"But, we don’t have an exact number for nationwide. How many ventilators do we have?"
2020-03-18,49:14,Donald Trump,We can give you that exact number. We’ll give it to you.
2020-03-18,49:14,Kaitlin,Okay. [inaudible 00:49:13].
2020-03-18,49:14,Donald Trump,But we’re ordering a lot more.
2020-03-18,49:15,Kaitlin,"Okay, sir. That’s [crosstalk 00:49:15]."
2020-03-18,49:15,Donald Trump,"Yeah, go ahead in the back, yes."
2020-03-18,49:20,Kaitlin,I have a question for the VA secretary.
2020-03-18,49:20,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, two question."
2020-03-18,49:20,Kaitlin,I have one question for [crosstalk 00:49:19].
2020-03-18,49:20,Donald Trump,"Yeah, one second. One second, Kaitlin. We’ll do it in a second."
2020-03-18,49:22,Kaitlin,Okay.
2020-03-18,49:23,Donald Trump,You’ll be able to do it.
2020-03-18,49:23,Kaitlin,"Okay, it’s important."
2020-03-18,49:23,Unnamed (Reporter),"Two questions, Mr. President. Thank you."
2020-03-18,49:25,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-18,49:25,Unnamed (Reporter),"The first one on the Canadian border, what was the tipping point? Friday, we talked about it. Then Monday you said, no one knew. We’re not considering closing the border."
2020-03-18,49:32,Donald Trump,"No, I said not yet. I spoke with the prime minister, Trudeau, a very good relationship obviously between us and our two countries and no tipping point. It’s just that we want to isolate from the standpoint we don’t want people coming into contact because that’s the way we’re going to win this war. That is so important and we both thought it was time."
2020-03-18,49:53,Donald Trump,"Now it’s not affecting trade. It’s non-essential. It’s non-essential crossings. It won’t affect trade at all. And it was just something we thought would be good for both countries. Yes, please. [crosstalk 00:24:04]."
2020-03-18,50:06,Unnamed (Reporter),"The second question, Mr. President. How can you be sure that trade-"
2020-03-18,50:08,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-03-18,50:09,Unnamed (Reporter),"… is not going to be a factor of the virus? How can you be sure that trade and everything that’s being shipped from one side, [crosstalk 00:50:14]?"
2020-03-18,50:15,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re doing it in a very careful manner. You can only be vigilant and very professional. It’s not pertaining at this moment to trade between the two countries."
2020-03-18,50:26,Unnamed (Reporter),"Thank you, sir."
2020-03-18,50:27,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-03-18,50:27,Unnamed (Reporter),"We are hearing that the trillion dollar economic stimulus package could look something like $50 billion for the airlines, $150 billion dollars in loan guarantees for critical sectors in the economy, a $250 billion dollar payment on April 6th directly to individuals, another $250 billion dollar payment on May 18th, again, directly to individuals and as well $300 billion dollars for small business loan guarantees. Is that, in the general sense, of what you’re looking at?"
2020-03-18,50:53,Donald Trump,"It could be. It could be. And we’re also playing with a lot of numbers, a lot of very big numbers and a lot of very small numbers, frankly. We want to take care, we have to help everybody. It was nobody’s fault this happened. I mean, some people could say it was somebody’s fault actually, but it was nobody’s fault. And certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers in planes and had no passengers on cruise ships and all of the things that have happened. But I will say that, they can’t be blamed for this. And we want to keep those companies vibrant because it’s, there is going to be a comeback very, very quickly as soon as this is solved. And it will be solved. We will win. And there will be a comeback and it’ll take place very quickly."
2020-03-18,51:36,Unnamed (Reporter),"[inaudible 00:51:36] $50 billion dollars. There is, give or take, 330 million Americans or, so if you just do the math on that, that’s about $750 a person, a family of four, that would be about $3,000 on average, again, rough, rough map, which is that where this is headed? It’s actually thousands of dollars."
2020-03-18,51:52,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t want to say that because it’s a moving… Every number that you mentioned, yes, we’ve talked about those numbers. We’re also moving those numbers in both directions, so we’ll let you know. It’s moving along fast."
2020-03-18,52:03,Donald Trump,"What directions, so we’ll let you know. It’s moving along fast. Again, there’s a great bipartisan effort going on that I haven’t really seen before to this extent."
2020-03-18,52:14,Unnamed,"On the [inaudible 00:52:14] swab that you mentioned at the beginning of this, has the FDA approved that test?"
2020-03-18,52:18,Donald Trump,"No. They’re looking at it. It’s down the line, and they’re looking at it very seriously. And I think it would be a great thing, because the others, to use a nice word, it’s very inconvenient. It’s very tough."
2020-03-18,52:28,Unnamed,"I’ve got a question for you, sir. You tweeted this morning about your approval rating amongst Republicans. You have said that you give yourself a 10 in terms of handling this crisis. How do you reassure Americans at home who don’t trust you to handle a crisis of this magnitude?"
2020-03-18,52:42,Donald Trump,"Well, I think we’re doing a really good job. We started off with a termination of the border, the people coming in from China where this all started. That meant I took it very seriously. And when I use the word calm, calm doesn’t mean that I’m not taking it seriously, and we should be calm. We should be extremely calm. But yeah, 95% within the Republican party and over 50%, and, also, we have very great approval numbers. People like the job that we’re doing. And when you compare this to other epidemics, or if you want to use a different term, you can, but within this country, and you look at what’s happened over the years, this is being handled very, very professionally."
2020-03-18,53:24,Donald Trump,"We have the greatest professionals in the world. We’re doing a good job. Nobody’s ever been swamped like this, and nothing’s been so contagious. The level of contagion has been incredible, actually. Nobody’s seen anything quite like this."
2020-03-18,53:37,Donald Trump,"Yeah, Peter, go ahead."
2020-03-18,53:38,Peter (Reporter),"If I can ask you about the tests, sir, for a second. If federal officials have shipped millions of tests as you and your colleagues have said, why is the federal government says only 59,000 tests been processed to this point. We just heard from the Atlanta public health director saying that they have fewer than 50 test kits for more than 900,000 citizens. Where are the tests?"
2020-03-18,54:01,Donald Trump,I’ll let Mike answer that.
2020-03-18,54:04,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So that’s a very critical question, and thank you for asking it. So the test kits that we put out last week through the rapid movement of that meeting that president Trump called less than two weeks ago, that has resulted in bringing our private sector to the table, because the tests and the platform that was out there could only run between four and 12 tests per platform per day. We’ve now moved into platforms that can run basically tens of thousands of tests per day. So yeah, the reason I’m grateful for your question, because it allows me to point out that a course then there was backlog. There were individuals who had been tested who hadn’t had their specimen run because of the slow throughput. It’s now in a high speed platform. So we will see the number of people diagnosed dramatically increase the next four to five days."
2020-03-18,55:01,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I know some of you will use that to raise an alarm that we are worse than Italy because of our slope of our curve. To every American out there, it will be five to six days worth of tests being run in 24 to 48 hours. So our curves will not be stable until sometime next week. The reason I talked about Thermofisher yesterday is because their platform is in 2, 000 laboratories. They’re the ones that are putting out the million tests this week that will solve the issue that Atlanta and others have brought up. I wanted to be clear, we prioritize the areas. We do County by County analysis based on those analyses, on what counties had more than 50 cases, we prioritize the test kits we put out, the 400,000. And that’s why we’re seeing a 7% plus positivity rate. We’ll be able to expand that platform and reprioritize based on the accessibility of the other kits."
2020-03-18,56:06,Peter (Reporter),"Mr. President, perhaps I can follow up. How are non-symptomatic professional athletes getting tests while others are waiting in line and can’t get them? Do the well connected go to the front of the line?"
2020-03-18,56:16,Donald Trump,"You’d have to ask them that question. No, I wouldn’t say so, but perhaps that’s been the story of life. That does happen on occasion, and I’ve noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly. Look, we inherited a very-"
2020-03-18,56:31,Peter (Reporter),Would you encourage them to defer a test to other?
2020-03-18,56:34,Donald Trump,"Excuse me, excuse me. We inherited a very obsolete system. This was a system that was out of date, obsolete, or it was a system that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity, the number of people that we’re talking about. Millions and millions of people. If you go back in years past, like even recently with the flu, nobody had tests before. They didn’t test the entire nation to see whether or not they had flu. They got the flu, they got better. Hopefully they got better. That was it. Now all of a sudden, they do this very complex testing."
2020-03-18,57:05,Donald Trump,"What we’ve done is we broke it down. We broken up the system, but it was obsolete and/or you could say it was also a system that just wasn’t meant to handle the kind of volume that you’re talking about. We’ve rebuilt it into a system that, for the future, will be a very good system if you want to go this route. But this was never done before, and I would imagine it will be done in the future, but we built it into a very good system by using private companies, the great private companies. And I have to say Roche has been doing a very good job. They’re doing a lot of work, a very good job."
2020-03-18,57:36,Donald Trump,But this was an obsolete system. This was not a system that was meant to do anything like this or even near this.
2020-03-18,57:42,Donald Trump,John?
2020-03-18,57:43,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, a couple things. A major train coalition is calling on you to suspend tariffs with other countries as part of the response to the coronavirus."
2020-03-18,57:53,Donald Trump,"Who heads that group? Those countries do, probably. Go check."
2020-03-18,57:57,John (Reporter),It’s an American free trade.
2020-03-18,57:58,Donald Trump,"I know, I’m sure of free trade… Look, China’s paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there’s no reason to do that. They haven’t even spoken to me about that. China hasn’t asked me to do that, but we’re getting billions of dollars a year from tariffs from China, and I can’t imagine Americans asking for that. But it could be that China will ask for a suspension or something. We’ll see what happens. China’s having a very rough time. They have their worst year in 76 years as I understand it. They’re having a very, very tough time. And then on top of it, this happened with the virus."
2020-03-18,58:31,Donald Trump,"But no, we’re taking in billions of dollars a year in tariffs. And this was caused by something totally unrelated to tariffs."
2020-03-18,58:39,John (Reporter),"On asylum seekers and people who crossed the Southern border illegally, are you planning to invoke 42 U.S.C. 265, which would allow you to prohibit entry of certain people?"
2020-03-18,58:51,Donald Trump,The answer is yes.
2020-03-18,58:53,John (Reporter),When will that happen?
2020-03-18,58:53,Donald Trump,"Very soon. Probably today, yes."
2020-03-18,58:57,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:58:57] question for Dr. Birx. On the border, firstly, are there plans to fully shut the Mexican border, and what do you define as essential travel when it comes to the U.S. Canadian border?"
2020-03-18,59:06,Donald Trump,"Well, I think essential is medical. We have military working together. We have industry working together. And again, it’s not affecting trade. So things like that, but just leisurely, let’s go to a restaurant and have dinner, which a lot of people do. They come both ways. They go in both directions, that kind of thing, we have ended on a temporary basis. Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-03-18,59:28,Unnamed,Are you planning to close the Southern border?
2020-03-18,59:29,Donald Trump,"Not close it. No, we’re not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do."
2020-03-18,59:38,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-18,59:38,Unnamed,May I ask her questions if I could?
2020-03-18,59:40,Donald Trump,"Yeah, go ahead. You know what? Go ahead. Sure."
2020-03-18,59:41,Donald Trump,Doctor.
2020-03-18,59:43,Unnamed,"So trying to clarify something, because just a week ago, you all were standing here telling us that unless you had sustained contact with somebody who is symptomatic for COVID 19, you really didn’t need to worry. You told the president, the vice president, that if they shook hands with somebody who had this, if they took a photograph with somebody who had this, he didn’t really need to worry, and yet, several days later, we’re in a situation where people are being told, “Don’t leave your houses.” There are curfew saying, “You can not walk alone at night after a certain time.” Can you walk us through what seems like a very dramatic swing, a very dramatic disconnect from what we were hearing before to what we’re hearing now."
2020-03-18,01:00:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So two things. We look at data all the time, and I know you’re looking at the China and South Korea data. And when you look at China and South Korea data and you look what China and South Korea did, you could see that their curves are not only blunted outside of Wuhan, so the Chinese areas outside of Wuhan blunted curve and South Korea blunted curve. If you look at their curve today, they’re already on the far end of their epidemic curve. Of course, none of those countries are fully back to work. And so that’s what we worry about, too."
2020-03-18,01:00:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Secondly, there was a series of scientific articles published, and I know you’ve seen them, too, about surface contamination. I think none of us really understood the level of surface piece. So we’re still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface. And this is why those fundamental guidelines were put out that that says, “Don’t expose yourself to surfaces outside the home.”"
2020-03-18,01:01:18,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Basically, what those guidelines are is don’t expose yourself to excess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected and then the person to person contact, and don’t expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it, for which on hard surfaces, I know we had the cardboard issue about shipping, hard surfaces, not shown in fabric as much or in cardboard, but hard surface transmission. These are issues that we haven’t had to deal with before with the level of respiratory infections, and that’s why we have this concern, and that’s why the president put out the guidelines. And so it’s to cover both of those pieces. That’s all new science, all new models. I think many of you have the imperial study available and looked at the impact of those. That’s the first time those have been modeled as a comprehensive approach to mitigating an epidemic."
2020-03-18,01:02:10,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-03-18,01:02:14,Jennifer,"Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the administration would look into executive order that would expand the use of investigational drugs against the virus, but the FDA scientists are warning that this could put patients at risk. It’s something you’re looking at?"
2020-03-18,01:02:29,Donald Trump,"No, I haven’t seen the article. We are making a lot of progress therapeutically. I will say that, but I have not seen that article, no."
2020-03-18,01:02:36,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-03-18,01:02:39,Unnamed,"Mr. President, we’ve shut down non essential travel to Canada. Are you considering shutting down all travel to brunt the spread of the virus, and we’ve heard from industries like the airlines who are seeking relief. What other industries, or how exactly is your administration going to determine which industries and businesses get the help they need?"
2020-03-18,01:03:02,Donald Trump,"There were certain industries that people know. The airlines would be number one if you look at what’s going on. They go from having the best year they’ve ever had to having no passengers because of what we’ve had to do in order to win this war. It’s a war, and so basically, you know what many of the industries are. What we want to do is we want to make sure they all stay together so that after the war is won, we can immediately go right back up to where we were and even beyond. I think we’re going to go beyond where we were, and a lot of people are saying that by the way. We’re poised to do that, but we have to win the war first."
2020-03-18,01:03:34,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-03-18,01:03:35,Unnamed,"Thank you. To follow up on that, treasury proposed $150 billion dollars today for those industries, but their proposal doesn’t detail which industries would get that money and how much. So aside from the airlines, which you just mentioned, what about the cruise industry, the hotels? How much of that money do you see them each year?"
2020-03-18,01:03:52,Donald Trump,"We’re talking about all of it. Haven’t detailed it yet. We have detailed it to senators and to members of the House. We have been talking about it, and we’re coming up with numbers. Haven’t gotten there yet, but certainly hotel industry, the cruise ship industry, the airlines. Those are all prime candidates. Absolutely."
2020-03-18,01:04:11,Unnamed,"On the Northern border, sir-"
2020-03-18,01:04:13,Donald Trump,Which border?
2020-03-18,01:04:14,Unnamed,"The Northern border. When you say temporary, which is what you said in your tweet, does that mean it’s 30 days?"
2020-03-18,01:04:20,Donald Trump,"I would say 30 days, and hopefully at the end of 30 days, we’ll be in great shape."
2020-03-18,01:04:25,Donald Trump,"Jeff, please."
2020-03-18,01:04:27,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, I was struck by what Dr. Birx said about millennials and others perhaps not taking some of these warnings as seriously as you would like. Some of those people also seem to be your supporters and conservatives who may be quoting some of what you said at the beginning of this, comparing it to the flu. What is your message to them to really follow what you’ve been saying so far, and are you concerned that they’re still listening maybe to some of your earlier comments rather than your more recent ones?"
2020-03-18,01:04:54,Donald Trump,"Well, I think my earlier comments are to be calm. I do want people to be calm, because we’re going to win this. And we’re going to win it, it’s just a question of time ,and I want it to go quickly. So based on the fact that I want it to go quickly, I hope they just listened to what we’ve been saying over the last period of time. We don’t want them gathering. And I see they do gather, including on beaches and including in restaurants, young people. They don’t realize. They are feeling invincible. I don’t know if you felt invincible when you were very young, but they were feeling totally invincible, or are feeling that way, but they don’t realize that they can be carrying lots of bad things home to grandmother and grandfather and even their parents. So we want them to heed the advice. We made the advice, and I think it’s getting through. I do believe it’s getting through."
2020-03-18,01:05:39,Donald Trump,"Jim, please."
2020-03-18,01:05:39,Peter (Reporter),And what do you say to them if they’re watching?
2020-03-18,01:05:41,Donald Trump,If they’re what?
2020-03-18,01:05:43,Peter (Reporter),"I think there are a lot of them watching. A lot of these people at home, these young people."
2020-03-18,01:05:45,Donald Trump,Well I think I just said it.
2020-03-18,01:05:46,Peter (Reporter),I was going to say what do you say to them?
2020-03-18,01:05:48,Donald Trump,"Heed the advice. I just said. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Peter."
2020-03-18,01:05:59,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. In talking about China, you’ve been very clear about who you think is to blame or where the origin to blame for this virus is."
2020-03-18,01:06:06,Donald Trump,"Not think. No, no, I don’t think, I know where it came from. I don’t know if you’d say China’s to blame. Certainly, we didn’t get an early run on it. It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier, but it comes from China, and it’s not a question about that. Nobody’s questioning that."
2020-03-18,01:06:22,Unnamed,"So Senator Cotton is saying that they should be punished, in so many words, for inflicting this on the American people. Do you feel that way about it?"
2020-03-18,01:06:32,Donald Trump,"Well, I have a lot of respect for Tom Cotton, and I know exactly what he’s been saying. And there are those people that say that. So we’ll see what happens. Thank you."
2020-03-18,01:06:41,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:14:41].
2020-03-18,01:06:41,Donald Trump,It’s your turn. Go ahead.
2020-03-18,01:06:43,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:14:45].
2020-03-18,01:06:43,Donald Trump,"Please. He’s been waiting a long time, please. You’ve had your hand up so nicely for a long. It’s your time."
2020-03-18,01:06:51,Unnamed,"Thank you sir. We’ve seen the Chinese government kick out reporters from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post. What is your message to the Chinese when it comes to transparency at a moment when you still have reporters asking you questions here at the White House?"
2020-03-18,01:07:05,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I’m not happy to see it. I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well, but I don’t like seeing that at all. I’m not happy about that at all."
2020-03-18,01:07:19,Donald Trump,"Yes, please."
2020-03-18,01:07:19,Unnamed,I wonder if you agree with it. Do you believe that China is inflicting this upon our country?
2020-03-18,01:07:25,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t believe they’re inflicting. I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice, absolutely. Please."
2020-03-18,01:07:33,Unnamed,"Yeah, Mr. President, your credibility ratings are very low. There was a recent NPR poll-"
2020-03-18,01:07:39,Donald Trump,"Who are you asking of that question, because I see that they’re very high. If you look, I’m 95% of the Republican party. We just had a poll that was done by a very reputable group. We’re beating sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida, the state of Florida, and in other states. So I don’t really know who you’re talking about."
2020-03-18,01:08:02,Donald Trump,"Jennifer, go ahead, please. Please."
2020-03-18,01:08:03,Jennifer,I have two questions if you’re willing to. Would you give us an update on your conversation with the airline executives? Did you explain to them what’s coming? What was their reaction?
2020-03-18,01:08:12,Donald Trump,"I did, and they explained to me where they’re coming from. They went from, as I said, full planes packed, the best year they’ve ever had by far to, boom, one day empty because of what we have to do to win this war, or we would have a level of death like people haven’t seen before. So they’ve been fantastic. They’ve been great, but they went from being extremely happy to being people that are running companies that are going to need some help, and we’ll help them, Jennifer."
2020-03-18,01:08:45,Jennifer,"On SBA laws, would you be willing to give us an update on how that’s going? We’ve been getting some reports that counties have been having difficulty getting [crosstalk 01:08:54]."
2020-03-18,01:08:53,Donald Trump,"It’s going. There’s a lot of influx to those loans, as you could imagine. A lot of people are looking at it, but we’re going to be increasing funding a lot, and they’re very well prepared to do what they have to do. And the SBA is doing a fantastic job. She is doing a really good job, the administrator."
2020-03-18,01:09:08,Donald Trump,John?
2020-03-18,01:09:10,John (Reporter),"Questions for Dr. Birx, if I could? Dr. Birx, French researchers have had some luck with hydroxychloroquine in shortening the duration of disease. Is that something that might be in the arsenal therapeutics here in the United States?"
2020-03-18,01:09:25,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think we are exploring every one of those issues. The president asked for a critical briefing on that today. He opened with that. It is more than that single drug. There are other drugs that individuals are looking at. Just to go back to what we talked about many times, there is things that look really good in cell culture against the virus that may look good in small animals, and then don’t have an impact in humans. And so those are the pieces that we’re looking at very carefully. Of course, there’s always anecdotal reports, and we’re trying to figure out how many anecdotals reports equal real scientific breakthroughs."
2020-03-18,01:10:03,John (Reporter),"Second question, are you confident of the seasonality of Coronavirus?"
2020-03-18,01:10:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"All we can do is look at the past to inform the future. We know what SARS looked like. We also know, and I just want to put this out, I know you can get it online, look at the curve in China and look at the curve in South Korea. Those curves were accomplished in still the winter season. And so we’re trying to understand what those relationships are. We’re very interested in the curves in Italy because of their different approach and we’re following every single country’s curves. And so all we can do is look at prior Coronavirus and prior respiratory infection, RNA viruses. These are RNA viruses. When you look at flu in the Northern hemisphere, when you look at parainfluenza and some of the other cold viruses, and if you look at SARS, that’s the way the peak normally occurs, but that is a November to April. We all started later. And so you’re asking me to predict based on a later start, and that’s what we’re trying to really look at china and South Korea to really inform that."
2020-03-18,01:11:19,Donald Trump,"[Katelyn 00:01:11:22], go ahead."
2020-03-18,01:11:20,Katelyn,"A question for Secretary Wilkie, if you don’t mind, or you can answer if you’d like. How many veterans of those that you need to be tested have been tested?"
2020-03-18,01:11:27,Robert Wilkie,"Those that have needed to be tested, we believe we’ve caught most of them. Right now, we have 44 veterans who have tested positive. Sadly, one has passed in Portland. We are working with state labs and private companies to make sure that testing is available. Because the president had us out aggressively early, we have been in a better place than most healthcare systems in the country. I cannot predict this. Dr. Birx said when the next surge will be, if it will be, but one of the things that we do at VA is that we prepare for national emergencies, be the national disasters or epidemics. We started preparing for this. We started stockpiling equipment. Our equipment is stable, and I think that’s in large part because of the instructions the president gave me."
2020-03-18,01:12:23,Katelyn,But do you have a number of how many have been tested out of the number that you said we tested?
2020-03-18,01:12:27,Robert Wilkie,We tested several hundred. I can’t give you the direct-
2020-03-18,01:12:29,Katelyn,It was 200 the other day. Is it higher than that?
2020-03-18,01:12:30,Robert Wilkie,We’ve tested several hundred. Yes. We’ve tested several hundred. I don’t know exactly. I do know that 44 veterans have the virus. Most of those are quarantined at home.
2020-03-18,01:12:45,Donald Trump,"Go ahead in the back, please."
2020-03-18,01:12:45,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. The question for Dr. Birx, quickly. I’m trying to understand what we… It’s about the mortality rate. Yesterday, we underlined the fact that we had reached a hundred deaths, and this morning we wake up and we’re at 110. Within 12 hours, we climbed by 10%. is it something we have to expect from now on, a 10% increase every 12 hours?"
2020-03-18,01:13:12,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So very early on in each one of these cases, if you look at all of the countries to date, the mortality is higher at the beginning because you’re diagnosing the sickest, the ones who came in quite ill. And I just want to remind the American public that the risk for serious illness in the majority of Americans are low, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t transmit it to one of those higher risk groups. And that’s why we’re asking for all Americans to take responsibility. You’re seeing mortality or deaths today from infections that occurred two to three weeks ago in general. The other thing that you’re seeing is the dramatic and very difficult impact of this virus in nursing homes. And that’s why very early on, the president and vice president had us come out, and CMS put those very strict rules in place, and everybody thought we were being too strict in keeping loved ones away from their family in nursing homes. If we’re going to solve this with a lower death rate, we have to protect the elderly because of their percent is much higher in mortality than any other age group."
2020-03-18,01:14:25,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-03-18,01:14:26,Unnamed,"Mr. President, there’s reporting that the federal government has a plan that shows that this Coronavirus outbreak might last as long as 18 months. Are you seeing those numbers? Could this actually last-"
2020-03-18,01:14:37,Donald Trump,"No, we’re not seeing that at all."
2020-03-18,01:14:39,Unnamed,"And then my second question is there are some, at least one, White House official who used the term Kung flu, referring to the fact that this virus started in China. Is that acceptable? Is it wrong? Are you worried that having this virus be talked about as a Chinese virus, that that might-"
2020-03-18,01:14:54,Donald Trump,I wonder who said that. You know who said that?
2020-03-18,01:14:57,Unnamed,"I’m not sure the person’s name, but would you condemn the fact, the Kung flu?"
2020-03-18,01:15:00,Donald Trump,Say the term again.
2020-03-18,01:15:02,Unnamed,"A person at the White House used the term Kung flu. My question is do you think that’s wrong, Kung flu? And do you think using the term Chinese virus, that puts Asian-Americans at risk, that people might target them?"
2020-03-18,01:15:15,Donald Trump,"No. No, no. I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree."
2020-03-18,01:15:22,Donald Trump,"How about last question, please? Please, go ahead."
2020-03-18,01:15:26,Unnamed,"Switching gears to a larger question here. We’ve seen that before the pandemic, there were a lot of Americans that were already alienated. We saw deaths of despair increasing through suicide and other things. Now, as these individuals, a lot of times they’re in rural parts of the country, are self isolating. What is your message to those individuals and what do you hope the individuals, communities and churches will do to reach out to them?"
2020-03-18,01:15:48,Donald Trump,"My message is to all Americans, but to those Americans who are going through a lot, we love them. We’re with them and we will not let them down. Thank you all very much."
2020-03-18,01:16:03,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, do you agree with the term Chinese virus?"
2020-03-18,01:16:10,Unnamed,"Dr. Birx, do you believe this is a Chinese virus? Is that okay to say?"
2020-03-19,01:51,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. I think this is going to be a very important conference and I’ll get to that toward the middle, but I have a few things to report and a want to thank you all for being here and I have to say I think with social distancing that the media has been much nicer. I don’t know what it is. All these empty, these in-between chairs … You probably shouldn’t have anybody sitting behind you either. You should probably go back, but I love it. It’s so much nicer, but I shouldn’t say that because you’ll get me now. Thank you all for being here, and we continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus. Before I begin, I want to start by announcing that today we are bringing home another American citizen. It was a big thing, very big. Amer Fakhoury is on his way back to the United States after being imprisoned in Lebanon since September of 2019. He’s battling late stage cancer."
2020-03-19,02:58,Donald Trump,"Mr. Fakhoury will now be able to receive the much needed care and treatment in the United States. We’ve been working very hard to get him freed, and he’s finally able to have his entire family at his side, so I’m very grateful to the Lebanese government. They worked with us and we are very proud of his family. They stood by him so strongly and they are thrilled. The United States has no higher priority than the safety and wellbeing of our citizens. We’ve gotten a tremendous number of hostages out, as you know. I think we’re 42 and O, and Robert O’Brien, as you know, was our chief negotiator for a large part of it. In fact, did so well that now we have him in a different position. So I want to thank and congratulate Robert and his team and I want to let everyone know that recovering Americans held captive and imprisoned abroad continues to be a top priority for my administration. We have one young gentlemen, Austin Tice, and we’re working very hard with Syria to get him out. We hope the Syrian government will do that, and we are counting on them to do that. We’ve written a letter just recently that he’s been there for a long time and was captured long ago. Austin Tice, his mother’s probably watching, and she’s a great lady and we’re doing the best we can. So Syria, please work with us and we would appreciate you letting him out. If you think about what we’ve done, we’ve gotten rid of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. We’ve done a lot for Syria. We have to see if they’re going to do this. So it would be very much appreciated if they would let Austin Tice out immediately. As you know, my administration is working every day to protect American people and the American economy from the virus. Yesterday I signed into law a critical support for American workers, families and small businesses."
2020-03-19,05:11,Donald Trump,"It’s a big thing. We’re providing sick leave and family medical leave to those affected by the virus, and more help is on the way as we speak. Our entire team headed by Secretary Mnuchin is on the Hill. We’re working with Democrats and Republicans and there’s a lot of good will going on. This was something that happened that was … Some people would say an act of God. I don’t view it as an act of God. I would view it as something that just surprised the whole world. And if people would’ve known about it could have been stopped in place. It could have been stopped where it came from, China. If we would have known about it, if they would have known about it, but now the whole world almost is inflicted with this horrible … With this horrible virus, and it’s too bad … It’s too bad because we never had an economy as good as the economy we had just a few weeks ago, but we’ll be back and I actually think we’ll be back stronger than ever before, because we learned a lot during this period of time."
2020-03-19,06:27,Donald Trump,"I also just invoked the Defense Production Act to help facilitate distribution of essential supplies if necessary. We’re working with Congress to provide major additional relief to the workers, small businesses, and the hardest hit industries. We want to make sure that everybody is able to continue on so that when we recover all of these companies and these great businesses, both very, very small and very, very large, they’re not going to be broken up and you’d have to put them back together. That would take a long time because we really believe in … I believe in the V curve. I believe it’s going to go … When this is defeated, this hidden scourge is defeated, I think we’re going to go up very rapidly our economy and get back to where it was and beyond. Today, I want to share with you exciting progress that the FDA is making with the private sector as we slash red tape like nobody has ever done it before."
2020-03-19,07:24,Donald Trump,"Somebody was on yesterday, on one of the networks and said that there’s never been a president at even close that’s been able to do what I’ve done in slashing all of the red tape and everything to get very important things to the market medical. So we slashed red tape to develop vaccines and therapies as fast as it can possibly be done, long before anybody else was even thinking about doing this. And as you know, earlier this week we began the first clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for the virus, and that was launched in record time. It was just a few weeks, and that would have taken years to do not so long ago. As we race to develop a vaccine, we’re also pursuing antiviral therapies and that’s what really we’re going to be talking to you about today. That’s the purpose of being up here today, and to me that’s even more important."
2020-03-19,08:22,Donald Trump,"Vaccine by its nature, you have to have long tests because you have to make sure what goes into somebody’s body is not going to do destruction, do bad things. So you need long tests, and they’re doing great with the vaccines, but it’s still a long process. But the therapies and something we can move on much faster potentially. And the treatments that will be able to reduce the severity or duration of the symptoms and make people better. Essentially we’re looking at things to make people better or at the very earliest stages, they wouldn’t even know they had it. And that’s where I believe it’s going to work even the best. The FDA commissioner, Steven Hahn, who’s with us, he’s fantastic, and he has been working 24 hours a day. He’s been … He’s worked probably as hard or harder than anybody in the group, other than maybe Mike Pence or me."
2020-03-19,09:29,Donald Trump,"What the FDA is doing is incredible. They’ve done things in times that were not even thinkable. And I’ve directed the FDA to eliminate outdated rules and bureaucracy so this work can proceed rapidly, quickly, and I mean fast. And we have to remove every barrier. There were a lot of barriers that were unnecessary, and they’ve done that to get the rapid deployment of safe, effective treatments, and we think we have some good answers. We’ll find out very, very soon. Clinical trials are already underway for many new therapies and we’re working on scaling these to allow many more Americans to access different drugs that have shown really good promise. We’ve had some really good promise. We will do so in a way that lets us continue to collect good data, to know which medicines are safe, and which medicines are working the best. We have a couple that we’re in really good shape on, and that’s for immediate delivery, immediate. Like as fast as we can get it."
2020-03-19,10:52,Donald Trump,"The FDA has also approved compassionate use for a significant number of patients. You know what that means. We’re also reviewing drugs that are approved abroad or drugs approved here for other uses. And one of the things that I’m most proud of that I got was right to try. That’s where somebody who’s ill, somebody who’s very sick, terminally ill, usually. In past administrations, we signed this a year and a half ago, you wouldn’t be able to even think about getting any of the drugs that may be showing great promise now. And they’ve been trying for many decades to get this approved. And it sounds simple, but it’s not because there’s liability involved and lots of other things. And I was able to get it approved, working with Congress, right to try. This is beyond right to try. What we’re talking about today is beyond right to try. Right to try has been, by the way, a tremendous success."
2020-03-19,11:49,Donald Trump,"People are living now that had no chance of living where we take treatments that would … Things that would have to go through years of a process. And if somebody was terminally ill and I would say, “Why wouldn’t they be able to try this?” They’d go to Asia, they’d go to Europe, they’d go all over the world to try and find something. Or some people, if they had no money, would go home to die. They’d go home to die. They had no hope. Right to try has been an incredible success, but this is beyond right to try. If treatments known to be safe in Europe, Japan or other nations are effective against a virus, we’ll use that information to protect the health and safety of American people. Nothing will stand in our way as we pursue any Avenue to find what best works against this horrible virus. Now, a drug called chloroquine, and some people would add to it, hydroxy, hydroxychloroquine, so chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine."
2020-03-19,12:56,Donald Trump,"Now, this is a common malaria drug. It’s also a drug used for strong arthritis. Somebody who has pretty serious arthritis also uses this in a somewhat different form, but it is known as a malaria drug and it’s been around for a long time and it’s very powerful. But the nice part is it’s been around for a long time, so we know that if it … If things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody. When you go with a brand new drug, you don’t know that that’s going to happen. You have to see and you have to go long test. But this has been used in different forms, very powerful drug in different forms and it’s shown very encouraging, very, very encouraging early results, and we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately. And that’s where the FDA has been so great. They’ve gone through the approval process, it’s been approved, and they did it. They took it down from many, many months to immediate."
2020-03-19,14:15,Donald Trump,"So we’re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states … I spoke with governor Cuomo about it at great length last night and he wants to be right on … He wants to be first on the line. And so I think that’s a tremendous … There’s tremendous promise based on the results and other tests. There’s tremendous promise. And normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that and it was approved very, very quickly and it’s now approved by prescription. Individual states will handle it, they can handle it, doctors will handle it. And I think it’s going to be great. Then we’re quickly studying this drug and while we’re continuing to study it, but the studying is going to be also done in … As it’s given out to large groups of people, perhaps in New York and other places."
2020-03-19,15:18,Donald Trump,"We’ll study it there. There are promising therapies produced by Gilead, and that’s remdesivir, remdesivir, and that’s a drug used for other purposes that’s been out, and it’s had very good results for other purposes, but it seems to have a very good result having to do with this virus, and that drug also has been approved or very close to approved, in that case, by the FDA, and I can’t tell you how much we appreciate what the FDA, these people are incredible patriots and the job that Stephen Hahn is doing, Dr. Hahn, who’s one of the most respected doctors in the country by the way, where we took him … I said, “You sure you want to do this?” Now we didn’t know that this was going to be in the playlist of what happened here. But he really has stepped up to the plate, wherever you are."
2020-03-19,16:19,Donald Trump,"Where is he? You really have. I’d shake his hand, but I’m not supposed to do that. Get in a lot of trouble if I did that, but he’s been fantastic and I thank you doctor. He’s going to speak right after I’m finished. So Regeneron, again, is a company that’s done fantastically well as I understand with Ebola and some other things, great company and they’re looking at some very promising events also. So you have remdesivir and you have a hydroxychloroquine. So those are two that are out now, essentially approved for prescribed use. And I think it’s going to be very exciting. I think it could be a game changer, and maybe not and maybe not, but I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful. They’re very powerful."
2020-03-19,17:21,Donald Trump,"So I want every American to know that we’re doing everything we can and these actions are important next steps. I mean, for the FDA to act the way they acted with this kind of speed is an incredible thing. Normally they’d say, “Well, we can have it by next year or we can have it by in two years from now.” You understand, this is the way. Normally it’s like years and years and years, they had it immediately. Based on the fact that it’s been used for other things. Totally unrelated things. We believe these therapeutics and others under evaluation right now will be able to provide relief to many Americans. We really hope that’s going to be, this could be a tremendous breakthrough, tremendous breakthrough, and we will work toward a much needed vaccine in the future, as I said, and what we’re doing with the FDA is so exciting and so many other fields, so many things are happening."
2020-03-19,18:19,Donald Trump,"It’s a very exciting time for medicine, and we appreciate that the American public has pulled together, they’re really staying home and I think there’s tremendous spirit in this country right now. It’s spirit like a lot of people have not seen. People have not seen anything like it for a long time. And that means Democrat, Republican, they’re pulling together. I hope everything’s going good on the hill. Maybe I shouldn’t say this until I check out what’s going on, because you never know. But I think there’s a great spirit where the Democrats, the Republicans and everybody else, they’re getting together, they’re trying to get things done. But most importantly, the American public has been incredible. We took the best economy we’ve ever had and we said, “Stop. You can’t work. You have to stay home.” There’s never been a case like this. Normally you pay a lot of money to get things going."
2020-03-19,19:18,Donald Trump,"Here’s a case where we’re paying a lot of money to stop things because we don’t want people to be together so that this virus doesn’t continue onward. So there’s never been anything like this in history. There’s never been it, nobody’s ever seen anything like this. But we’re doing the right thing, we have to get rid of, and our big war, it’s not a financial war, it’s a war … It’s a medical war. We have to win this war. It’s very important. With that, I’d like to just introduce Dr. Steven Hahn and he, again, I’d like to send back with Steven our thanks to all of the people working in the FDA who are fantastic, talented people. We appreciate it very much. Everything you’ve done, especially the speed that you got, these two elements, these two very important drugs passed. Thank you very much."
2020-03-19,20:11,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank you for your leadership during this coronavirus outbreak, and thank you for the kind words about the FDA staff. We have 10,000 scientists, doctors and others, and more than that, working around the clock to aid the American people in this fight against the coronavirus. And those words are very much appreciated, sir. So before the president nominated me, and I was confirmed as commissioner of food and drugs, I was a cancer doctor and I’ve sat across from countless number of patients and had to talk to them about their diagnosis and their treatment, and one thing that was really important is to provide hope. I have great hope for how we’re going to come out of this situation. What’s also important is not to provide false hope, but to provide hope. And as a doctor, that’s the way I come to this."
2020-03-19,21:03,Dr. Steven Hahn,"I’m speaking now to the American people as commissioner of food and drugs, but that part of me has not left. Just look at the way the American people have responded to our calls for mitigation, for social distancing. The American people had great resiliency, and I am so incredibly proud of how the American people have responded. As the president mentioned, he asked us to be aggressive, to break down barriers to innovation, and to accelerate the development of lifesaving treatments, and we’re doing that at the FDA. The FDA is committed to continuing to provide regulatory flexibility and guidance, but let me make one thing clear. FDA’s responsibility to the American people is to ensure that products are safe and effective and yet we are continuing to do that. Our folks and their tremendous professionals are working day and night to do this. You just can’t even imagine how much they’re working to provide the support for the American people, and I thank them."
2020-03-19,22:01,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Since early January, long before the first domestic case, FDA began working in collaboration with CDC. I also want to note that we stood up an incident command group and had been focused on the coronavirus since the very beginning of this public health emergency. This is, in addition, and all of government and all of America approach, and I’ll describe what I mean by that in terms of the development of therapeutics. An important part of that work is expanding the potential therapeutic options associated with coronavirus, and we’ve learned from our colleagues across the globe about this. But I want to focus on one thing. I was a cancer researcher before all this, and one thing I know about this great country of ours is that we have unbelievable innovators. We have people who every day it’s their job to develop treatments for all sorts of diseases. We are incredibly blessed as a country to have this, and as is true in any illness, these great American innovators, academia, private sector, they have engaged us about the best possible treatment options."
2020-03-19,23:05,Dr. Steven Hahn,"We are looking at everything that’s coming across our desks as possible, treatment options for coronavirus, and we’re extremely encouraged by the interest and the promise that we’ve seen from these great American innovators. Now again, we need to look at it. We need the data, we need the information to make the absolute best decisions for the American people, but I want assure you, we have over 17,000 people at FDA who are doing this every day. We need to make sure that this sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time. As an example, we may have the right drug, but it may not be in the appropriate dosage right now and that may do more harm than good. Those are the things that that’s our job to look at, and that’s why it’s really important we have these dedicated professionals looking at these aspects of therapeutic development."
2020-03-19,23:56,Dr. Steven Hahn,"At the same time, we’re also working through different mechanisms to actually get drugs into the hands of providers and patients. The president mentioned this but one of the mechanisms is called compassionate use. Let me just tell you about this. If there’s an experimental drug that’s potentially available, a doctor could ask for that drug to be used in a patient. We have criteria for that and very speedy approval for that. The important thing about compassionate use, and that’s what the president meant, this is even beyond right to try, is that we get to collect the information about that, because one of the things that I promise the American people is we will collect the data and then make the absolute right decisions based upon those data about the safety and efficacy of the treatments."
2020-03-19,24:38,Dr. Steven Hahn,"We are working expeditiously and we are working to make sure that these products are as safe and effective as they possibly can be. Let me tell you about a few things that we’re currently working on, and this is a plan that was developed with many of the people at this table, our infectious disease experts on the task force. In the short term we’re looking at drugs that are already approved for other indications. So they’re already approved, as the president said, for other diseases. As an example, many Americans have read studies and heard media reports about this drug chloroquine, which is an anti-malarial drug. It’s already approved, as the president said, for the treatment of malaria as well as an arthritis condition. That’s a drug that the president has directed us to take a closer look at as to whether an expanded use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients. And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial, a large pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be asked and answered."
2020-03-19,25:42,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Let me give you another example. There’s a cross agency effort about something called convalescent plasma. This is a pretty exciting area, and again this is something that we have given assistance to other countries with as this crisis has developed, so FDA has been working for some time on this. If you’ve been exposed to coronavirus and you’re better, you don’t have the virus in your blood, we could collect the blood. Now, this is a possible treatment. This is not a proven treatment. Just want to emphasize that. Collect the blood, concentrate that and have the ability, once it’s pathogen free, that it’s virus free. Be able to give that to other patients and the immunoglobulins, the immune response could potentially provide a benefit to patients."
2020-03-19,26:24,Dr. Steven Hahn,"It’s another thing that we’re looking at, over the next couple of weeks we’ll have more information that we’re really pushing hard to try to accelerate that. That’s in the sort of more medium short term, and that’ll be a bridge to other therapies that will take us three to six months to develop, and this is a continuous process. There is no beginning and end to each of this, this is we’re pushing this through. The other great thing about the great innovators of America. Some of them tell us it’s taken us years, years to develop therapies. They’re looking at pushing that to the months period of time, and we’re trying to provide them the regulatory flexibility, but at the same time the scientific oversight to make sure that gets done in the best way possible for the-"
2020-03-19,27:03,Dr. Steven Hahn,"-scientific oversight to make sure that gets done in the best way possible for the American people. The president mentioned that there is a vaccine trial currently being performed. It’s a phase one trial, so it’s the earliest study that gets done. We expect that to take 12 months to get to completion to actually a time where we could approve a vaccine. These are all things to bridge to the prevention part of this with a vaccine. It’s exciting work and the president is right. This is record time for the development of a vaccine and impressive public private partnership."
2020-03-19,27:33,Dr. Steven Hahn,"The FDA’s efforts to facilitate the development of these products are focused on ensuring timely access while also meeting the agency’s world respected gold standard, relyings on strong data from clinical trials to determine if an experimental or an off the shelf drug that’s used for something else can safely and effectively treat patients. We want to assure the American people that FDA is all hands on deck, as the president mentioned these efforts, and continue to work with interested sponsors to help expedite the work. We remain steadfast in helping to foster the development of safe and effective therapies for COVID-19. Thank you."
2020-03-19,28:11,Donald Trump,"Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Mike, talk about the masks."
2020-03-19,28:17,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force have met this morning. And on this very first day of spring, we continue to make steady progress toward President Trump’s objective, not only to marshal all the resources of the federal government, every state government, every local health official, but also to harness the power of the American private sector and activities over the last day reflect all of those priorities."
2020-03-19,28:45,Mike Pence,"Yesterday, the president spoke with America’s top physicians and nurses and garnered helpful insights about how we can best serve those who are serving Americans that are dealing with the coronavirus. We also had a productive call with over 5,000 state and local officials explaining the federal government’s approach and our strong and seamless partnership with all 50 States and the territories."
2020-03-19,29:11,Mike Pence,"Last night, as you heard, the president signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which provides free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, family leave for caregivers and food assistance for the needy among a broad range of benefits. And today, as the president indicated, we expect that the Senate will begin work on an economic relief package."
2020-03-19,29:32,Mike Pence,"Later today, the president and I will meet again in a teleconference with the nation’s governors. We will meet at the National Response Coordination Center at FEMA and outline President Trump’s decision to have FEMA take the lead in our national coronavirus response. Our nation’s response through FEMA will be locally executed, state-managed and federally supported."
2020-03-19,29:59,Mike Pence,"On testing, we want the American people to know once again, that testing is available in all 50 States and is becoming increasingly available literally every hour of the day. Because of the public private partnership that the president initiated several weeks ago with major commercial labs, I’m pleased to receive a report today that tens of thousands of tests are being performed every day. And with the passage of last night’s legislations, that state and private labs are now required by law to report all coronavirus testing directly to the CDC, which will give the American public and also give our researchers timely and important information."
2020-03-19,30:39,Mike Pence,"It’s important for every American to remember that if you don’t have symptoms, you don’t need to get a test. We want to make sure that testing is available for people that are experiencing symptoms or have a genuine concern about having been exposed to someone with the coronavirus."
2020-03-19,30:54,Mike Pence,"Dr. Birx will address county level data as well as the progress we’ve made on testing and Americans can expect to see how an increased number of cases as our new testing system comes online, it should not be a cause of concern. She’ll explain the importance of taking into account our new testing system as new data arrives over the next several days."
2020-03-19,31:16,Mike Pence,"On supplies, a priority the president has given to our task force, we continue to work with healthcare providers, businesses, and state leadership to identify available supplies not merely in the federal stockpile, but much more importantly available across the private sector."
2020-03-19,31:34,Mike Pence,"We’re encouraged to see companies like Honeywell and 3M, that I visited a few short weeks ago, take advantage of the changes in the law last night that allow the sale of industrial masks directly to hospitals. Those companies have now greatly increased, by the tens of millions, their production of so-called N95 masks that will give our healthcare workers the protection that they need to minister to those that are dealing with the symptoms or the disease of coronavirus. I’m following the signing of last night’s bill. All of those masks now have liability protection and the companies can sell industrial masks to hospitals."
2020-03-19,32:16,Mike Pence,"It is encouraging, as we called out yesterday, to see construction companies all across America that are, as we speak, checking their supplies and donating those industrial masks to their local hospitals. And I know I speak on behalf of the president who spent a lot of time as a builder when we thank builders across America for partnering with our local healthcare officials."
2020-03-19,32:38,Mike Pence,"On the subject of ventilators, we’re working with healthcare providers around America and suppliers and we are encouraged to learn that we’ve literally identified tens of thousands of ventilators that can be converted to treat patients. And we remain increasingly confident that we will have the ventilators that we need as the coronavirus makes its way across America."
2020-03-19,33:04,Mike Pence,"And as we said before, we’re all in this together. And before I step away and give the podium back to the president and to Dr. Birx, I want to call every American’s attention again to the president’s 15 Days to Slow the Spread. We continue to hear one case after another, one city after another where people are putting into practice the principles that the president outlined this Monday. And make no mistake about it, that while for the American people as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low, these guidelines should be practiced by every American in every community, not only to lessen the spread of the coronavirus, but to protect the most vulnerable among us."
2020-03-19,33:48,Mike Pence,"And I think Americans with their, with, from their hearts are not only practicing these principles of social distancing and avoiding social gatherings of more than 10 people, using drive-thrus at restaurants, to protect their own health and the health of their family, but they’re also recognizing that no American wants to inadvertently convey the coronavirus to someone for whom the consequences could be quite serious."
2020-03-19,34:13,Mike Pence,"At the president’s direction, we’ll continue to marshal all the resources of government at every level. We’ll be reiterating that strong partnership with America’s States this afternoon and with America’s governors, pulling all of the private sector energy together, the innovation that you just heard described. I know, on this first day of spring, that we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this together. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-19,34:35,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Doctor, please."
2020-03-19,34:39,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. So I know you’re watching the data carefully. You can see the dramatic increases in the number of new cases based on our ability to test additional people, and this will continue over the next two to three days as we begin to have backlogs reduced of the testing. You all have heard the antidotes of people waiting five or six days for their test results. We are moving through all of that as well as testing individuals."
2020-03-19,35:06,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I really want to applaud the frontline healthcare workers, the nurses and the doctors and the testers that have really prioritize, and the American people who have prioritized those with symptoms."
2020-03-19,35:19,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The number of test’s positives is increasing. That is a dramatically important signature that everybody is doing their job. Those with mild symptoms are staying home and self-isolating. Those with serious symptoms are coming forward to getting testing. Our test positive rates are now into the 10 to 11% range. That still means that 90% of the illnesses out there, even the severe ones, are not COVID-19."
2020-03-19,35:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I know many of you are looking at the state level data. Still, over 50% of the cases come from three States. This is why we continue to prioritize testing in those States. In addition, 50% of the cases come from 10 counties. We are a very large country with very many counties and I just want to applaud the local and state governments that are implementing their emergency operations centers and plans to ensure."
2020-03-19,36:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I want to also really thank the health care workers that have been asked to reduce all elective surgeries, medical and dental visits. This will dramatically increase the number of ventilators that are available in hospitals, but also in ambulatory surgical centers that can be converted and utilized. And also, to the construction industry, we are deeply grateful. The number, as vice president said, the number of individuals have come forward with their construction masks, their booties, their tie back suits, and their masks to contribute them to the healthcare sector."
2020-03-19,36:49,Dr. Deborah Birx,The president’s request to make this available in that legislation changes the ability and increases our availability immediately by a then 75 to 90% range because the amount of construction use of those elements. Thank you.
2020-03-19,37:06,Donald Trump,"Thank you, doctor, very much. Jerome, please."
2020-03-19,37:08,Jerome Adams,"Oh, thank you. Thank you, Mr President and Mr. Vice President. Today, you heard a wonderful announcement from the FDA and I just want to give a shout out to Steve, Dr. Hahn and the folks at the FDA whereabout, where several hundred of my commission corps officer’s work. You’re right, Mr. President, they are tireless. They’re doing things that have never been done before to bring the most prudent advances to the American people."
2020-03-19,37:34,Jerome Adams,"But, I want to talk about something different briefly. We know many of you are home practicing the president’s guidelines for social distancing. But one thing we should all consider, especially our millennials and Gen Z, is donating blood."
2020-03-19,37:50,Jerome Adams,"As an anesthesiologist who still practices at Walter Reed taking care of our wounded warriors and our soldiers, I know donated blood is an essential part of caring for patients, and one donation can save up to three lives."
2020-03-19,38:05,Jerome Adams,"Blood centers are open now and in need of your donation. I want America to know that blood donation is safe and blood centers are taking extra precautions at this time based on new CDC recommendations, including spacing beds six feet apart, disinfecting surfaces between patients, temperature checking staff, and encouraging donors to make appointments ahead of time, so we can space them out. Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement, so give blood, today. You’ll feel good about it, and you’ll be helping your country and your community during this crisis and you might even save a life."
2020-03-19,38:46,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Jerome."
2020-03-19,38:46,Jerome Adams,Thank you.
2020-03-19,38:46,John (Reporter),Mr. President.
2020-03-19,38:46,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please. Go ahead, John."
2020-03-19,38:50,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, switching to the efforts to boost the economy with the measures before Congress. Will you guarantee that the money, the billions, the tens of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, even if it’s going to go to these industries will not go to executive bonuses or to more stock buybacks?"
2020-03-19,39:09,Donald Trump,"Well, we don’t want that. In fact, some companies, as you know, did stock buy backs and I was never happy with that. It’s very hard to tell them not to, but I would tell them not to. I would say, I don’t like it for that reason. Some did and it turned out that they could have waited a long time and it would have been much better off if they didn’t."
2020-03-19,39:26,John (Reporter),You can make it a condition of the bill.
2020-03-19,39:28,Donald Trump,We can. We can.
2020-03-19,39:28,John (Reporter),You can say that none of this money can go for that.
2020-03-19,39:31,Donald Trump,"I mean, it takes many, many people in this case to tango. But as far as I’m concerned, that conditions like that would be okay with me."
2020-03-19,39:39,Unnamed (Reporter),Mr. President.
2020-03-19,39:39,Donald Trump,John.
2020-03-19,39:40,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, if I could, a question for you and then a question for Dr. Hahn. You enabled, I guess is probably the best way to put it, the Defense Production Act yesterday."
2020-03-19,39:48,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-19,39:49,John (Reporter),"But, you didn’t pull the trigger on it."
2020-03-19,39:50,Donald Trump,"No, because we hope we’re not going to need that."
2020-03-19,39:51,John (Reporter),You’re getting a lot of calls on Capitol Hill from the Democratic leadership to pull the trigger on it. What’s the rationale for not doing that?
2020-03-19,39:58,Donald Trump,"First of all, governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work and they are doing a lot of this work. The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. We’re not a shipping clerk. The governors are supposed to be, as with testing, the governors are supposed to be doing it. We’ll help out and we’ll help out wherever we can. And we can buy in volume and in some cases, great volume with the masks as an example, which were really a problem. We have helped out and they’re right now millions of masks being made. But, this is really for the local governments, the governors and people within the state depending on the way they divided it up. And they’ll do that, and they’re doing a very good job of it."
2020-03-19,40:39,Donald Trump,"Where you have a problem with ventilators, we’re working very hard trying to find… Nobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we’d need tens of thousands of ventilators. This is something that’s very unique to this, to what happened."
2020-03-19,40:52,John (Reporter),Under what conditions would you put the Defense Production Act into action?
2020-03-19,40:56,Donald Trump,"Well, if we were desperately in need of something and we, frankly will know about that very shortly, we want to be ahead of it. We don’t want to do it as it happens, but before it happens. We’re going to know a lot over the next two or three days. We’ll know a lot."

2020-03-19,41:09,John (Reporter),For Dr. Hahn.

2020-03-19,41:11,John (Reporter),Dr. Hahn.
2020-03-19,41:12,Dr. Steven Hahn,Yes.
2020-03-19,41:13,John (Reporter),Any idea when remdesivir will be available to the market? And are there any drugs in the pipeline that you believe could qualify for a treatment IMD?
2020-03-19,41:23,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So with respect to the first question, I’m prohibited by law to disclose confidential commercial information. What I can tell you is, we’re working very closely with the company on this and we’ll have additional information, they will, relatively soon. Yes, there are drugs in the pipeline. We’re looking at everyone. Everyone on this [dyas 00:41:41] gets calls every day as do all of our people at the FDA about potential therapeutic options. We are looking at every single one of them."

2020-03-19,41:51,Unnamed (Reporter),"Two questions for you, one on coronavirus, but just really quickly, are you confirming that Austin Tice is still alive?"
2020-03-19,41:56,Donald Trump,"No, I’m not, but we’re trying to find that out. This has been going on for years. Many years they’ve been trying to find Austin Tice. He was in Syria, as you know. His mother is an incredible woman and I’m doing it for him, but I’m doing it for his mother. His mother is an incredible woman who is desperate to find her son. And I’m not confirming a lot, but if he is alive, we would like very much to get him back quickly."
2020-03-19,42:25,Unnamed (Reporter),"Okay. And on coronavirus, speaking of shortages of supplies, the CDC has put out guidelines for hospitals that are dealing with a shortage of masks to use them beyond their shelf life, and reuse them instead of getting new ones, and in a worst case scenario, use a bandana instead of a mask. How is that acceptable at all?"
2020-03-19,42:45,Donald Trump,"Well, I haven’t seen that, but I will let Mike answer that question. Vice President."
2020-03-19,42:50,Mike Pence,"Yeah, I’m happy to Mr. President. I can’t emphasize enough the incredible progress that was made with the passage of the legislation last night. The president had me go to Minnesota and meet with 3M that manufacturers these N95 masks a few weeks ago. And we learned of their production at that facility of 35 million masks a month. Less than five million of those were qualified to be sold to hospitals. So the president worked with Republican and Democrat leadership. We’ve extended the liability protection, so now that all the industrial masks that are manufactured as N95s are now available to hospitals."
2020-03-19,43:26,Mike Pence,"And we’re seeing a dramatic increase in production. Honeywell alone is repurposing a factory that was destined for Mexico to produce another 120 million masks per year. 3M is increasing output to 420 million masks per year. We’ve put a priority, at the president’s direction, on making sure those that are providing healthcare services to America have the protection to keep themselves and their families safe. And with the legislation last night, with the incredible response among these great private sector companies and as we mentioned repeatedly, with construction companies around America heeding the president’s call to donate their industrial masks to hospitals, it’s happening all over America, we know we’ll meet that need."
2020-03-19,44:11,Unnamed (Reporter),"But, when will those be ready? [crosstalk 00:44:12] Isn’t that kind of [crosstalk 00:44:13] sad they have to use a ban…"
2020-03-19,44:15,Donald Trump,"How many masks are being made and when will they be ready, or at least we start getting them ready?"
2020-03-19,44:18,Mike Pence,"Well, as I mentioned, 3M is increasing their output to 420 million a year. At the production in January, they make 35 million per month at that facility. We are prioritizing the distribution of those."
2020-03-19,44:34,Mike Pence,"But the other thing, and we’ll emphasize this with governors this afternoon, is we’re working with governors to make sure that the healthcare providers, the hospitals and the clinics in their state are placing orders now that this tremendous increase in supply, particularly with industrial masks, is now available. We’re going to make sure they understand that the supply has greatly expanded thanks to a bipartisan legislation and the accomplishment of the president and the response by these companies is making more masks available. And we’re going to make sure healthcare providers are purchasing those and the federal government will also make sure that our stockpile is properly reflects those increases as well."
2020-03-19,45:12,Group,[crosstalk 00:45:12].
2020-03-19,45:12,Unnamed (Reporter),"On the president’s question, when will those masks be ready for, because they need them today."
2020-03-19,45:21,Mike Pence,"They’re available now. The 3M facility that I was at told me that in January they went to full production on 35 million masks. The legislative change means that all 35 million of those that started to be produced at full capacity in January can now be sold to hospitals. That’s the distinction here. It’s a very important change and it’s part of the way the president has been engaging the private sector and pushing the kind of regulatory reform and the kind of liability reform that has greatly expanded the availability of masks, so they’re in the marketplace now."
2020-03-19,45:55,Mike Pence,"We’re going to make it clear to governors as we made it clear to healthcare providers in conference calls yesterday that those resources are now there. We’ve vastly increased the supply of medical masks and we’re going to continue to put a priority on making sure that we’re calling on industry at every level, calling on major suppliers that the president met with this week, to make sure that those personal protective equipment are there for our healthcare workers."
2020-03-19,46:19,Donald Trump,Some of that had to do with the liability in the company. They had a big problem with liability and much of it had to do with the liability to the company.

2020-03-19,46:26,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, thank you. Two for you and one for Dr. Hahn. The American Hospital Association just told NBC News that they need $100 billion dollars in order to adjust shortages in equipment and other infrastructure there. You just signed two legislative packages. They say it didn’t directly give money to address this issue. Why not? And will you commit to making sure they get the money they need?"
2020-03-19,46:50,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at that issue directly with them. And that’s a separate issue, but we’re looking at that issue very directly."
2020-03-19,46:58,Unnamed (Reporter),Will you make sure and commit to [crosstalk 00:46:59] giving them the money that they need.
2020-03-19,46:59,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to do our best on it, but we’re working with Democrats and Republicans on that. We’re looking at that very specifically."
2020-03-19,47:07,Unnamed (Reporter),"Can you bottom line people, when can Americans expect their lives to go back to normal? Will that not happen until there is a vaccine?"
2020-03-19,47:13,Donald Trump,"Yeah. I hope very soon. We’ll see. This is uncharted territory, as you know. We think we have ideas and does it help to say what the idea are? I would hope very soon. We’ve pulled together as a nation. People are, for the most part, doing what they’re supposed to be doing. The social distancing is very interesting. A whole new term that’s become a hot, it’s become somewhat of a hot term, but people are listening and they’re really doing a great job. This country is an amazing country. I think you’re up to 141 different countries right now, so it’s very uncharted territory."
2020-03-19,47:48,Donald Trump,"It could have been stopped. It could have been stopped pretty easily if we had known, if everybody had known about it a number of months before people started reading about it."
2020-03-19,47:58,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, you said, you didn’t-"
2020-03-19,47:58,Donald Trump,"Excuse me, excuse me. Before we started reading about it, we could have, it could have been stopped in its tracks. Unfortunately, they didn’t decide to make it public, but the whole world is suffering because of it."
2020-03-19,48:10,Unnamed (Reporter),"You did say a few days ago though, you did have a sense that this was a pandemic that was coming, so why was the United States not prepared with more testing and surprised?"
2020-03-19,48:18,Donald Trump,"We were very prepared. The only thing we weren’t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly. I’ll tell you how prepared I was, I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was… In fact, it was your network, I believe they called me a racist because I did that. It was many of the people in the room, they call me racist and other words because I did that because I went so early. So when you say we weren’t prepared, had I let these tens of thousands of people come in from China a day, we would have had something right now that would have been, you wouldn’t have even recognized it compared to where we are."
2020-03-19,48:58,Donald Trump,"How many people have passed away? How many people have died as of this moment? You could multiply that by a factor of many, many, many. So when you say that I wasn’t prepared, I was the first one to do the ban. Now other countries are following what I did, but the media doesn’t acknowledge that."

One of the things that happened this morning, I spoke with Micky Arison of Carnival Cruise Lines and he’s going to make ships available. So in addition to the big medical ships that you have coming, if we should need ships with lots of rooms, they’ll be docked at New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco and different places.

2020-03-19,50:29,Donald Trump,"I can only tell you that as an example, masks, nobody ever heard of the number of masks that’s been ordered and they’re being made now and many are available now. But people, I think in the media probably don’t know that."

Could you explain the gap, and for the American people, and what you’re saying here today about there being tens of thousands of tests available about how they’re being a huge amount of masks available and what we’re seeing on the ground, which is really the opposite of that? People are saying that they can’t get tested even when they have symptoms. People are saying that they, doctors are telling us they don’t have access to vital equipment. Can you explain that gap?"
2020-03-19,51:10,Donald Trump,"I cannot explain a gap. I’m hearing very good things on the ground and we’re dealing with… Look, they had a ramp up. They had an obsolete system and they had a system simultaneously that was not meant for this. It wasn’t meant for this. Nobody knew there’d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion. Nobody has ever seen anything like this before."
2020-03-19,51:27,Donald Trump,"I can tell you that what we’re doing is we’re working with local governments, with States, governors, even mayors on getting them to be able to get what they need and the system is starting to work out very well. But we had to break a system, like breaking an egg because the system we had was obsolete and didn’t work and that was a system we inherited. And now, we have something that’s really been very good and certainly going to be great for the future too. Yeah, [inaudible 00:51:52]."

What do you say to [crosstalk 00:52:13]?"
2020-03-19,52:14,Donald Trump,"Well, we don’t want to pick winners and losers. We want everybody to benefit. We want, I think more than anything else, the workers to benefit. And sometimes for the worker to benefit, you have to go through the company because they have thousands of workers. And if the company goes out of business, no fault of their own, those workers aren’t going to be able to receive a check."
2020-03-19,52:31,Donald Trump,"Look, our ultimate goal are the people. Our ultimate goal are the great people of this country and we will have things worked out, I think that are going to be very well. It’s a very complex formula, you understand that. It’s very complex, but it’s working out. I think it’s going to be very well. I think we’re going to have pretty uniform support for it. Please."

2020-03-19,53:01,Donald Trump,I can’t say right now because I haven’t had the meeting yet.
2020-03-19,53:04,Group,[crosstalk 00:26:04].
2020-03-19,53:04,Unnamed (Reporter),"Thank you, President Trump. I wanted to ask Dr. Hahn about today’s announcement if I could?"
2020-03-19,53:09,Donald Trump,"Oh, please."
2020-03-19,53:13,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Hahn, thank you so much. I wanted to ask about remdesivir, if I hope I pronounce that correctly. Can you say, is it currently approved for use on the virus?"
2020-03-19,53:22,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So remdesivir and it’s a drug made by Gilead. That’s been in the press. It is currently in clinical trials here and around the world. We have also made it available by that approach that I told you called, compassionate use, where a doctor could ask the FDA for that. And the really positive thing about that, that gives it rapidly to a doctor and a patient. But it allows us to collect the data because what we really need to do is understand what the data and science are in order to make the appropriate decision about safety and effectiveness."
2020-03-19,53:54,Unnamed (Reporter),"So how do you just make sure that it is safe. And I mean, is there any concern at all that it will be safe considering that it’s not going through the normal-"
2020-03-19,54:03,Dan,… that it will be safe considering that it’s not going through the normal process and could potentially cause negative effects. Dr Fauci earlier talked about we do not want to put out anything that could cause a negative effect. Is there any concern about those kind of things with this drug?
2020-03-19,54:15,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Dan, thank you for that question because I just want to be clear about this. Remdesivir is going through the normal process. We are using our internal processes at FDA to set up with the company the protocols to actually collect the data. And you’re right, we need to actually know about the safety and the effectiveness, and that’s done through the clinical trial process. So it’s those data that are going to inform the decisions that are ultimately made about safety and efficacy. This is an unprecedented situation. This is a really significant time. And one thing that, with the president’s leadership, FDA has done is said, “Okay, how do we approach these extraordinary times with extraordinary measures knowing that we have a sacred trust with the American people about safety and efficacy, but still at the same time enable these treatments to get into patients?” And that’s what we’re doing. [crosstalk 00:55:10]"
2020-03-19,55:10,Donald Trump,Jeff.
2020-03-19,55:11,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, one for you and one for the doctors. How likely is it that the 15-day guidance that you have with Rube will be extended-"
2020-03-19,55:19,Donald Trump,I can only tell you on the 14th day and we’ll have to see. We’ll have indications later on.
2020-03-19,55:24,Jeff (Reporter),"Dr. Birx indicated that there are three states and 10 counties, if I got that right, where 50% of the cases are focused. Should those areas be doing more measures such as shelter in place?"
2020-03-19,55:35,Donald Trump,"I think they actually are doing a lot. I mean, I know New York is working very diligently, been very strong. I assume San Francisco is one of the areas and Los Angeles and the state of Washington, obviously. That’s one that has to be up there. They’re all working very hard to quarantine or words just about the equivalent of quarantine."
2020-03-19,55:59,Jeff (Reporter),And what is your planter for government workers? Are you moving for the government as well to start doing more teleworking?
2020-03-19,56:05,Donald Trump,"We are and we’re using the medical term of telemedicine, and it’s been incredibly busy and really what people don’t have to… I mean, some people can’t do it anyway. They can’t get up. They can’t see a doctor. But we’re using this and it’s been tele-health, different names, and I will tell you that it’s been really successful and it’s helped a lot of people out where they don’t have to and they can’t. And even from a safety reason, if they are positive, if they are feeling poorly, they can’t do it, or we don’t want them transmitting anything to anybody else. [crosstalk 00:56:41] All right, John."
2020-03-19,56:42,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, if I could, on China, they reported for the first time since the outbreak no new cases over a 24-hour period. Do you have any reason to disbelieve them? And second to that, the National Security Council yesterday put out a tweet very critical of the Chinese government saying the Chinese Communist Party suppressed initial reports on the Chinese virus and punished doctors and journalists causing Chinese and international experts to miss critical opportunities to prevent a global pandemic. Could you explain that?"
2020-03-19,57:11,Donald Trump,"Well, it would’ve been much better if we had known about this a number of months earlier. It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started. And certainly the world is paying a big price for what they did and the world is paying a very big price for not letting them come out. Everybody knows that. We all know that. As far as believing what they’re putting out now, I hope it’s true. Who knows? But I hope it’s true. [crosstalk 00:57:38]"
2020-03-19,57:41,Unnamed,"Quickly a question for you and then also for the doctor if possible. You’ve been talking about China quite a bit and you’ve been talking about the Chinese virus, how if you have heard about this from day one and had more information, possibly you could have stopped it."
2020-03-19,57:55,Donald Trump,Big difference.
2020-03-19,57:56,Unnamed,Are you thinking about any types of repercussions for China? And are you also rethinking sort of the supply lines for our manufacturing industry?
2020-03-19,58:04,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to comment on that right now. Yeah, please."
2020-03-19,58:08,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I have a question for you and also a question for Dr. Birx if you… American workers across the country are losing their jobs at an unprecedented rate and your former economist said we could see some of the worst job numbers ever. Is the government prepared to see this spike in unemployment?"
2020-03-19,58:26,Donald Trump,"Worst case scenario you would have terrible job numbers. If we can get this thing wrapped up and finished earlier things will go very nicely. One of the things they’re working, as you know, one of the elements that is being worked on very much so in the Hill is to keep the jobs going so that when we do get rid of the virus, we’re going to be able to just really, I think, go like a rocket. I think the economy’s going to be fantastic. Now, when he said that he was using that as the ultimate bad outcome. I don’t think anybody believes that’s going to happen. [crosstalk 00:59:02] Go ahead. You."
2020-03-19,59:04,Unnamed,Members of Congress are now being tested positive for… Members of Congress are now being tested positive for coronavirus. You have almost two dozen who are self-quarantining. Do you have any guidance for Congress should they-
2020-03-19,59:20,Donald Trump,"I know all of them, and I don’t know if they’re sitting like you people are sitting. You’re actually sitting too close. Really we should probably get rid of about another 75, 80% of you. I’ll have just two or three that I like in this room. I think that’s a great way of doing it. We just figured a new way of doing it. But you’re actually much too close. You two, you should leave immediately. But, look, I know all of them. They tested positive. Hopefully they’re all going to get better. And it’s one of those things. It’s Congress. It’s one of those things."
2020-03-19,59:56,Unnamed,Should they keep going to the Hill or should they…
2020-03-19,59:58,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t think they’re going to the Hill. I mean, I know some where they tested positive, they’re in quarantine. I know Lindsey and many others, they didn’t test, but until they got the result, they put themselves in quarantine. A number of people in Congress right now are in quarantine. They don’t know the results. When they get the result, they’ll either stay there and get better… Because people get better. I mean, most people are getting better. Most, by far, the people, you get better. Doesn’t mean it’s not a tough one. It is a tough one, but no. Many people in Congress have felt not perfect or they met somebody that wasn’t perfect. It turned out to be positive and they’ve put themselves in quarantine. I think Congress has behaved unbelievably well in that regard. [crosstalk 01:00:49]"
2020-03-19,01:00:48,Unnamed,"Mr, President, on the stimulus, sir, given what is happening to the economy, do you think a trillion dollar stimulus is enough?"
2020-03-19,01:00:54,Donald Trump,"We’ll know about that later. We’ll see what happens. So much depends on what’s going on in this room in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its tracks, the virus, it’s plenty. If we can’t, we’ll have to go back and talk."
2020-03-19,01:01:08,Unnamed,Do you support the idea of the government taking an equity stake in certain companies?
2020-03-19,01:01:13,Donald Trump,I do. I really do.
2020-03-19,01:01:15,Unnamed,Which companies [crosstalk 01:01:15]
2020-03-19,01:01:15,Donald Trump,"I’m not going to say, but I think so. Look, people are coming in for money, in some cases no fault of their own, but in some cases where they did certain things over the course of the years, including buying back stock, they bought back stock and they paid a high price for it as it turned out. But maybe I view that as a little bit differently than somebody that didn’t and somebody that built plants all over the United States, of which there were plenty of them too."
2020-03-19,01:01:43,Unnamed,So would you consider airlines or Boeing? What are you thinking of?
2020-03-19,01:01:46,Donald Trump,"We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry. We’ll probably be… where jobs are created. You don’t want to lose industries like this. These are incredible industries. You can’t lose them. So we’ll be focused on many industries. And I have to say, I can’t say that struggle enough, we will be helping small businesses. That’s where it’s complicated because there’s a lot of small… That’s the engine of the country. We will be helping small businesses. [crosstalk 01:02:16]"
2020-03-19,01:02:19,Unnamed,"These two members of Congress that have tested positive for coronavirus, these will be votes that you need to pass this $1 trillion stimulus package for the economy. Do you expect this to slow down the delivery of checks for American families? And are you considering any executive action?"
2020-03-19,01:02:38,Donald Trump,"No. There could be. We’re looking at a couple of things that I could do. Hopefully won’t need it, but we can do. There’s a lot of executive power. If we don’t have to use it, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing. Yeah, please."
2020-03-19,01:02:47,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. One for you and potentially, as well, one for either Dr. Birx or Dr. Adams. Right now the economy is essentially ground to a halt-"
2020-03-19,01:02:55,Donald Trump,Thanks for telling us. We appreciate it.
2020-03-19,01:02:56,Unnamed,Stores have closed. Travel has slowed down-
2020-03-19,01:03:00,Donald Trump,Go ahead. What’s the rest of your question? We know that. Everybody in the room knows that.
2020-03-19,01:03:03,Unnamed,"The question is how long should those who are either not working right now or business owners who have to make critical decisions, how long should they expect the state of affairs as it stands at this moment to play out? And for the doctors behind you-"
2020-03-19,01:03:17,Donald Trump,"We’ll be able to tell you that very, I think, in the near future. We’ll see where we’re going. You’re going to see numbers. You’ve seen the graphs. You’re going to see numbers and we’ll be able to let you know. I will say that the American public has been incredible for the most part, not in all cases, but for the most part. So you’ll be able to see what’s happening over the next… As we say, we had a 15-day period. You’ll be able to tell a lot in a week or so, not everything, but we’ll be able to see over a period of time. [crosstalk 01:03:46]"
2020-03-19,01:03:46,Unnamed,"Okay, and for all the parents that are home right now, and this is a question for Dr. Birx or Dr. Adams, who are caring for their children and are curious as to when might my kids be able to go back to school, what do you think is a realistic timeline?"
2020-03-19,01:04:02,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, I think you know all of those decisions are made at the state and local government level, and each state and local government has handled it differently. That’s why we put out from the president federal presidential guidance to every single person about what we think is important for the next two weeks. And as we look at that data we’ll be able to see if it’s having an impact. I think you’ve all seen the modeling studies. Those were driven by the modeling studies showing that if you add these things together, they have a bigger impact than separately. And so those are part of the decision making. We had a whole group of modelers in yesterday. They’re compositing all the data together to look at this carefully because everyone has those same questions of what the impact will be and what pieces could essentially be removed and you still have the same level of impact in decreasing the spread of the virus. The absolute key to this, though, is every single American looking at the president guidelines and taking it seriously, the acts of selflessness that I am seeing are so impressive across the board. But if even 10 or 15% of the population decides that what they’re doing today is more important than the health and welfare of the rest of the Americans, they can spread the virus in a very strong way because you know the level of contagion."
2020-03-19,01:05:22,Unnamed,"Do you have a general timeline, Doctor?"
2020-03-19,01:05:22,Donald Trump,"And I have to say if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine works or any of the other things that they’re looking at that are not quite as far out, but if they work, your numbers are going to come down very rapidly. So we’ll see what happens, but there’s a real chance that they might work. Go ahead, please, in the back."
2020-03-19,01:05:41,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you so much. What is your message for some leaders in Latin America, like the president of Brazil who just on Sunday was taking photos with supporters encouraging mass demonstration? And just yesterday president from Brazil said that we should not be surprised if we see him in the next few days in a crowded subway and San Paolo or on a bus and Rio because he is the president and should be with the people. What do you think about that? What is your message?"
2020-03-19,01:06:09,Donald Trump,"Well, he’s a friend of mine, number one. And number two, we had dinner the other night and everybody said he was positive and he wasn’t positive. He tested negative, so I was quite happy when I heard that. But I have no message for him other than he’s doing a good job in Brazil. He’s doing a good job in Brazil and he’s very popular."
2020-03-19,01:06:26,Unnamed,How about encouraging mass demonstration at this moment?
2020-03-19,01:06:29,Donald Trump,I can’t tell you about that. I don’t know about that. I have not heard that. He’s doing a very good job. Brazil was very troubled before he got there. The people love him and is popular. I think he’s doing a very good job. [crosstalk 01:06:44]
2020-03-19,01:06:46,Unnamed,"Mr. President, there are Americans who were traveling abroad who are essentially stuck, unable to come home. We spoke to a group of-"
2020-03-19,01:06:52,Donald Trump,In Peru?
2020-03-19,01:06:53,Unnamed,… 10 women who… Americans-
2020-03-19,01:06:55,Donald Trump,Where? Where?
2020-03-19,01:06:56,Unnamed,"Well, we spoke to 10 American women who are in Morocco, for instance. All the flights have been canceled. Their hotel is shutting down. They literally have no place to stay and no way to get home. They are asking you, they’re asking the administration, the US government, for help. What can be done?"
2020-03-19,01:07:13,Donald Trump,"We know about it. We have groups. We have a group of young people in Peru, and we’re working on taking care of that with the military."
2020-03-19,01:07:22,Unnamed,So military evacuations.
2020-03-19,01:07:23,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we’re looking at… No, not evacuation. We’re trying to get them out, and they got caught. They were late with their flights. We gave them a period of time. They didn’t make it, but we’re looking to get them out with military, probably through the military. We have a group of young people, I think young men or young people, could be women also with them, from Alabama, the great state of Alabama. They’re in Peru and we’re working on that right now trying to get them out. It’s a large group. It’s about 300. We’re going to work it out. Jeff?"
2020-03-19,01:07:54,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, two sort of foreign policy-related questions. In your talk with the G7 leaders earlier this week, did you discuss together ending or postponing the Olympics?"
2020-03-19,01:08:03,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we did discuss it. As you know, Prime Minister Abe was on the call, and that’s a big decision for him. We don’t know what his decision is, but we’d live with his decision. It’s a tough situation. They’ve done an incredible job. Japan has done an incredible job when building the venues, getting them built. You’ve seen so many Olympic venues that have been a disaster over the years where they cost five times more than they’re supposed to, they weren’t ready in time. Japan has been just the opposite. They built it beautifully. They built it for what it was supposed to be built for. But then he got hit with the same thing that the rest of the world got hit with unexpectedly. He has told us that he has not made a decision as to what to do."
2020-03-19,01:08:47,Jeff (Reporter),"And also on foreign policy, have you spoken to the leaders of Saudi Arabia or Russia and encouraged them to stop this glut of oil that is affecting the market?"
2020-03-19,01:08:55,Donald Trump,"Well, the one thing I will tell you is that from the standpoint, you always get a little bit torn because until we became the leading producer, I was always for the person driving the car and filling up the tank of gas and you’d have gasoline. And the prices, if they were too high, I would always raise hell with OPEC. I was always somebody that likes it. And I never thought I’d see 22 and 24 and $28 a barrel, but that’s what we have. And in one way our consumer is very much helped. It’s like a massive tax increase. That’s bigger than any tax decrease that you could give. We can give all these big tax cuts, but they’re paying so little for gasoline. But on the other hand, it hurts a great industry and a very powerful industry. So I spoke with numerous people that have a lot to do with it, and we have a lot of power over the situation. We’re trying to find some kind of a medium ground. It’s very devastating to Russia because when you look, I mean, their whole economy is based on that. We have the lowest oil prices in decades, so it’s very devastating to Russia. I would say it’s very bad for Saudi Arabia, but they were in a fight. They were in a fight on price. They’re in a fight on output and at the appropriate time I’ll get involved. [crosstalk 01:10:21]"
2020-03-19,01:10:21,John (Reporter),"Forgive me if I missed it, what will the Carnival cruise ships be used for?"
2020-03-19,01:10:25,Donald Trump,"Well, Mickey called up and he said if you need them and we haven’t said yes, I’ll call Governor Cuomo. I’ll call Gavin, Gavin Newsom, governor from California I’ll call. A few of the other governors are going to bring it up today because we’re meeting through phone, through telephone, telephonically as they say, in a little while at FEMA. I’m going over to FEMA from here."
2020-03-19,01:10:48,John (Reporter),Are you thinking increased hospital beds?
2020-03-19,01:10:48,Donald Trump,"Well, you can increase places to stay. Let’s say places to stay, if it works. I mean, I don’t know, maybe people won’t want them. But he made the offer. It was a very generous offer, and he said that he has some ships that would be ideally suited for what we’re doing. And certainly they have a lot of rooms. They’re big and they have a lot of rooms, so we appreciate it from Carnival. [crosstalk 01:11:13] Go ahead."
2020-03-19,01:11:14,Unnamed,"At what point in the future will any American who wants a test be able to get a test? Because you’re talking about not needing a test right now if you’re not showing any symptoms, but a lot of us-"
2020-03-19,01:11:22,Donald Trump,Not needing the tests?
2020-03-19,01:11:24,Unnamed,Or only getting tested if you’re showing symptoms. But a lot of this-
2020-03-19,01:11:27,Donald Trump,"Well, no, you should only get… I didn’t have any symptoms and I got a test, but I got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy. So that’s the only reason. I had no symptoms, but I had a test. My doctor told me, “Don’t get it. You don’t need it. Everybody said you don’t need it.” But I had to do it because the press was going crazy. And then after I got it, they said, “You shouldn’t have gotten it. You had no symptoms,” the whole thing. So in other words if you get it, it was no good, but I’m a unique case unfortunately. But no, people that don’t show symptoms and people that have doctors that say they shouldn’t get it, I would rely on that, yeah. I would rely on that. [crosstalk 01:12:05]"
2020-03-19,01:12:09,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you. I have two questions. Do you consider the term Chinese-"

2020-03-19,01:12:16,Donald Trump,Very good. Thank you very much.
2020-03-19,01:12:19,Unnamed,I have two questions-
2020-03-19,01:12:19,Donald Trump,They treat me very nicely. Go ahead.
2020-03-19,01:12:20,Unnamed,Do you consider the term Chinese food racist because it’s food that originates in China or it has Chinese-
2020-03-19,01:12:26,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t think it’s racist at all."
2020-03-19,01:12:29,Unnamed,"On that note, major left wing news media, even in this room, have teamed up with Chinese Communist Party narratives, and they are claiming you are racist for making these claims about Chinese virus. Is it alarming that major media players just [inaudible 01:12:44] you are consistently siding with foreign state propaganda, Islamic radicalism, Latin gangs and cartels, and they work right here at the White House with direct access to you and your team?"
2020-03-19,01:12:56,Donald Trump,"It amazes me when I read the things that I read. It amazes me when I read the Wall Street Journal, which is always so negative. It amazes me when I read… The New York Times is not even… I barely read it. We don’t distribute it in the White House anymore, and the same thing with the Washington Post because, you see, I know the truth. People out there in the world, they really don’t know the truth. They don’t know what it is. They use different slogans and different concepts for me almost every week trying to catch something. Last week it was, okay… As you see me, there’s no chaos. I have no chaos. I’m the one telling everybody to be calm. There’s no chaos at the White House. We have unbelievable professionals. It’s really, I mean, I think I came up with the term. I hope I came up with the term, but it is fake news. It’s more than fake news. It’s corruptness. They write stories without calling anybody, they write a story. Today, I had a couple of stories where… They never call me, ever, that I know of. At least nobody tells me. They’ll write a story about me without even asking my opinion on something. It’s totally fake."
2020-03-19,01:14:04,Donald Trump,"I mean, there is a story in the Wall Street Journal today about how we’ve done. We’ve done a phenomenal job on this. The governors even, even Gavin Newsom, who I’m usually fighting with over the fires and I think you should do a different kind of a job in the forest and lots of things. We argue a lot, but Gavin Newsom has been very, very generous. Andrew Cuomo has been really very generous. I mean, they’re saying we’re doing a great job and everybody is saying. But then you’ll read this phony story in the Wall Street Journal, or the Washington Post is going wild lately. I don’t know what happened to them. I guess something happened like we don’t call them back or whatever. But the Washington Post… These are very dishonest media sources. They’re very dishonest. And you know what? Someday, hopefully in five years, I won’t be here and that’ll be fine. I will have done, I think, a great job. Because I don’t think anyone’s done as much in three and a half years as I’ve done, I don’t think, and the administration. This administration has done a great job. But the press is very dishonest."
2020-03-19,01:15:13,Unnamed,But more than dishonest. They’re siding with state propaganda over-
2020-03-19,01:15:17,Donald Trump,"Well, I think they do. I mean, they are siding with China. They are doing things that they shouldn’t be doing. They’re siding with many others. China’s the least of it. So why they’re doing this, you’ll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place. [crosstalk 01:15:33]"
2020-03-19,01:15:32,Donald Trump,"So ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We are very excited about, specifically, what we talked about with the chloroquine. I think it could be something really incredible. It could totally depress the times that we had mentioned. [crosstalk 01:15:53] Wait. Excuse me, excuse me. It could totally depress any time that we’re talking about if it works. There are a lot of reasons that I have to believe, again, Dr. Hahn is the expert, but a lot of reasons that I would have to think that it could have a very positive effect or a positive effect, maybe not very, but maybe positive. I think it’s, to me, very, very exciting. And the beauty is, I think I can say this, Steve, the beauty is that these drugs have been out there so the really danger part of the drugs, especially chloroquine, it’s been out there for years so we know it’s something that can be taken safely. So it’s very important. [crosstalk 01:16:33]"
2020-03-19,01:16:32,Unnamed (Reporter),Can I ask the doctor a question about that?
2020-03-19,01:16:41,Donald Trump,Go ahead. Go ahead.
2020-03-19,01:16:41,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Hahn, can you just give a little bit more information about that, the process by which folks are going to be able to actually use these medicines? Because I believe there were at least two, maybe more. How quickly do you think we will be able to use them? And then if you can update us on the vaccine. I know it was fast-tracked."
2020-03-19,01:16:54,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Well, the president has asked us to expedite this. And what I want to assure you because of the questions that were asked, we want to make sure that this is done well and right for the American people. The president is right, with an off the shelf drug we do have a lot of information about the side effects of the drug, so that really helps in terms of expediting. But I want to assure you that we’re working as quickly as we can. I don’t want to speculate about a timeline at this point. With respect to vaccines, that’s in phase one trial as I mentioned. We’re expecting that to proceed moving forward, and we’re working with a number of different other companies about vaccine development."
2020-03-19,01:17:28,Unnamed (Reporter),The president had noted phase one was fast-tracked. Is it possible phase two and phase three can be fast-tracked that we might see a vaccine before that year? You said it could potentially be a year.
2020-03-19,01:17:37,Dr. Steven Hahn,"This is a terrific question, and we are really trying hard at FDA to partner with great industry, great academic partners do exactly that. No promises can be made, but one thing that we’re doing is really working hard to fast track as much as possible."
2020-03-19,01:17:52,Donald Trump,"And they are. [crosstalk 01:17:53] We’re going to have other times to meet. We’ll be meeting, hopefully not for very long. I mean, I would like to see this get cleared up, and we think we’ve… To me, this was a very important conference because I really think there’s great potential here. A lot of people are going to be trying it soon, literally very soon, literally in a matter of days, if not sooner in some cases. It’s already being experimented with and there’s been some very good results. We’ll see what happens, but if we can be even partially right, maybe we’ll be fully right, but even partially right on it, this whole subject becomes a much more pleasant subject. So thank you all. We’re going over to FEMA now, so I don’t know who’s going. But we’re going to FEMA. We’re going to be discussing with the governors and lots of other people. Now I think that’s enough. Thank you. [crosstalk 01:18:46] Thank you, everybody. [crosstalk 01:18:50]"
2020-03-19,01:18:52,Unnamed,"Dr. Hahn, will people actually be using these drugs in a couple of days?"
2020-03-20,04:25,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. I had a very good telephone conversation, extremely good with Senator Schumer a little while ago. We’re working on various elements of the deal and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will. I spoke at length with Mitch McConnell and there’s tremendous spirit to get something done, so we’ll see what happens. But my conversation was very good with Senator Schumer. I thank you all for joining us and I’d like to begin by providing an update on what we are doing to minimize the impact of the Chinese virus on our nations students. With many schools closed due to the virus, the Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing requirements. Very importantly for students in elementary through high school, for the current year. They’ve been through a lot."
2020-03-20,05:26,Donald Trump,"They’ve been going back and forth, schools open, schools not open. It’s been all standardized testing and we’re not going to be enforcing that. So I think you can let the people know. I think probably a lot of the students would be extremely happy. Some probably not. The ones that work hard, maybe not, but it’s one of those things. Unfortunately, very unfortunate circumstance. We’ve also temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans. There’ll be very happy to hear that. And I’ve instructed them to take that action immediately. And today, Secretary DeVos has directed federal lenders to allow borrowers to suspend their student loans and loan payments without penalty for at least the next 60 days. And if we need more, we’ll extend that period of time. Borrowers should contact their lenders, but we’ve given them very strong instruction so we’ve temporarily waved all interest on federally held student loans."
2020-03-20,06:29,Donald Trump,"That’s a big thing. That’s going to make a lot of students very happy. And we have more to come on student loans. More good news for the students, but we’ll do that at a different time. This morning the Treasury Department also announced that we’re moving tax day from April 15th to July 15th. So we’re moving it out to July 15th so that people will have time and people will be able to, hopefully by that time we’ll have people getting back to their lives. Families and businesses will have this extra time to file with no interest or penalties. We’re getting rid of interest and penalties. However, if you have refunds or credits you’d like to claim, you may still file. In other words, you can file early if you are owed money by the IRS. Other than that, we’re moving it all the way out to July 15th. No interest, no penalties."
2020-03-20,07:23,Donald Trump,"Your new date will be July 15th. Today, our team will also provide an update on our continuing effort to prevent the transmission of virus across America’s borders. And I watched what’s been happening in California with Governor Newsome and this morning with Governor Cuomo, and I applaud them. They’re taking very strong bold steps and I applaud them. And we’re all working together. We’re working very closely together, including those two governors. But, I would say based on the call, the media was there. I think we can say that with respect to virtually every governor in that call, I think every governor, we had almost all of them, if not all of them. And I would say that you could see for yourselves that the level of respect and [inaudible 00:08:14] core working together was extraordinary. There was nobody angry, nobody upset. We’re able to help them and that’s what we’re all about."
2020-03-20,08:23,Donald Trump,"We want to help. We’re doing things that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do. But the relationship with governors in states is I think very extraordinary, especially under the circumstances where this just came upon us. We’re working with Canada and Mexico to prevent the spread of the virus across North America very closely. You heard what we did yesterday with Canada and Secretary of State Pompeo will be making a statement in a little while having to do with Mexico and the border. And Chad, likewise, Chad Wolf will likewise be making a statement. There’s a joint comprehensive effort in collaboration with our neighbors. The measure and all of those measures that we’re putting in place will protect the health of all three nations and reduce the incentive for a mass global migration that would badly deplete the healthcare resources needed for our people. And so we are working very closely with Mexico. Very, very closely with Canada and the relationship’s never been better."
2020-03-20,09:34,Donald Trump,"We’re all working for the same, toward the same goal. Our nation’s top healthcare officials are extremely concerned about the great public health consequences of mass, uncontrolled cross border movement. And that would be mostly, and even beyond, but mostly during this global pandemic. Every week our boarder agents encounter thousands of unscreened, unvetted and unauthorized entries from dozens of countries. And we’ve had this problem for decades. For decades. You know the story. But now it’s with the national emergencies and all of the other things that we’ve declared, we can actually do something about it. We’re taking a very strong hold of that. And we have before, but this is now at a level that nobody’s ever approached. In normal times these massive flows place a vast burden on our healthcare system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants, and to the public at large."
2020-03-20,10:41,Donald Trump,"Left unchecked, this would cripple our immigration system, overwhelm our healthcare system, and severely damage our national security. We’re not going to let that happen. So we have a lot of information and they’ll be discussing that in a moment. To confront these public health degrees, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has decided to exercise its authority under the Title 42 of the US Code to give customs and border protection the tools it needs to prevent the transmission of the virus coming through both the Northern and the Southern border. So we’re treating the borders equally. The Northern border and the Southern border. They’re both being treated equally. A lot of people say that they’re not treated equally. Well, they are. As we did with Canada, we’re also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel. These new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce."
2020-03-20,11:45,Donald Trump,"Furthermore, Mexico is taking action to secure our own Southern border and suspend air travel from Europe. So we’re coordinating very closely, the air travel going to Mexico and then trying to come into the United States. The actions we’re taking together with our North American partners will save countless lives. At the conclusion of my remarks, Secretary Azar, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Wolf, we’re going to be also taking some questions with Tony and Deborah, who you’ve gotten to know very well. But, there’ll be discussing certain things and I think you’ll find them of great interest. We’re going to be providing tremendous amounts of detail over the coming days, but a lot of it will be provided right now, if you’d like to find out about it. There’s been a week of resolute action, tremendous action, tremendous relationships have developed with people that frankly didn’t get along. People that didn’t like each other."
2020-03-20,12:49,Donald Trump,"They’re now working together and maybe even in some cases learning about each other and liking each other. It’s a nice thing. I invoked the Defense Production Act and last night we put it into gear. We moved the National Response Coordination Center to the highest level of activity. I mean, if you take a look at what we did, the level of activation has been increased to a grade one level, which is the highest level. We’re providing historic support to small businesses and to the states. The states need support. Normally, they’d this themselves, but because of the magnitude of it, the federal government has gotten very much involved in terms of getting the equipment they need. So we’re helping them. It’s a responsibility they have, but we are helping the states a lot. That’s why the governors, I think in every case, have been impressed and very nice."
2020-03-20,13:49,Donald Trump,"We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers. And I think it’s very important, so they get paid sick leave at no cost to employers. We’re accelerating the use of new drug treatments. We’re advancing legislation to give direct payments to hardworking families. Throughout our country Americans from all walks of life are rallying together to defeat the unseen enemy striking our nation. In times of struggle, we see the true greatness of the American character. And we are seeing that. A lot of people are talking about it. We’re at 141 countries from what they’re telling me, and some of those countries, they’re really working in a unified manner and they’re working very unified with us. Almost, I could say, a good number of them. Doctors and nurses are working nonstop to heal the sick citizens. And churches are delivering meals to the needy."
2020-03-20,14:48,Donald Trump,"Truckers are making the long haul to keep shelves stocked. We’ve been dealing with the big stores and the big chains, Walmart, they’ve been fantastic and others, they’ve all been fantastic. We’ve made it much easier for them to stock in terms of travel and travel restrictions. We’re lifting restrictions so they can get their trucks on time. You’re seeing very few empty shelves and yet the amount of volume that they’re doing is unprecedented because people want to have what they have to have, what they feel they have to have. And they’re also buying in slightly smaller quantities, which is good, because we’re not going anywhere. We’re going to be here. So I want to thank all of those very great companies for working so well. Americans from every walk of life are coming together and thanks to the spirit of our people, we will win this war and we are, we’re winning and we’re going to win this war."
2020-03-20,15:42,Donald Trump,"America will triumph. And America will rise higher than ever before. We’ll be stronger than ever before. And we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about relying on other countries. And I can say that I think in both a very good and a very bad way. Some good things came out of it and some not so good things came out of it. So I’d like to move now to invite our team to provide information on the new measures to prevent viral spread at our borders. And I’ll start by asking Secretary of State Pompeo to speak. He’s doing a fantastic job. And like everyone else, he’s been working very, very long and very, very hard, and he’s doing the other more normal jobs of a great Secretary of State. But, he got tied into this like everybody else and he’s been really doing a fantastic job. Mike, please."
2020-03-20,16:39,Mike Pompeo,"Thank you, Mr. President. Before I address the efforts that we’ve been engaged in to push back against the Chinese virus, I want to share the American people that as President Trump just said, your State Department, your entire National Security Team is staying focused on the other diplomatic challenges around the world. Those include reducing risk to America from Afghanistan, holding the Iranian regime accountable for its activity, and our counter terrorism efforts against ISIS remain a priority for our team. Our number one priority across those mission sets remains the protection of the American people. The President and our team are very focused on it. I want to take this moment to, to thank my team, State Department team who is working long hours all around the world to take care of Americans who are stuck at places around the world. I’ll talk about that more in just a minute. You’ve all seen Dr. Burks with me."
2020-03-20,17:27,Mike Pompeo,"State Department officials are doing great work, but I want to give a shout out to all of the State Department team here in Washington and around the world that are working over time to help us push back against this pandemic. Under the President’s leadership this week, we’ve taken two important steps. First, as President Trump announced on Wednesday, the United States and Canada jointly agreed to restrict all non-essential traffic across our border. This decision goes into effect tonight at midnight. The restrictions will be reviewed after 30 days and they exclude traffic and movement across the border for work or other essential reasons."
2020-03-20,18:00,Mike Pompeo,"We’re grateful to have such an outstanding friend to the North who is committed, as we are, to defeating this virus. I also want to announce today that the United States and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travel across our shared border. Both our countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus to ensure that commerce that supports our economy continues to keep flowing. Here too, the United States is glad to have a friend who’s working side-by-side us in the fight. Secretary Wolf, will talk a little bit more about the details of how we’re working alongside our partner in Mexico to keep our Southern border safe and secure as well. On another note, yesterday the State Department issued a level four global travel advisory. This means that all international travel from US citizens should be avoided. In countries where commercial departure options remain available, US citizens who reside in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States unless they’re prepared to remain abroad for an extended time."
2020-03-20,19:06,Mike Pompeo,"If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may well be severely disrupted. And finally, I want to talk about the dis-information that people are seeing both on Twitter, and around the world, some of it coming from governments, some of it coming from other individuals. Just urge everyone as they’re seeing information, information that at one time suggested somehow this virus emanated from the United States Army. This information about lock- downs that are taking place, every American, indeed, people all around the world should ensure that where they turn to for information is a reliable source and not a bad actor trying to create and flow information that they know is wrong."
2020-03-20,19:45,Mike Pompeo,This is a tough fight. The American people are tougher. Our diplomatic teams are working around the clock to help them keep safe both home and abroad. And we’re showing once again the global leadership that America has always delivered. It’s been great to see countries from around the world rally behind what President Trump and our team are doing. Thank you.
2020-03-20,20:04,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. And we’ll take questions right after this. Chad Wolf."
2020-03-20,20:08,Chad Wolf,"Right behind you. Let me start off by thanking the President and the Vice President for their continued leadership and commitment for protecting the American people during this crisis. Early on, the President again took unprecedented actions to restrict travel from areas affected with the coronavirus. And to date, DHS has screened over 200,000 individuals coming back from those affected countries. This has been an immense undertaking, but one that the men and women of DHS have successfully accomplished."
2020-03-20,20:37,Chad Wolf,"Today’s announcement is yet another example of the extraordinary steps the administration has taken to ensure the safety of the American public. Before I comment on the CDC order that I’m sure Secretary Azar will later elaborate on, let me first address the progress as Secretary Pompeo and others have made with our Canadian and Mexican partners regarding cross border travel. As we continue to evaluate common sense measures that reduce risk and prevent further spread, it only makes sense that we have looked at the measures that our neighbors to the North and South are undertaking."
2020-03-20,21:08,Chad Wolf,"And so we’ve been working closely with those partners since the earliest days of this virus and the outbreak. And again, as the President said earlier this week, and Secretary Pompeo, we’ve reached an agreement with both Canada and Mexico to limit non-essential travel across our land borders. Let me be clear that neither of these agreements with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce. Essential commercial activities will not be impacted."
2020-03-20,21:36,Chad Wolf,"We will continue to maintain a strong and secure economic supply chain across our borders. A few examples of essential travel include, but certainly are not limited to, individuals traveling for medical purposes, to attend educational institutions, for emergency response, public health services and individuals engaged in lawful cross border trade. As the Secretary said, the agreements with both Canada and Mexico will go into effect on Saturday, March 21st. Furthermore, we’re also working collaboratively with Canada and Mexico to take decisive joint action regarding individuals seeking entry between our ports of entry."
2020-03-20,22:14,Chad Wolf,"The CDC order directs the department to suspend the introduction of all individuals seeking to enter the US without proper travel documentation. That’s for both the Northern and Southern border. The CDC Director has determined that the introduction and spread of the coronavirus and the departments border patrol stations and detention facilities presents a serious danger to migrants, our frontline agents, and officers and the American people. So it’s important to note that the department currently apprehends foreign nationals from over 120 different countries around the world. The vast majority of those having coronavirus cases."
2020-03-20,22:52,Chad Wolf,"Many of these individuals arrive with little or no identity travel or medical documentation making public health risk determinations all but impossible. It’s also important to note that the outbreak on our Southern border would likely increase the strain on health systems in our border communities, taking away important and life saving resources from American citizens. Tonight, again at midnight, we will execute the CDC order by immediately returning individuals arriving without documentation to Canada, Mexico, as well as a number of other countries without delay."
2020-03-20,23:25,Chad Wolf,"So again, CVP is positioned to execute these measures as we continue to keep our borders secure and safe. Before I conclude, let me just a wrap up by thanking the brave men and women of DHS, specifically CVP, and across the government for the work that they do day in and day out to keep the American people safe from the coronavirus. The department has a number of frontline officers that have tested positive, as well as others who are self quarantining. And I am doing everything that I can to protect these patriots as they continue to defend our Homeland during this crisis. Thank you."
2020-03-20,24:00,Donald Trump,"Thank you. Thank very much, Chad. Thank you. Secretary."
2020-03-20,24:07,Alex Azar,"Today’s announcement is just the latest in a long line of bold, decisive actions the President has taken to protect Americans from the coronavirus spreading across our borders. In January, within two weeks of China’s notifying WHO about the virus, and with only 45 cases in China, we began screening travelers from Wuhan. Then over time as the outbreak evolved, the President restricted travel from China, Iran and Europe. Our health experts say that these measures have been truly effective at slowing the virus’ spread to our shores. Just think about this. Italy and the United States both saw their first travel related case of coronavirus around the exact same time the last week of January. And yet, we have had precious time to continue our work around vaccines, therapeutics, and other preparations, while Italy has tragically been overwhelmed with-"
2020-03-20,25:03,Alex Azar,"Italy has tragically been overwhelmed with critical patients for several weeks now. The president today is taking action to slow the spread of infectious disease via our border. Under Section 362 of the Public Health Service Act, the CDC is suspending the entry of certain persons into the United States because of the public health threat that their entry into the United States represents."
2020-03-20,25:25,Alex Azar,This order applies to persons coming from Mexico and Canada who are seeking to enter the country illegally and who would normally be held in a congregate setting like a customs and border protection station. It does not apply to US citizens or lawful permanent residents.
2020-03-20,25:43,Alex Azar,"During this pandemic, a number of health challenges arise when illegal immigrants arrive at our Northern and Southern borders and are taken into immigration custody. We’re talking about significant numbers of illegal immigrants. From this past October through February, DHS has processed more than 21,000 inadmissible aliens at the Northern border and more than 151,000 inadmissible aliens at the Southern border."
2020-03-20,26:12,Alex Azar,"CBP facilities were never designed to hold large numbers of people and to protect agents and migrants from infection during a pandemic, nor to treat them for a novel virus if large numbers are infected. When held at border facilities, these migrants risk spreading the virus to other migrants, to CBP agents and border health care workers, and even the United States population as a whole. In such circumstances, the kind of social distancing measures the CDC and the president have recommended are simply not possible."
2020-03-20,26:42,Alex Azar,"On top of that, any resources that we are using to reduce the risk of infection amongst CBP agents, healthcare workers, and migrants in these facilities are drawing on an American healthcare system that is already fighting the coronavirus pandemic. That’s why the president and his administration are taking these important steps to keep Americans and our immigration system safe from these health risks as part of our whole-of-government approach to combating the coronavirus. Thank you, Mr. President, for the work that you’ve been doing throughout this crisis to slow the spread of the coronavirus and to keep our country safe."
2020-03-20,27:18,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:27:22] Tony or Deb?
2020-03-20,27:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. President. We continue to review the data very carefully from around the globe, as I know many of you are. We continue to see signs that, again, individuals under 20, 19 and under, may have severe disease, but majority and all have recovered to date. We still see that same trend. Frankly, from Italy, we’re seeing another concerning trend that the mortality in males seems to be twice in every age group of females. This should alert all of us to continue our vigilance to protect our Americans that are in nursing homes. This requires all of the community. When you see the sacrifices that many Americans have made, the sacrifices that the service industry has made to close their restaurants, close their bars, and so that the spread is discontinued, then you really understand how all of Americans must make the same sacrifice."
2020-03-20,28:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We continue to ask you to follow the presidential guidelines of no groups coming together of more than 10. That if anyone in the household is sick, that everyone quarantines in the household together, and that we continue to focus on those who have the most vulnerability to this illness."
2020-03-20,28:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"To the moms and dads out there that have children with immunodeficiencies or other medical conditions, we don’t know the level of risk. I know you will also protect them in the same way. There just is not enough numbers at this time to really tell them if they’re at additional risk or not in the same way that adults are. I don’t have any new data. I can see the look on your face, saying, “Is she seeing something new?” I don’t have any new data, but I think it’s important for us to be as honest with the American people as we can, and, when we don’t have data, be very clear that we don’t know."
2020-03-20,29:21,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, no one is immune. I sometimes hear people on radio or others talking about, “I’m immune to the virus.” We don’t know if the contagion levels are different in age groups, but we know it’s highly contagious to everyone. Do not interpret mild or moderate disease as lack of contagion, or that you’re immune. You just happen to have a better immune system, and the ability to fight the virus in a way that maybe older people or people with existing medical conditions can’t."
2020-03-20,29:53,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That’s why it’s very important at this moment that all of you carry that message about the sacrifices that many have made, particularly our service providers and our frontline healthcare workers. They are making that sacrifice every day so that every American can move through this well. But, we need every American following the presidential guidelines. Thank you."
2020-03-20,30:17,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Tony? Good.
2020-03-20,30:18,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. I just want to underscore a couple of things that I’ve said a few times to this group. You may recall that, just a week ago or so, I said the two pillars, the two elements of our capability to contain the infection and the surge of infections in this country rely on two things."
2020-03-20,30:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Keeping infections from coming from without in. We’ve been very successful in doing that with China and with Europe. Now we have the northern and southern border issues. There is a fundamental public health reason for doing that, because we cannot be preventing people from coming in from one area when they can actually go into the other. That’s an important reason. Understand that. There’s a public health reason for doing that."
2020-03-20,31:04,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The second thing I think is really important is what happened in New York today. Governor Cuomo mentioned about an hour ago some rather strong issues that have been addressed with his recommendations, not recommendations, essentially orders. We have a group of recommendations and guidelines that are applicable to the entire country. You know them. We’d been over them. Yet there are places, regions, states, cities in this country that are being stressed much, much more than the country as a whole. Clearly one of them was Washington, another one was California. Governor Newsom made some very important, difficult decisions. Today, Governor Cuomo did the same thing. I want to say I strongly support what he’s doing."
2020-03-20,31:52,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"One thing, as a New Yorker myself, for those of you who haven’t figured out from my accent that I’m from New York, as a New Yorker, I know what New Yorkers can do. We’re tough. I was in New York City on September 11, 2001, and I know what the New Yorkers can do. Please cooperate with your governor. Cooperate with your mayor. It’s very important. Thank you."
2020-03-20,32:14,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Tony. Mike?"
2020-03-20,32:15,Mike Pence,That’s correct.
2020-03-20,32:19,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning, and we continue at the president’s direction to bring the full resources, not just of the federal government, but in full partnership with our state governments, businesses around America, and a partnership with the American people to respond to the threat of the coronavirus."
2020-03-20,32:40,Mike Pence,"I know I can speak on behalf of the president with confidence when I say how inspired we are by the way the American people and American businesses are coming together to help defeat this virus in our country. Millions of Americans are putting into practice the president’s 15-day guidelines, and we encourage everyone, even those that are not in areas with significant outbreak, to review these guidelines over the next week and more and put them into practice, and you’ll continue to do your part."
2020-03-20,33:15,Mike Pence,"Later today we’ll be talking with manufacturers around the country, and the president and I continue to be inspired by the way American industry is stepping forward. We have businesses around the country that are literally volunteering to retrofit plants to help us meet the needs of our healthcare workers and our healthcare system in confronting the coronavirus."
2020-03-20,33:36,Mike Pence,"As the president mentioned yesterday, following his decision to put FEMA in the lead, the emergency declaration, we actually met with all the nation’s governors from the FEMA National Response Coordination Center. The president and I, our entire team at the federal level, couldn’t be more grateful for the efforts of our governors in implementing the guidance that is being issued not only from our task force but also in taking strong measures in their own communities to protect their citizens. We want to urge every American to heed your local authorities, listen to their guidance, and also do your part to slow the spread."
2020-03-20,34:17,Mike Pence,"We reiterated to all of the governors that the president, by putting FEMA in the lead, will continue to implement a plan that is locally executed, state managed, and federally supported that puts the health of America first."
2020-03-20,34:32,Mike Pence,"We received a report today, as the president mentioned, on our legislative team on Capitol Hill. We’re working with Republicans and Democrats at this very hour to pass an economic recovery package that the president described. We hope to see the Congress act on that early next week."
2020-03-20,34:51,Mike Pence,"On the subject of supplies, we continue to make steady progress on testing. Thanks to the president’s involvement of commercial labs, the public and private partnership, more and more Americans are being tested every single day. Tomorrow, Admiral Giroir and FEMA will update the American public on the status of testing and our support of state-based testing efforts that are literally expanding by the hour."
2020-03-20,35:16,Mike Pence,"On the subject of medical supplies, we continue at the president’s direction to pursue every means to expand the supply of personal protective equipment for the extraordinary and courageous healthcare workers that are ministering to the needs of people impacted by the coronavirus. We have a policy of procuring, allocating, as well as conserving the resources that we have in our system."
2020-03-20,35:42,Mike Pence,"Now that the president worked with the Congress to make industrial masks fully available for hospitals to be able to purchase to be able to use as protective equipment, we’re more encouraged than ever about the availability of those important N95 masks to our healthcare facilities. Over this weekend we’ll be announcing a major procurement from the federal government of N95 masks as well."
2020-03-20,36:08,Mike Pence,"We’re also encouraged that we’re finding new alternatives to increase the supply of ventilators. We’ve mentioned that we have a federal stockpile, some 20,000 ventilators on standby, but that doesn’t count the tens of thousands of ventilators that are in our healthcare system around the country. The president has challenged us to work to free up other ventilators from other sources around the country. There are two different ways that we’re doing that."
2020-03-20,36:36,Mike Pence,"Number one, in our recent discussion with the anesthesiologists, we’ve literally identified tens of thousands of existing ventilators that can be retrofitted and converted to be ventilators for people struggling with the coronavirus. Also, on the president’s behalf and behalf of all of our task force, we want to continue to urge every American and every American hospital and healthcare facility to postpone any elective medical procedures. This will free up bed space, free up hospital capacity for people that are struggling with the coronavirus, and it’ll also free up equipment that our healthcare workers need."
2020-03-20,37:18,Mike Pence,"It is inspiring that we continue to receive reports as businesses around America are donating N95 masks to their local hospitals. Businesses large and small are donating hundreds, in some cases millions, of N95 masks. I know how grateful the president is, and we all are."
2020-03-20,37:36,Mike Pence,"Let me close by saying, as all of our experts have said many times, while the threat of serious illness to the average American from the coronavirus remains low, every American can do your part to reduce the burden on your health, on your family, the burden on our healthcare system, and especially the threat to the most vulnerable among us by putting into practice the president’s 15 days to slow the spread. As the president said at the outset of his remarks, I know that millions of Americans are doing that just now, and the greatness of the American character is shining for it."
2020-03-20,38:14,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you."
2020-03-20,38:19,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-03-20,38:19,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-03-20,38:20,Unnamed,You had a call with Senator Schumer. He says you’ve now agreed to invoke the Defense Production Act to actually make those medical supplies that hospitals say are in severe shortage. Two questions. Is that what you’re doing now?
2020-03-20,38:32,Donald Trump,"It is. I did it yesterday. We invoked it, I think, the day before. We signed it the evening of the day before, and voted yesterday. We have a lot of people working very hard to do ventilators and various other things, yes."
2020-03-20,38:45,Unnamed,"You’re using it now to tell businesses they need to make ventilators, mass respirators?"
2020-03-20,38:49,Donald Trump,"We are. For certain things that we need, including some of the very important emergency … I would say ventilators, probably more masks, to a large extent. We have millions of masks which are coming, and which will be distributed to the states. The states are having a hard time getting them, so we’re using the act. The act is very good for things like this. We have millions of masks that we’ve ordered. They will be here soon. We’re having them shipped directly to states."
2020-03-20,39:20,Unnamed,"You said you would only … You were signing this, but not invoking it. This is what you said yesterday, and that you would only do so in a worst-case scenario. Are we now at a worst-case scenario?"
2020-03-20,39:26,Donald Trump,"No, it’s no different other than we need certain equipment that the states are unable to get by themselves, so we’re invoking it to use the powers of the federal government to help the states get things that they need like the masks, like the ventilators. Yes, [Steve 00:14:42]?"
2020-03-20,39:42,Steven,"Given what Governor Cuomo has done in New York, is there any more consideration to a national lockdown to keep people in their homes?"
2020-03-20,39:50,Donald Trump,"I don’t think so. Essentially you’ve done that in California, you’ve done that in New York. Those are really two hotbeds. Those are probably the two hottest of them all in terms of hotspots. I don’t think so, because you go out to the Midwest, you go out to other locations, and they’re watching it on television, but they don’t have the same problems. They don’t have by any means the same problem."
2020-03-20,40:12,Donald Trump,"New York, California. Miami, the governor’s doing an excellent job, Governor DeSantis in Florida. We have some pretty hot spots in Florida too, and the state of Washington, of course. But that was largely, if you look at it, it was one nursing home that had problems like you wouldn’t believe."
2020-03-20,40:31,Donald Trump,"No, we’re working with the governors. I don’t think we’ll ever find that necessary."
2020-03-20,40:35,Steven,We’re about a week into your 15-day guidelines. Are you happy with the progress? Would you like to see the 15 days extended?
2020-03-20,40:41,Donald Trump,"I am happy. I am happy with it. We’ll have to see what the results are at the end of 14 days, let’s say. We’ll know by the 15th day, to see what we do."
2020-03-20,40:50,Donald Trump,"I’m certainly honored by the way the American people are working, because it’s work. It’s work not to work. This is the first time this has ever happened. We’re working on a tremendous financial package for them so they don’t work. Whoever heard of this? Usually you work out a financial package to get people working. We’re asking people not to work. Social distancing, that new term that’s become probably the hottest term there is. No, I’m very honored by the way the American people are are taking this so seriously. Yes, [Jim 00:00:41:23]?"
2020-03-20,41:25,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, a question for you and a question for Dr. Fauci, if I could."
2020-03-20,41:27,John (Reporter),There’s been some concern among Democrats on Capitol Hill that the phase three fiscal stimulus is weighted too much in favor of corporations and not enough in terms of individuals. What did your conversations with Senator Schumer yield on that front?
2020-03-20,41:39,Donald Trump,"I think that really all of that is being discussed right now. We talked about, as an example, stock buybacks. I don’t want to have stock buybacks. I don’t want some executive saying, “We’re going to buy 200,000 shares of stock.” I want that money to be used for the workers, and also for the company to keep the company going, but not for buybacks. I haven’t spoken to a lot of the Republicans or Democrats on it. We discussed it. I don’t like buybacks. I didn’t like them the first time."
2020-03-20,42:10,John (Reporter),Are you and Senator Schumer-
2020-03-20,42:12,Donald Trump,We’re discussing that. We’re discussing many things.
2020-03-20,42:14,John (Reporter),Are you on same page with Senator Schumer?
2020-03-20,42:16,Donald Trump,"We’re not so far away. I’ll tell you, we’re not very far away."
2020-03-20,42:19,John (Reporter),"To Dr. Fauci, if I could? Dr. Fauci, as was explained yesterday, there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. Is there any evidence to suggest that, as with malaria, it might be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19?"
2020-03-20,42:36,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No. The answer is no. The evidence that you’re talking about is anecdotal evidence. As the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we’re trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it’s truly safe and truly effective. But, the information that you’re referring to specifically is anecdotal. It was not done in a controlled clinical trial, so you really can’t make any definitive statement about it."
2020-03-20,43:11,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-03-20,43:11,Unnamed,"Mr. President, on that thought …"
2020-03-20,43:11,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-03-20,43:13,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-03-20,43:15,Unnamed,On those therapies-
2020-03-20,43:18,Donald Trump,"I think, without seeing too much, I’m probably more of a fan of that, maybe, than anybody. I’m a big fan, and we’ll see what happens. We all understand what the doctor said is 100% correct. It’s early, but I’ve seen things that are impressive. We’ll see. We’re going to know soon. We’re going to know soon. Including safety. When you get that safety, this has been prescribed for many years for people to combat malaria, which was a big problem, and it’s very effective. It’s a strong drug."
2020-03-20,43:55,John (Reporter),It was also apparently effective against SARS.
2020-03-20,43:56,Donald Trump,"It was, as I understand that … Is that a correct statement? It was fairly effective on SARS?"
2020-03-20,44:02,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"John, you’ve got to be careful when you say “fairly effective”. It was never done in a clinical trial, they compared it to anything. It was given to individuals, and felt that maybe it worked."
2020-03-20,44:11,John (Reporter),Was there anything to compare it to?
2020-03-20,44:13,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That’s the point. Whenever you do a clinical trial, you do standard of care versus standard of care plus the agent you’re evaluating. That’s the reason why we showed, back in Ebola, why particular interventions worked."
2020-03-20,44:28,Unnamed,"Sir, on that topic-"
2020-03-20,44:28,Peter (Reporter),Mr. President?
2020-03-20,44:28,Unnamed,"Sir, on masks-"
2020-03-20,44:31,Peter (Reporter),"About the possible therapies, yesterday, Mr. President, you said that they were for “immediate delivery”. Immediate. We heard from-"
2020-03-20,44:37,Donald Trump,"We were ordering … Yes, we have millions of units ordered. Bayer is one of the companies, as you know, big company, very big, very great company. Millions of units are ordered. We’re going to see what happens."
2020-03-20,44:51,Donald Trump,"We’re going to be talking to the governors about it, and the FDA is working on it right now. The advantage is that it has been prescribed for a totally different problem, but it has been described for many years. Everybody knows the levels of the negatives and the positives. But, I will say that I am a man that comes from a very positive school when it comes to, in particular, one of these drugs."
2020-03-20,45:17,Donald Trump,"We’ll see how it works out, [Peter 00:00:45:18]. I’m not saying it will, but I think that people may be surprised. By the way, that would be a game changer. We’re going to know very soon. We have ordered millions of units. It’s being ordered from Bayer, and there is another couple of companies also that do it."
2020-03-20,45:35,Peter (Reporter),"For clarity, Dr. Fauci said there is no magic drug for coronavirus right now, which you would agree. I guess on this issue [crosstalk 00:45:41]-"
2020-03-20,45:42,Donald Trump,I think we only disagree a little bit.
2020-03-20,45:44,Peter (Reporter),Sorry.
2020-03-20,45:44,Donald Trump,"I disagree. Maybe and maybe not. Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. We have to see. We’re going to known soon."
2020-03-20,45:52,Peter (Reporter),Is it possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope and misrepresenting our preparedness right now?
2020-03-20,45:57,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t think so. I think got-"
2020-03-20,46:01,Peter (Reporter),[crosstalk 00:46:01] the not-yet-approved drug-
2020-03-20,46:05,Donald Trump,"Such a lovely question. Look, it may work, and it may not work. I agree with the doctor, what he said. May work, may not work. I feel good about it. That’s all it is. Just a feeling. I’m a smart guy. I feel good about it. We’re going to see."
2020-03-20,46:21,Donald Trump,"You’re going to see soon enough. We have certainly some very big samples of people. If you look at the people, you have a lot of people that are in big trouble. This is not a drug that, obviously, I think I can speak from a lot of experience, because it’s been out there for over 20 years. It’s not a drug that you have a huge amount of danger with. It’s not a brand-new drug that’s been just created, that may have an unbelievable monumental effect like kill you. We’re going to know very soon."
2020-03-20,46:51,Donald Trump,"I can tell you, the FDA’s working very hard to get it out. Right now, in terms of malaria, if you want it, you can have a prescription. You get a prescription. By the way, and it’s very effective. It works."
2020-03-20,47:03,Donald Trump,"I have a feeling you may … I’m not being overly optimistic or pessimistic. I sure as hell think we ought to give it a try. There’s been some interesting things happened, and some very good things. Let’s see what happens. We have nothing to lose. You know the expression? What the hell do you have to lose?"
2020-03-20,47:22,Peter (Reporter),What do you say to [crosstalk 00:47:22]-
2020-03-20,47:26,Donald Trump,"John, go ahead."
2020-03-20,47:26,Peter (Reporter),"What do you say to Americans who are scared, though? Nearly 200 dead. 14,000 who are sick. Millions, as you witness, who are scared right now. What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?"
2020-03-20,47:38,Donald Trump,"I say that you’re a terrible reporter. That’s what I say. I think it’s a very nasty question, and I think it’s a very bad signal that you’re putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers and they’re looking for hope, and you’re doing sensationalism. The same with NBC and Comcast. I don’t call it Comcast, I called Concast, for who you work."
2020-03-20,48:01,Donald Trump,"Let me just tell you something. That’s really bad reporting, and you ought to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism. Let’s see if it works. It might and it might not. I happen to feel good about it, but who knows? I’ve been right a lot. Let’s see what happens."
2020-03-20,48:18,Donald Trump,John?
2020-03-20,48:19,John (Reporter),Want to get back to the science and the logistics here-
2020-03-20,48:21,Donald Trump,You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
2020-03-20,48:21,John (Reporter),"The units that were ordered, are they for clinical trials? Are they for distribution to the general patient population?"
2020-03-20,48:27,Unnamed,"As I understand it, we are going to be taking samples in New York. Governor Cuomo very much is interested in this drug, and they are going to work on it also after they get a certain approval. We’re waiting for one final approval from the FDA. We’ll see what happens, but we’ll use it on people that are not doing great or even at the beginning of not feeling well."
2020-03-20,48:49,John (Reporter),This would fall under the modified hospice-
2020-03-20,48:50,Unnamed,"John, what do we have to lose?"
2020-03-20,48:52,John (Reporter),This would-
2020-03-20,48:53,Unnamed,"John, it’s been out there for so long. We hear good things. Let’s see. Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn’t."
2020-03-20,49:01,John (Reporter),I understand all that. I’m just thinking the application here. That would be under a modified compassionate access?
2020-03-20,49:03,Unnamed,"We’re doing that, I guess. That’s what it’s called, yeah. Yes?"
2020-03-20,49:07,Unnamed,"I would like, Dr. Fauci, if you don’t mind, to follow up on what the president is saying. Should Americans have hope in this drug right now? Sir, I would like to follow up on Peter’s question, here. Could you please address Americans in this country who are scared right now? This is a very valid concern that people have."
2020-03-20,49:24,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"There really isn’t that much of a difference in many respects with what we’re saying. The president feels optimistic about something, his feeling about it. What I’m saying is that it might be effective. I’m not saying that it isn’t. It might be effective."
2020-03-20,49:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"But, as a scientist, as we’re getting it out there, we need to do it in a way as, while we are making it available for people who might want the hope that it might work, you’re also collecting data that will ultimately show that it is truly effective and safe under the conditions of COVID-19. It really isn’t different. It’s just a question of how one feels about it."
2020-03-20,50:01,John (Reporter),Is there any reason to believe it’s not safe?
2020-03-20,50:03,Dr. Anthony Fauci,How one feels about it.
2020-03-20,50:03,John (Reporter),Is there any reason to believe it’s not safe?
2020-03-20,50:04,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, certainly as a drug, any drug, John has some toxicities. The decades of experience that we have with this drug indicate that the toxicities are rare and they are in many respects reversible. What we don’t know is when you put it in the context of another disease, whether it’s safe. Fundamentally I think it probably is going to be safe, but I like to prove things first. So it really is a question of not a lot of difference. It’s the hope that it will work versus proving that it will work. So I don’t see big differences here."
2020-03-20,50:36,Donald Trump,I agree.
2020-03-20,50:37,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:50:37]. Parents who are working at home who have their children in their homes right now, who are homeschooling, doctors who say they don’t have the masks they need to do their jobs. Your message to them."
2020-03-20,50:48,Donald Trump,"My message to the American people is that there is a very low incidence of death. You understand that and we’re going to come through this stronger than ever before. If you get it, if you happen to get it, it is highly unlikely. It’s looking like it’s getting to a number. That’s much smaller than people originally thought in terms of the ultimate problem, which would be death. My message to the American people is, number one, you’ve done an incredible job, incredible what you’ve gone through. It wasn’t their fault. It wasn’t the fault of 140 other countries where this has happened and there is tremendous hope and I think we’re going to come out stronger, better, bigger in every way."
2020-03-20,51:35,Donald Trump,"I think we’re going to be a better country than we were before. And we learned a lot. We learned on reliance who to rely on who not to rely on. Our country has been incredible the way they pulled together, including the fact that I just spoke to Senator Schumer. We had a wonderful conversation. We both want to get to a good solution, but it’s been a really, for me, watching and seeing people that weren’t speaking, getting along well because we all have one common aim and that’s to get rid of this invisible enemy. Get rid of it fast, and then go back to the kind of economy that we had. And maybe even better. Yeah, please in the back. No, the back, please."
2020-03-20,52:16,Unnamed,"Mr. President, two questions. The first question is many small businesses are concerned that they have weeks, not months, and are worried about how long it will take them-"
2020-03-20,52:25,Donald Trump,"We’re going to be helping them a lot. We’re going to be focused, a big focus and including my conversation with both Mitch and with Chuck, a big focus of that conversation with small businesses, because they are really the engine behind our country more so than the big ones. They are the engine behind our country."
2020-03-20,52:42,Unnamed,"Second, if I may sir, are you concerned about members of Congress that may have used information they learned on updates to sell stocks and profit off of this?"
2020-03-20,52:49,Donald Trump,"I’m not aware of it, I saw some names. I know all of them. I know everyone mentioned Dianne Feinstein, I guess, and a couple of others. I don’t know too much about what it’s about, but I find them to all be very honorable people. That’s all I know. And they said they did nothing wrong. I find them the whole group. Very honorable people. Yeah, please."
2020-03-20,53:12,Unnamed,"Mr. President, so the whole group would include Richard Burr, the head of the intelligence committee, and it also would include Senator Kelly Loeffler . And so the question is whether or not they should be investigated for that behavior-"
2020-03-20,53:24,Donald Trump,"Well, it also includes Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. You didn’t mention her name. What didn’t you mention her name? And I think she’s a very honorable person by the way. So I’m not saying, but you know, it’s interesting that you mentioned two people, but you don’t mention one that happens to be a Democrat."
2020-03-20,53:38,Unnamed,"Any Senator, should they be-"
2020-03-20,53:40,Donald Trump,"I don’t know, because I’d have to look at it possibly, but I find them to be honorable people. Yeah."
2020-03-20,53:46,Unnamed,"You said the other day you see yourself as a wartime President right now leading the country through this pandemic that we’re experiencing. Do you really think going off on Peter, going off on a network is appropriate when the country’s going through something like that?"
2020-03-20,53:59,Donald Trump,"I do. Because I think Peter is, I’ve dealt with Peter for a long time and I think Peter is a not a good journalist when it comes to fairness."
2020-03-20,54:11,Unnamed,But he’s asking for your message to the country.
2020-03-20,54:13,Donald Trump,"I think it’s a good message because I think that the country has to understand that there is indeed whether we like it or not, and some of the people in this room won’t like it. There’s a lot of really great news and great journalism and there’s a lot of fake news out there and I hear it all and I see it all and I understand it all because I’m in the midst of it. So when somebody writes a story, or does a story on television, and I know it’s false, I know it’s fake. And when they say they have 15 sources have said, and I know there’s no sources, there’s no sources, they’re just making it up. I know that. And I call Peter out, but I call other people out too. And you know, this is a time to come together, but coming together is much harder when we have dishonest journalists. It’s a very important profession that you’re in. It’s a profession that I think is incredible. I cherish it, but when people are dishonest, they truly do hurt our country. Yeah. In the back. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-20,55:09,Unnamed,"China has been in communication with the United States and also WHO about Coronavirus and the US shuttered its border to travelers from China on February the second. Also, Wuhan has been in lock down since January the 24th and this all happened almost two months ago. Why did you say if you could have known it earlier and also you have been calling Coronavirus-"
2020-03-20,55:37,Donald Trump,"Well, I have to say this, we have, and I can speak for myself, but I have a very good relationship with China and with President Xi. I have great respect for President Xi, I consider him to be a friend of mine. It’s unfortunate that this got out of control. It came from China, it got out of control. Some people are upset. I know President Xi, he loves China. He respects the United States and I have to say I respect China greatly and I respect President Xi."
2020-03-20,56:07,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:06:12]. Talk more about the stock buy backs. Many of the airlines, and Boeing did stock buy backs if this a deal breaker for you in this-"
2020-03-20,56:18,Donald Trump,"No, I never liked stock buybacks from their standpoint. When we did a big tax cut and when they took the money and did buybacks, that’s not building a hangar. That’s not buying aircraft. That’s not doing the kind of things that I want them to do. And we’re now talking about buybacks. We didn’t think we would have had to restrict it because we thought they would have known better but they didn’t know better. And some cases, not in all cases, obviously some people did an incredible job. They built plants all over the country. I mean you’d see what’s happened."
2020-03-20,56:50,Donald Trump,"Until this invisible enemy appeared. I mean we never had an economy like this, but there were some companies that use that money to buy back stock, driving up the price of the stock artificially in many cases. I don’t like that. I don’t like it. And as far as whether or not we’ll have that allow them when we give them money because we have to keep these great companies in business because of the workers. Frankly, for the most part because of the workers, the workers are my number one concern. But the way we take care of the workers is we have to keep the companies going. I am fine with restricting buybacks. In fact, I would demand that there’d be no stock buybacks. I don’t want them taking hundreds of millions of dollars and buying back their stock because that does nothing. Yeah, please."
2020-03-20,57:37,Unnamed,"Thank you, very much. One for Dr. Fauci and hopefully one for you."
2020-03-20,57:40,Donald Trump,"Sure, and one thing, Secretary of State Pompeo is extremely busy. So if you have any question for him right now, could you do that? Because you know what I’d like to do? I’d like to him to go back to the state department or as they call it, the deep state department. You know, Mike. I’d like to have him go back and do his job. So does anybody have any question? Please."
2020-03-20,58:02,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:58:02] Yeah, how about you? Only for the secretary."
2020-03-20,58:07,Unnamed,"The extensions on work travel. Can you define that? Is all work trip, anyone with a work visa can still cross the border? Can you define the measures that you’re taking?"
2020-03-20,58:16,Mike Pompeo,"That’s a great question. We’re working with very real concern about H2A visas in particular agriculture workers need to get across. We’re going to make sure that we do everything we can to keep that part of our economic lifeblood working between our two countries. DHS and the state department will work together. We want to make sure and keep commerce between Canada, United States and Mexico alive, functional and prepared for the day that this economy bounces back like we expected that it will."
2020-03-20,58:45,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:58:45]. Mr. Secretary, the Mexican government has not announced any travel ban on Europe. Have you been in touch with them as to when they’re going to do this and what it is that telling you? And then a second question, they also are telling us and said in a press conference this morning that they will not take back any non Mexican citizen. Any other third parties will have to. We don’t know what will happen to them. So can you address what will happen to those third country immigrants that you are saying that will not be allowed to enter the US and Mexico saying that they will not be allowed to stay in Mexico, either or sent back from the US?"
2020-03-20,59:21,Mike Pompeo,"I’ll take the first one and then Chad, I’ll give you the second one. With respect to travel into Mexico from my side, I spoke with Foreign Minister Ebrard a couple of times about this. I’m very confident we’re going to get to a really good place to protect the Mexican people and the American people from those who might be traveling into places where we’ve got a designation, the [foreign language 00:09:38] zone from China so that they’re not coming into Mexico and then coming into the United States. I’m very confident we’ll do that and we’ll make that announcement shortly together."
2020-03-20,59:45,Chad Wolf,"Thank you, as we implement the CDC’s order again, we’re going to take a number of individuals that crossed the border illegally and repatriate them or remove them quickly back to Mexico, back to the Northern triangle and back to any other countries. So we’re going to do that in a rapid fashion. We’ll continue to work with Mexico to make sure the Mexican nationals go back as well as other populations."
2020-03-20,01:00:07,Unnamed,But are you sending Guatemalans back to Guatemala? Cubans back to Cuba. What would you do with those third countries that are not Mexicans?
2020-03-20,01:00:13,Chad Wolf,"So we’re doing all of the above. We’re going to be sending individuals back to Mexico, individuals back to the Northern triangle countries, Cuba, Haiti, we again 122 different nations that we see nationalities that come across that border. We’ll be sending them back individually to their countries, but also with working with Mexico to send additional populations back there as well."
2020-03-20,01:00:34,Donald Trump,"Just to put it, you know when you said before you said the non Mexicans going to Mexico, we’re not sending them to Mexico, we’re sending them back to their own country. It’s not to Mexico. Why would Mexico take people that aren’t from Mexico? We’re sending them back, in the case of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, lot of other countries, they go back to the country from where they came. Okay. Mike, please."
2020-03-20,01:00:57,Unnamed,"Secretary Pompeo, on the issue of disinformation. Is there any particular locusts for this disinformation or is it diffused?"
2020-03-20,01:01:04,Mike Pompeo,"It’s pretty diffused, unfortunately, but we’ve certainly seen it come from places like China and Russia and Iran where there are coordinated efforts to disparage what America is doing and in our activity to have to do all the things that President Trump has set in motion here."
2020-03-20,01:01:19,Unnamed,"Other than what you’re doing this morning, what are you doing to fight back?"
2020-03-20,01:01:21,Mike Pompeo,"Lot of things. Lots of work. One of the things want to make sure the American people go to trusted sources for the information, but we’ve made clear, we’ve spoken to these countries directly that they need to knock it off, that we don’t approve of it, and then there are a handful of other things we’re engaged in to make sure that the right information is out there and accurate information is given. This idea of transparency and accurate information is very important. It’s how we protect American people from something like this ever happening again."
2020-03-20,01:01:48,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:01:48] You say you want the American people to be coming to trusted sources of information. Does it undermine you at all when the President stands up here and he attacks news outlets calling us untrustworthy?
2020-03-20,01:01:59,Mike Pompeo,Does anyone else have a question?
2020-03-20,01:01:59,Unnamed,Mr. Secretary Peace Corps [crosstalk 01:02:01] volunteers have all-
2020-03-20,01:02:01,Unnamed,In terms of Americans who find themselves stranded in places where there are no longer flights to get back to the United States. What efforts are being made to help them?
2020-03-20,01:02:11,Mike Pompeo,"I appreciate that question. So we’re doing lots of things. We’ve had a couple of places in particular Peru and Morocco. I think we’ve had the first two, maybe three now flights out of Morocco. We’re going to work to get people back. We’re urging individuals when they can get back on their own, they traveled there on their own. When they can get back there on their own, they ought to try to do that. But we have a team stood up at the state department, the repatriation task force that is working each of these instances. So we’ve heard from individuals, members of Congress, we’re trying to get Americans back from these places where air travel has been disrupted and we’ll get that done over time. We’ll get it done successfully."
2020-03-20,01:02:45,Unnamed,Do you have any sense of how big that problem is?
2020-03-20,01:02:46,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, finish up."
2020-03-20,01:02:47,Unnamed,Is there any sense of just how big that problem is-
2020-03-20,01:02:50,Mike Pompeo,"We don’t know the full scale of it yet, but we think we have the largest number identified and we’re working, those who are watching that are someplace and you can get up and go on to state department website, you can log in to, I think step.gov and go step and login and we’ll track it and we’ll try to get everybody back as fast as we can."
2020-03-20,01:03:08,Unnamed,How long are these border restrictions likely to last along the South and North borders?
2020-03-20,01:03:13,Mike Pompeo,"Well, they’ll last as long as we need to do it to protect the American people from the virus. I couldn’t tell you how long it’s going to last."
2020-03-20,01:03:18,Unnamed,"We have you, have you determined whether Iran is responsible for that rocket attack last week?"
2020-03-20,01:03:25,Donald Trump,Maybe we shouldn’t say that.
2020-03-20,01:03:27,Mike Pompeo,So let me just get back to you on the answer to that and what-
2020-03-20,01:03:30,Donald Trump,We know plenty.
2020-03-20,01:03:30,Mike Pompeo,"What we can say with certainty is, we’ve made clear all along that the Iraqi Shia militias are funded, trained, equipped by the Iranians and we’ve urged the Iranians not to do that and we’ve told the Iranians that they will be held responsible for those attacks when they threaten American lives."
2020-03-20,01:03:49,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:03:49] The Peace Corps volunteers that are in 60 plus countries, have they all been returned?"
2020-03-20,01:03:53,Mike Pompeo,"You know, I don’t know if they’re all back or not yet. I know that they were directed to come back. I know that most of them are back. I couldn’t tell you if we have all of them back yet. I don’t know."
2020-03-20,01:04:01,Unnamed,"Secretary Esper is not here, but to get the test to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Are you able to give us a progress report on the status of that if they’re all able to get tests?"
2020-03-20,01:04:09,Mike Pompeo,"I don’t know the answer to that. I know we have state department officials too who are concerned and want to make sure we get them tests, our team as well and we’re working on that. We’ve had a significant success on that to date. There are a few places we’ve not been able to get them, but we will. We’ll get them there."
2020-03-20,01:04:21,Unnamed,"Secretary Pompeo, how exactly are you going to get those Americans back and do you have any plans to get the military involved in that?"
2020-03-20,01:04:27,Mike Pompeo,"We’re going to use all the tools we can. These first efforts are combined commercial private flights that will fly in, bring them back, bring them back to a destination here in the United States, so we’ll do that. There are some that will travel back other ways as well and we’ve worked with the department of defense to say where there are space available. We’ll be able to bring them back on those flights as well. That’s all government effort to make sure we get them back. They’re going to help us every place they can. Secretary [inaudible 01:04:51] talked about it a couple of times."
2020-03-20,01:04:52,Unnamed,"Secretary, question on Iran again, is there any considerations to relax some sanctions in Iran during the Coronavirus crisis [inaudible 01:05:01] hard hit."
2020-03-20,01:05:01,Mike Pompeo,That’s an important question. The the whole world should know that humanitarian assistance into Iran is wide open. It’s not sanctioned. We offered to provide assistance to the Iranians as well. I talked with Dr. Tedros from the world health organization about this. We’re doing everything we can to facilitate both the humanitarian assistance moving in and to make sure the financial transactions connected to that can take place as well. There is no sanction on medicine’s going to Iran. There’s no sanctions on humanitarian assistance going into that country. They’ve got a terrible problem there and we want that humanitarian medical healthcare assistance to get to the people of Iran.
2020-03-20,01:05:34,Unnamed,"But the sanctions themselves, no number?"
2020-03-20,01:05:38,Mike Pompeo,We are working to do all the things we’ve had in place for the first three years here to deliver security for the American people.
2020-03-20,01:05:47,Donald Trump,"They know the answer, they know the answer. Iran, the leaders. They know the answer to your question."
2020-03-20,01:05:51,Unnamed,Was it appropriate for the President to call your department a deep state department. At a time when thousands of diplomats are working very hard around the world to combat this pandemic?
2020-03-20,01:06:01,Mike Pompeo,"Worked with the President for three years now. I know how much he values the people that work on my team. I know when I was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, how much he valued the work we did. I know that he watches our team, Dr. Burke’s, all the team that’s working to push back against this virus to keep America safe. I know how much he values them."
2020-03-20,01:06:19,Donald Trump,"What a good answer. Yes, go ahead. Very true, too."
2020-03-20,01:06:25,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:06:25] I have two questions. The first is to Secretary Pompeo, the News Hours has learned that the CDC picked up, that there was some sort of virus happening in Wuhan, the Coronavirus happening in Wuhan as early as December. When did the CDC start letting other agencies know that there was something in China happening, that this Coronavirus was happening and then when did the whole government approach start to happen?"
2020-03-20,01:06:52,Mike Pompeo,"So I’ll let the CDC or Dr. Fauci, you want to talk [crosstalk 01:06:57] please."
2020-03-20,01:06:57,Unnamed,"Yeah, so we were alerted by some discussions that Dr. Redfield, the director of the CDC had with Chinese colleagues on January 3rd. It’s since been known that there may have been cases in December. Not that we were alerted in December."
2020-03-20,01:07:13,Unnamed,"Mr. President, the other question I have for you, when-"
2020-03-20,01:07:15,Donald Trump,"Excuse me, we’ll do that in a second. Let Mike-"
2020-03-20,01:07:18,Mike Pompeo,"May I just say one more thing. There’s been some discussion about China and what they knew and when they knew it, and I’ve been very critical. We need to know immediately the world is entitled to know. The Chinese government was the first to know of this risk to the world and that puts a special obligation to make sure that data, the data gets to our scientists, our professionals. This is not about retribution. This matters going forward. We’re in a live exercise here. To get this right. We need to make sure that even today the datasets that are available to every country, including datasets that are available to the Chinese communist party are made available to the whole world. It’s an imperative to keep people safe. We talk about the absence of datasets, not being able to make judgments about what to do."
2020-03-20,01:08:02,Mike Pompeo,"This is absolutely, this transparency, this realtime information sharing isn’t about political games or retribution. It’s about keeping people safe. And so when you see a delay in information flowing from the Chinese communist party to the technical people who we wanted to get into China immediately to assist in this, every moment of delay connected to being able to identify this risk vectors, creates risks to the people all around the world. And so this is why it’s not about blaming someone for this. This is about moving forward to make sure that we continue to have the information we need to do our jobs."
2020-03-20,01:08:37,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, what message do you think it sends to other countries when you have the President of the United States lashing out at reporters?"
2020-03-20,01:08:45,Mike Pompeo,I’ve had my frustration with reporters too. All I ask when I talk to the media is that you listen to what we say and report it accurately and it’s frustrating. It’s frustrating when you see that that doesn’t happen. It’s enormously frustrating. We have a responsibility to tell the American people the truth and those who are reporting on what it is we’re doing and saying have an equal responsibility to report accurately.
2020-03-20,01:09:06,Unnamed,What message does it send to countries when you’re lashing out at reporters? [crosstalk 01:09:12]
2020-03-20,01:09:12,Mike Pompeo,"I’ve seen many things at the state department be reported wildly inaccurately on multiple occasions, and I have spoken to those reporters about it each and every time, and I will continue to do so."
2020-03-20,01:09:23,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Senator Johnson has suggested-"
2020-03-20,01:09:26,Donald Trump,"I’ll rather have, if you could finish up with the Secretary of State-"
2020-03-20,01:09:30,Mike Pompeo,"I think I wore them out, Mr. President."
2020-03-20,01:09:30,Donald Trump,Is everybody finished with the Secretary of State?
2020-03-20,01:09:32,Unnamed,"Let me ask you both, if that’s all right. Mr. Secretary, Senator Johnson has suggested that you and the administration may be overreacting. He said, “We don’t shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways. We don’t shut down our economies because tens of thousands of people die from the common flu. At worst, 3.4% of Americans will die from this virus.” He said, what do you say to people that have that view? That’s 11 million people he’s talking about."
2020-03-20,01:10:02,Donald Trump,"Well I can just say, the entire world is agreeing with us because, they all have their choice and everybody’s doing the exact same thing. We want to shut it out and we can do that and we’ll see what happens in two weeks and three weeks. But if we can save thousands of lives and even millions of lives potentially, you don’t know where it goes, but you could be talking about millions of lives. So if you look at the the world, I mean you have some very smart people in the world. You have some smart leaders in the world and everybody’s doing it the way we’re doing it. I think we’re doing a better job than hopefully most, if not all, we’re doing a very effective job, but we’ll know better in 14 or 15 days. But you know, you’re talking about hundreds of thousands and maybe more than that numbers of people and you know, we can bring our finances back very quickly. We can’t bring the people back."
2020-03-20,01:10:52,Unnamed,"Mr. President is to follow up on that. There are millions of people out there that share that view that say, I don’t really need to shut things down. I don’t really need to stay away from the stores. I can go to the beach. And those people making multiple actions exponentially. It’s the difference between life and death-"
2020-03-20,01:11:14,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I agree with it, but I think I’d like to have Anthony answer that because to be honest, that’s what he does and we had a lot of very talented people telling us what they think we should do."
2020-03-20,01:11:27,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I think that’s a false equivalency to compare traffic accidents with, I mean that’s totally way out. That’s really a false equivalency. When you have something that is new and it’s emerging and you really can’t predict totally the impact it’s going to have and you take a look at what’s going on in China and you see what’s going on right now, right now in Italy and what’s happening in New York City. I don’t think with any moral conscience you could say, why don’t we just let it rip and happen and let X percent of the people die. I don’t understand that reasoning at all. [crosstalk 01:12:09]"
2020-03-20,01:12:09,Donald Trump,"Secretary of State will be leaving. Any other questions? Go ahead in the back, please. In the back, for Mike. [crosstalk 01:12:17] Excuse me, I didn’t call on you. Go ahead, please."
2020-03-20,01:12:18,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President. Two things, in New York where cases are doubling every day. They fear that supplies are going to run out in a matter of weeks. Yesterday Mayor Bill De Blasio called on you to mobilize the military to deliver urgent supplies. Yesterday he said quote, “The fate of New York City rests in the hands of one man. He is a New Yorker and right now he is betraying the city comes from.” I’ve personally spoken to emergency department nurses who say that there’ve been told not to wear N95 masks because supplies are so low. So how do you respond to those remarks by Mayor De Blasio-"
2020-03-20,01:12:54,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:12:54] I’m not dealing with him, I’m dealing with the governor and the governor agrees with me and I agree with him. So far we’ve been very much in sync. I guess they’re not agreeing with each other necessarily, but the relationship with New York, I love New York. I grew up in New York as you probably have heard and the relationship’s been very good and I think government and the governor have been getting along incredibly well with the federal government. Okay."
2020-03-20,01:13:21,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:23:29]. Question for Secretary Wolf, if I could. Just on illegal entries of people who are OTM, how will the turn back process work? Will they be taken to a common area and then put on a plane and sent back to Northern triangle countries or others? I mean how would that process work?"
2020-03-20,01:13:45,Chad Wolf,"Again, it’s a public health crisis, so what we’re trying to do is limit the amount of contact that we have with these individuals, not putting them in border patrol facilities, ICE detention facilities in the like. So it’s going to be very rapid. We’re going to obviously take them into custody and then send them back to a port of entry or other means. So it will be very quickly, it won’t be the six or seven or 10 days that we currently have. It’ll be a much more rapid."
2020-03-20,01:14:10,Unnamed,"But if they are OTM, will they be taken to an airfield that’s-"
2020-03-20,01:14:12,Chad Wolf,That’s correct. [crosstalk 00:24:17].
2020-03-20,01:14:14,Donald Trump,Anybody?
2020-03-20,01:14:17,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:14:22]. The checks to Americans. The bill is proposed creates sort of tiers of checks for incomes. Do you believe philosophically that makes sense?
2020-03-20,01:14:28,Donald Trump,"Well, I believe in a lot of things. I want to get workers money and whichever way, the best way to get it, and I want to keep the businesses open too, because without the businesses, they’re not going to be getting money for very long. [crosstalk 01:14:42]. If there’s not, we’ll do something later I’m sure."
2020-03-20,01:14:50,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:14:50] Wall Street analysts are predicting that unemployment numbers can skyrocket next week by some analysts say as many as 3 million people applying for unemployment, which would be a historic number of one week spread. So is $1,000 check going to cut it? Is that going to be."
2020-03-20,01:15:03,Unnamed,"One week spread, so is $1,000 check going to cut it? Is that going to be?"
2020-03-20,01:15:04,Donald Trump,"We’re not talking about $1,000 check. We’re talking about much more than that. We’re also talking about doing phases. If this doesn’t work, we’re going to keep doing until we get it going and frankly, once we get the economy back and once this enemy is defeated, the invisible enemy as I call it, once it’s defeated, we get the economy back, it’s going to all come back to us very quickly. It comes back very quickly. We have a tremendous economy. We do numbers like no other country has ever done before."
2020-03-20,01:15:32,Donald Trump,"Number one in the world, if you go back two weeks and still obviously, but if you go back two weeks, number one in the world by far. That money comes back to us very rapidly. We want to keep it. We want to have it so that when we are, not if, but when we win the war with the invisible enemy, when we win it, these companies can immediately start. Not that they have to start rebuilding, which takes a long time. Steve. [inaudible 01:15:57] Steve. I’m confident. I’m confident."
2020-03-20,01:16:00,Steve (Reporter),What projections for job losses in March and April are you hearing?
2020-03-20,01:16:03,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at different numbers. We have a best case and a not best case but the big thing is to defeat the virus. Once that virus is defeated, Steve, I think everything else falls in place very rapidly. I think you’re going to have a tremendous upswing. A lot of people agree with me. If you look at your stock market geniuses and some of whom are not geniuses, but they think they are, a lot of people think that I’m right about that, that once we defeat the virus, I think you’re going to have a very steep, like a rocket ship. It’s going to go up and everything will be back and I really believe we’re going to be stronger than ever before. Go ahead."
2020-03-20,01:16:41,Unnamed,"On the issue of supplies, you’ve told governors to try to find whatever supplies they can on their own but some of them are now saying when they go to try to buy them, they’re being outbid by the federal government."
2020-03-20,01:16:51,Donald Trump,"You heard my news conference yesterday. [crosstalk 01:16:55] yesterday’s news. No, that does happen because they want to buy supplies. We want to buy as a backup to them in case they can’t and sometimes that will happen, but regardless of who gets them when they need them, we’re getting them to them. Now we’re doing the Production Act, we’re doing it very much and we have a lot of things cooking right now at a high level."
2020-03-20,01:17:14,Donald Trump,"Remember this, nothing like this has ever happened before. Over 140 countries and you have supply chains that are broken down for two reasons because they can’t supply that much and because people are sick and they can’t be on the chain. So you have a lot of interesting things all over the world. You have supply chains that broke down because of the illness and also because of the fact that the quantity. But we’re getting it ordered, we’re getting it done and you just have to look. Some of you were at the call yesterday where I spoke with the governors, almost all of the governors, and every one of them was very impressed with what we’ve done. Go ahead. In the middle. [inaudible 01:17:55]"
2020-03-20,01:17:56,Unnamed,The labor department has told states not to disclose their numbers. Do you agree with that?
2020-03-20,01:18:00,Donald Trump,I would have to talk to them. I would have to talk to them.
2020-03-20,01:18:03,Unnamed,One more clarifying question if I could on the DPA. I just want to be clear. Are you saying that the administration is requiring these industries to create these products or just asking?
2020-03-20,01:18:12,Donald Trump,"So far we haven’t had to. It’s an amazing thing that happened. We’re getting calls from automobile companies. We’re getting calls from other companies saying they have plant capacity. They want to make ventilators. They want to make other things. We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that want to do the work. They want to do the job. They want to help us. They want to help our country, so we haven’t had a problem with that at all."
2020-03-20,01:18:35,Unnamed,How can you help out states and localities that are trying to bid on things like ventilators and other items that are being outbid by the [inaudible 01:18:46]?
2020-03-20,01:18:46,Donald Trump,"Well when they call us they let us know. If there’s a conflict they will call us and we will drop our bid because we want them to go first because their point, at point of sale. So we’ve had four or five instances where literally that was happening because you know we’re both trying to get stock and if we’re going against, they will call us, the smart ones frankly, will call us and we will immediately, we want them to buy it because it gets to them quicker if they buy it."
2020-03-20,01:19:15,Unnamed,Do they know that they’re…
2020-03-20,01:19:16,Donald Trump,"They know that and it’s happening more and more where they’re calling and they’re saying, we’re bidding against each other. They want to get it. They’ll get it much quicker that way. [crosstalk 01:19:27] Go ahead, please."
2020-03-20,01:19:28,Unnamed,Mr. President just had a question for Secretary Azar. There are labs across the country that don’t have the testing supplies they need. What specific actions is the administration taking…
2020-03-20,01:19:41,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s going very well. I tell you what."
2020-03-20,01:19:41,Unnamed,What specific action have they taken…
2020-03-20,01:19:42,Donald Trump,"We inherited an obsolete deal and we’ve made a good thing out of it. I haven’t heard that question in awhile, but go ahead."
2020-03-20,01:19:47,Alex Azar,"So first, we’re making tremendous progress in terms of lab testing. Tens of thousands of tests are being done every single day, both through the CDC and the public health labs as well as now through the private sector commercial labs. They’re getting to scale, they have supplies, they have high throughput. We do hear anecdotally occasionally of say a public health lab or another one that has a concern about this supply or that supply."
2020-03-20,01:20:14,Alex Azar,"Through FEMA, we actually are standing up a laboratory task force to answer those questions. Usually it’s that the lab people do not understand that there are actually alternative supplies in the marketplace that they are perfectly free to use. We’ve actually had to put out some common myths and truths about that."
2020-03-20,01:20:32,Alex Azar,"For instance, the other day we were getting calls from governors saying we don’t have swabs. There are no swabs. There are no swabs. Our supply people went in the open marketplace and bought 200,000 swabs in the open market and I just sent a letter to every governor sending them swabs. So some of it’s just they aren’t listening or checking with us about all the freedom, all the capacities out there."
2020-03-20,01:20:55,Alex Azar,"It’s a complex system with 330 million Americans and all of these labs, so sometimes there’s a lab that doesn’t understand how much flexibility they have and how much supply there is out there and we’re working through the new FEMA integration center to help correct that for folks."
2020-03-20,01:21:13,Mike Pence,"[inaudible 01:21:13] Well, as I said, more and more tests are being performed every day and as we learn about the results that are being reported around the country of Coronavirus tests, our experts continue to look at the numbers and see that some 90% of Americans that are tested do not test positive for the Coronavirus. And so it can give you a sense of the magnitude of testing that’s going on. We have the number of cases that we’ve reported today, but it’s in some cases near to 10 times that that had been tested. But let me also emphasize how important it was in answering these questions for governors and local officials that the president stood up FEMA and the national response center where we briefed governors yesterday."
2020-03-20,01:22:03,Mike Pence,"Now every governor and their state department, state health departments have the ability to reach out to our regional FEMA administrators and that’s how, as the president said, we’re sorting out those potential conflicts between very significant federal purchases and procurements and as hospitals and state governments are purchasing as well. I think the new streamlined system operating now in all 50 States in our territories of governors and States going through their regional administrator for FEMA is going to make it more possible for us to ensure that our hospitals or healthcare providers have access to what’s available on the open market and elsewhere."
2020-03-20,01:22:48,Unnamed,"Mr president, you’re the head of the task force. You’ve seen the numbers, you’ve spoken to average Americans, you’re a former governor. What do you say to Americans right now who are watching and who are scared?"
2020-03-20,01:22:57,Mike Pence,"I would say, do not be afraid to be vigilant. All the experts tell us that the risk of serious illness to the average American for the Coronavirus is low, but we need every American to put into practice the president’s Coronavirus guidelines, 15 days to slow the spread, because the Coronavirus is about three times more contagious than the flu according to our best estimate and you can contract the Coronavirus, have very mild symptoms, if any, not even be aware that you have it, and expose someone who is vulnerable to a very serious health outcome."
2020-03-20,01:23:39,Mike Pence,"That’s the reason why we’re encouraging people to avoid groups of more than 10, to not eat in restaurants but to use drive throughs, to wash their hands on a regular basis, and particularly we’re going to continue as the president has directed us to on the most vulnerable population, which are seniors with serious underlying health conditions or anyone with an underlining immunodeficiency. It’s those people we need to care for, but it’s going to take all of us working together to make sure they’re safe. [crosstalk 01:24:14]"
2020-03-20,01:24:13,Unnamed,"You just said that you haven’t had to require companies to up their production of medical supplies, but you’ve said last night you have invoked DPA. I’m confused…"
2020-03-20,01:24:23,Donald Trump,"When we need something because of the act. When we need something, we order something and as you know, two days ago I invoked the act, which was a big step. I’m not sure that it had been done before, certainly not very much and when we need something, we will use the act. What has happened is before we even go out, many, many companies, great companies, companies in a totally different business are willing to do things and make things because that’s what they do, they make product. They’re willing to make product for us, medical product that we need very badly for the States that the States can’t get, they haven’t been able to get. And you know most of the States in no way did they do anything wrong. They were stocked up, they were all equipped. Unfortunately they’ve never had a thing like this. So they need help from the federal government. [crosstalk 01:25:09]"
2020-03-20,01:25:09,Unnamed,This is important. You haven’t actually directed any companies to start making more ventilators or masks.
2020-03-20,01:25:17,Donald Trump,"I have. I have, yes."
2020-03-20,01:25:17,Unnamed,How many?
2020-03-20,01:25:17,Donald Trump,"A lot. A lot. And they’re making it a lot of ventilators and they make it a lot of masks. Go ahead, please. Go ahead."
2020-03-20,01:25:25,Unnamed,"Mr. President, partially following up on that, are there auto makers right now who are retooling their production facilities to make ventilators or [inaudible 00:10:34]."
2020-03-20,01:25:33,Donald Trump,"I can’t say they are, but they will be very shortly because we’re working with one in particular, the ones to make ventilators. They called us yesterday and they’re already, we’re working on a transaction. They’re going to make ventilators. They say they’ve done it before, which surprised me, but they can do it very easily. [crosstalk 01:25:53]"
2020-03-20,01:25:55,Unnamed,"This is a question for you, partially for Secretary Azar. You said yesterday that you had spoken to Carnival corporation’s chairman? Yes. And he said that he could donate some shifts."
2020-03-20,01:26:07,Donald Trump,"No, not donate. That’s not the word, donate. He’s not giving them. He’s going to let me use them. I spoke with Micky Arison who is the president, chairman, CEO and owner. [crosstalk 01:26:19] He said to me that he was willing to, if we need ships, if we need ships for helping people, that Carnival would be absolutely willing to help us in Los Angeles, in New York, wherever they may be in Miami where they’re very big. If we needed something, they would be willing to. So far we haven’t needed to. And we’re bringing the big hospital ships up in California. We haven’t, we’re working with the governor of California as you know, with Gavin and we haven’t made a determination. We’re also talking to folks who would like it in Seattle, so where we’re discussing where it can be most useful. We’ve spoken with governor Cuomo and we’re bringing the big hospital ship up in two weeks and we’re going to have it in New York Harbor someplace in New York Harbor."
2020-03-20,01:27:02,Unnamed,"So, so right. So my question is one, it sounds like you haven’t taken them up on it yet…"
2020-03-20,01:27:07,Donald Trump,"No, I haven’t taken them up on it yet. I said, if we need it, I’ll let you know. That’s called taking them up."
2020-03-20,01:27:10,Unnamed,And secondly…
2020-03-20,01:27:10,Donald Trump,"Right now, we don’t need it."
2020-03-20,01:27:14,Unnamed,"The cruise ships have a lot of frequently contacted surfaces and so this is where you come in, Secretary Azar, potentially Dr. Fauci Do you have concerns about those cruise ships being used as hospitals?"
2020-03-20,01:27:24,Donald Trump,"What I can tell you, they’re very clean and also those surfaces, the germ, as you know, the virus disappears over a period of time and these ships are very clean. They’ve been kept very clean, they’d been gone over. But the virus, as you know, if it’s on a surface for a certain, they have actually charts different kinds of surfaces, it disappears over a period of time."
2020-03-20,01:27:44,Unnamed,Why not just use hotels?
2020-03-20,01:27:47,Donald Trump,What are you trying to get at? Go ahead.
2020-03-20,01:27:48,Unnamed,Well that’s what I’m asking. Why not just use hotels?
2020-03-20,01:27:50,Donald Trump,"It disappears. The virus disappears when it’s on surface after a certain number of days or in some cases, hours depending on the surface."
2020-03-20,01:28:02,Unnamed,"Thank you. A quick follow up. So can you say, can you name any of the companies that you’ve asked to start making these ventilators or face masks?"
2020-03-20,01:28:09,Donald Trump,"I will be, but first I want to get the approval from the company because I don’t want to be doing that. I assume they’d like it, but I’ll let you know."
2020-03-20,01:28:18,Unnamed,"Okay, well thank, and this is for Dr. Fauci…"
2020-03-20,01:28:19,Donald Trump,"One company that has openly stated it is General Motors, one of the companies, [crosstalk 01:28:25] but I didn’t speak to them about announcing it, but I’ll announce it. I’m sure they wouldn’t be. But we have others also."
2020-03-20,01:28:31,Unnamed,"Okay, thank you. And so for Dr. Fauci, there’s new research out that the CDC has released that many of the people that have, or that 13% of the people with the Coronavirus got it from someone that was asymptomatic. So my question is, does that change the way the approach that should be taken? And do you think that’s the case or do you think that, or do you not agree with that research?"
2020-03-20,01:28:55,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The recommendations that are here applies to whether you’re in physical contact with someone who could be infected with symptoms versus asymptomatic? I don’t really think it changes anything. Certainly there is some degree of asymptomatic transmissibility. It’s still not quite clear exactly what that is. But when people focus on that, I think they take their eye off the real ball, which is the things you do will mitigate against getting infected no matter whether you’re near someone who is asymptomatic or not. It’s the same thing, physical separation and the care that’s outlined here is going to take care of both of those things. [crosstalk 01:29:34]"
2020-03-20,01:29:33,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President, I have a question about testing. When will every American who needs a test get a test and be able to get a test and why not have medical equipment being shipped right now to hospitals who need it?"
2020-03-20,01:29:49,Donald Trump,"We’re hearing very positive things about testing and just so you understand, we don’t want every American to go out and get a test. 350 million people. We don’t want that. We want people that have a problem, that have a problem with they’re sneezing they’re sniffling, they don’t feel good, they have a temperature. There are a lot of different things. You know them better than I do. So ready. We don’t need that. But what we are having is we’re having these private labs have come in, they’ve been really fantastic and we also have a great system for the future because as I said, we inherited, we meaning this administration an obsolete broken system that wasn’t meant for anything like this. Now we have a system that you can see because look, we’re well into this and nobody’s even talking about it, except for you, which doesn’t surprise me."
2020-03-20,01:30:37,Unnamed,There are Americans though who say that they have symptoms and they can’t get tested.
2020-03-20,01:30:40,Donald Trump,"Well, okay, I’m not hearing it."
2020-03-20,01:30:41,Unnamed,What do you say to the Americans who are scared [inaudible 01:30:45]?
2020-03-20,01:30:45,Donald Trump,"But we don’t want everybody to go out and get a test because there’s no reason for it. Yeah, we’ll do one more after this."
2020-03-20,01:30:50,Unnamed,"So, I would ask Dr. Fauci, because Kevin [inaudible 01:30:54] is one of the people who is now suggesting that the real way to get to the end of this, for life to return to normal, is for every single person living in this country to be tested. That way you could see who’s contagious and you could then have people who don’t have it go back to work. Is there any possibility that this country could ever get to a point where every single person could be tested and how long would that take?"
2020-03-20,01:31:13,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you for the question. I’ve heard that before. I don’t see, I don’t connect the dots there. I don’t see how testing everybody in the country is going to help you to implement this. This should be implemented universally, at least at this level for everyone. The things we spoke about a while ago that you want to really ratchet it up like Governor Newson is doing in California, like governor Cuomo is doing in New York, or how you put an end to this outbreak. Testing is important. It would be nice to know and there are certain things you could do, but let’s not conflate testing with the action that we have to take. Whether or not you test, do this. I’m not putting down testing as an important issue, but people seem to link them so much that if you don’t have universal testing, you can’t respond to the outbreak. You really can."
2020-03-20,01:32:05,Donald Trump,"But I do think, and that’s after listening to Tony and everybody else that’s an expert. I do think it’s important that not everybody be tested. If you feel great and if you have no symptoms whatsoever, it’s just not a good thing to be doing. Steve."
2020-03-20,01:32:23,Steve (Reporter),"Question for Dr. Fauci. Yesterday you mentioned the possibility of aerosol transmission of the virus. How likely is that to happen? To me,"
2020-03-20,01:32:32,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The possibility of aerosol transmission always comes up when you have situations like that. It comes up with influenza, it came up with SARS in which there was a documented, one off episode of some aerosol transmission. Aerosol means that it can stay in the air for a period time because it’s in a droplet that’s very small and doesn’t go down. Is it possible and that there is aerosol transmission? Yeah, it certainly is, but clearly what we have seen in the situations where people have gotten infected from the areas that we have experience, China, South Korea, now Europe, most of it is in a situation where people are close enough to each other that a symptomatic person will have a real drop the transmission. So I’m not ruling out the possibility that it’s aerosol, but again, it’s not going to substantially change doing this. [crosstalk 01:33:30]"
2020-03-20,01:33:29,John (Reporter),Let me just ask this in a very simple way. What is the demand pressure on testing in this country and are we meeting it?
2020-03-20,01:33:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I get the same calls that many of you get, that someone goes into a place who has a symptom and wants to get a test and for one reason or other multiple logistic technical, what have you, they can’t get it. That is a reality that is happening now. Is it the same as it was a few weeks ago? Absolutely not. Because as the secretary and others have said right now that we have the private sector involved, the availability, not only just availability, but the implementation of the availability is getting better and better and better. Having said that, I understand and empathize with the people who rightfully are saying, I’m trying to get a test and I can’t."
2020-03-20,01:34:21,John (Reporter),So is that a way of saying we are not yet at a point where we are meeting the demand pressure?
2020-03-20,01:34:25,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, the answer is yes, John. We are not there yet because otherwise people would be never calling up saying they can’t get a test. [crosstalk 00:19:35]."
2020-03-20,01:34:33,Donald Trump,Want to finish up? Go ahead.
2020-03-20,01:34:38,Mike Pence,"I just can’t emphasize enough about the incredible progress that we have made on testing. All of your reporting and media outlets around the country are as well, that many, many more tests are being performed every day, literally by the tens of thousands. And this has only been made possible because several weeks ago the president brought in the commercial labs, these enormous companies, Quest and Lab Corp working with companies like Kroche and Abbott Laboratories and Thermo Fisher and said, we have this existing system of state laboratories and the CDC processing tests for certain infections, but given the magnitude of this outbreak, the president apprehended early on that it wouldn’t be enough to meet the need and I just want every American to know that literally hour by hour, in partnership with these extraordinary commercial labs, we are making more and more tests available everyday. We’ll detail the way that we’re working with States to distribute those tests."
2020-03-20,01:35:47,Mike Pence,"We’ve obviously focused on States that have been dealing with the most serious outbreaks of Coronavirus, Washington state, California, New York and others. We’ve been making sure the tests are in those areas, working closely with those governors, but I think the American people should be encouraged at the progress that we are making. Tomorrow we’ll take some time to detail that progress for you, but I would say to any American who might be concerned that they have symptoms, as the president said so well, we don’t want every healthy American to get a test, but if people feel that they have symptoms that they identify with the Coronavirus, call your doctor, their doctor can call their state health authorities that can work very closely with our entire team through HHS and FEMA and work to identify the more and more tests that are available every day."
2020-03-20,01:36:43,Donald Trump,"Just so you know, just for the probably a hundredth time, I, this administration, inherited an obsolete broken old system that wasn’t meant for this. We discarded that system and we now have a new system that can do millions of people as you need them, but we had to get rid of a broken old system that didn’t work. It worked only on a very limited basis and we’re very proud of what we’ve done. It’s incredible what we’ve done and this system will now serve for the future, for future problems."
2020-03-20,01:37:21,Donald Trump,"Hopefully you don’t have a problem like this, but something will come up. We have now a great system and it’s almost fully in gear, but it’s able to test millions of people. But we inherited a broken old, frankly, a terrible system. We fixed it and we’ve done a great job and we haven’t been given the credit that we deserve, that I can tell you. The one that really deserves the credit are the American people because they are doing things that nobody thought they would do. What they’re doing is incredible and we’re making a lot of progress and we’ll see you folks tomorrow. Thank you very much. [crosstalk 01:38:04]"
2020-03-20,01:38:04,Unnamed,"They say that by the end of the month, they won’t have basic medical supplies."
2020-03-21,01:22,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. A lot of things going on and we’re going to be going over the Hill and there were a lot of meetings and from the financial, this is a medical situation, not a financial situation. Financial though is moving along very nicely. I want to thank you for being here and update you on the progress we’ve made after a week of extraordinary mobilization in our war against the virus. Governors, mayors, the businesses, charities and citizens are all working with urgency and speed toward one common goal, which is saving American lives. We’re in communication with foreign countries. It’s now at 148 foreign countries. Can you believe that? 100. You talk about a spread. You talk about a violent spread, 148 countries, not even believable. There’s been a week of national action and of great national solidarity. People are getting along. We’re getting along with the Republicans and Democrats and Independents and liberals and conservatives and actually it’s a very nice thing to say."
2020-03-21,02:39,Donald Trump,"We’re all one beautiful big American family and that’s taking place right now. Last night I approved major disaster declaration for the state of New York, worked very closely with Governor Cuomo and this is the first time in our nation’s history that a President’s used the Stafford Act to a major disaster in response to a public health crisis. Never happened before. I’m considering other areas where we may or may not be doing that and I’m working very closely with Gavin Newsom, governor of California and others. We may be doing the same thing depending on their needs, depending on what they’re asking for. It’s been unprecedented action in New York and we’ve had a tremendous federal response all over the country and I want to thank all the people in the federal government and obviously in the state governments and local governments. We are working hard, everybody is working hard and the people standing alongside of me are working very hard that I can tell you."
2020-03-21,03:49,Donald Trump,"We’ve also reached agreements with Canada and Mexico on new travel rules at our Northern and Southern borders to halt the entry of the Chinese virus. Well continuing trade and commerce and we’ve had very good talks. I’ve with Prime minister Trudeau and today this morning with President Lopez Obrador. We talked about joint measures that we’re taking to prevent the spread of the virus in our countries and to temporarily suspend non essential travel. We had a great conversation this morning, President of Mexico and our close cooperation with Mexico and Canada will keep our people healthy, keep their people healthy, keep everybody safe. Yesterday I had a call with 12,000 small businesses, representatives of these businesses. That’s the engine of our country. People don’t realize that, you read all about the big ones, but the small business, when you add them up together is really the engine economic engine of our country, and I assured them that my administration is doing everything within, it’s very considerable, considerable power, frankly, to support them and their employees."
2020-03-21,05:04,Donald Trump,"Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. Likewise, I had calls during the week with all sorts of representatives and systems like the hospital system. We spoke to many of the hospital systems throughout the country, nurses and doctors, representatives representing hundreds of thousands of nurses and doctors. Airlines and cruise ship companies, the business round table, which was fully attended and it’s all of the top CEOs of our country and beyond, frankly. The businessmen have really, these are world world styled businessmen. These are businessmen that control the biggest companies in the world. Many of them have taken hits and many of them are just going forward."
2020-03-21,05:52,Donald Trump,"I’ll tell you, businesses have been, have been great. Some have been very badly affected, some haven’t been affected at all and frankly, some are doing very well. They continue to do very well. It’s a, Walmart i an example. It’s been really helpful to us. Doug McMillan, the head of Walmart really helpful to us and I guess I assume they’re doing pretty well cause people are certainly buying, buying more than even a clip at Christmas by substantial numbers. Pretty amazing, but they’re doing incredibly, they put on tremendous extra staff. You don’t have empty shelves. A lot of things have happened that are very good."
2020-03-21,06:29,Donald Trump,"Restaurants, fast food executives, grocery stores, all retailers. Literally all of them in groups. And we spoke with the G7 leaders at length. As you know, you probably know about that. Spoke to many of the governors, spoke to almost all of the governors, had conference calls and many of the governors individually. And very importantly the religious leaders. We had a great conversation yesterday, the Vice-President and myself with the religious leaders of our country, many of the religious leaders and we’ve had a number of them during the course of the last two weeks actually, but yesterday we had a very, very significant call with the religious leaders of our country."
2020-03-21,07:14,Donald Trump,"I signed legislation providing American workers with paid sick leave and paid family medical leave at no cost to employers. And free testing for those who need it. The testing’s going very well and the Admiral will speak to that along with Tony. We’re working quickly to pass additional legislation that will provide massive relief to small businesses and affected industries and give direct payments to our great workers and hardworking American families. There’s never been anything like we’re doing on the Hill right now. Their negotiating, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, they’re all up there. Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi, they’re all negotiating and everybody’s working hard and they want to get to a solution that’s the right solution. I think we’re getting very close. We’ve also announced that we’ve moved tax day from April 15th to July 15th which is a big deal giving businesses and individuals extra time to file and pay without interest or penalty."
2020-03-21,08:19,Donald Trump,"So we’ve moved the date way back and so it’ll be July 15th instead of your traditional April 15th and very importantly you will have a lot of time but you’re not going to have interest penalties or any kind of penalties by filing. At that later date, HUD announced that foreclosures and evictions are suspended for single family home owners with FHA insured mortgages for the next 60 days. And our great head of HUD, who’s with us today, Ben Carson’s going to say a few words in a moment. The Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing, which is another big deal requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current school year. Not fair to do that. So we were waiving that. I would imagine it’s probably the first time ever that’s been waived, but I think it’s only fair to the students and to the parents of the students."
2020-03-21,09:18,Donald Trump,"It is also waiving interest and other things that we’re discussing right now on federally held student loans and directed that borrowers be allowed to suspend their student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days. And we’ll be talking about student loans, going to help the students. They’re under a great burden right now so we will be talking about that further. But we’re waiving during this 60 day period various elements and very important elements on student loans. Big subject. I signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act, as you all know, giving us powerful new authorities to help states, cities, and hospitals procure needed supplies."
2020-03-21,10:02,Donald Trump,"There’s been a clear call to action to the private sector and the call is made right here. It’s been really pretty amazing what’s happened with the private sector. They are really in a sixth gear I think, which has responded in full force helping to produce and supply much needed masks, swabs, sanitizers, ventilators, and everything else is a, there’s a move on that’s incredible right now. And by way of example, Hanes, everybody knows Hanes, great company, great consumer cotton products company is retrofitting its manufacturing capabilities in large sections of their plants to produce masks. And they’re in that process right now. And at my direction, the FDA has taken rapid steps to make these items available for medical use right now. I mean most excitingly to me is what the FDA has done in order to get a possibly a very successful number. It’s not just one or two number of therapeutics, medicines that can help people that are already sick, help people not get sick. And obviously you know about the vaccine and Tony, we’ll discuss that a little bit later, but the vaccine is moving along."
2020-03-21,11:26,Donald Trump,"But this is something that right now for right now, like this is what we really, it’s incredible. And what the FDA has done, and Dr. Steven Hahn, who’s highly respected, came as a, just a highly respected man. He’s been fantastic. He’s only been here for a couple of months and he’s gotten thrown into the swim of it and he’s really standing up. But the FDA has really moved mountains. I said it this morning they moved mountains to get approvals on things that maybe work we’ll find out very soon, it won’t take along."
2020-03-21,11:58,Donald Trump,"Along an example of the [inaudible 00: 12:02], which is a, this is really an example where we’re purposing alcohol. They went out and repurposed their alcohol production capabilities in Arkansas, Kentucky, Texas, and West Virginia to make hand sanitizer. That’s a big difference and they’d been unbelievable. They really, [inaudible 00:12:22], their first delivery will be on Tuesday. It’s going to go to various states. They’re going to start, I think in New York and they’re going to work their way around. They’re making a tremendous amount of hand sanitizer at a very high level too, by the way."
2020-03-21,12:42,Donald Trump,"We’ve activated the National Response Coordination Center to level one, that’s your highest level. There’s the nerve center of all of our government response to crisis and it’s coordinating very closely with our nation’s governors. Our nation’s governors, as many of you were at the call yesterday with the governors and I think you can see the relationship. And we’ve had numerous calls with governors by the way, but the relationships are pretty amazing. They’re loving what we’re doing and the coordination between the federal government and the governors States and even local has been pretty incredible. FEMA administrator, Pete Gaynor, who is with us will soon be providing you with an update on the center’s operations and FEMA has been incredible. We got them involved last week, very much involved and now they’re involved nationwide."
2020-03-21,13:37,Donald Trump,We’ve dramatically expanded telehealth so Americans can see a doctor without leaving home something which more and more people are using and now they’re really using it. And now the ones that are using it are loving it. And I think we’re going to change the way our country functions medically and probably in other ways because of what’s going on right now. This will reduce the chance of infection and preserve hospital capacity. So it solves a lot of problems.
2020-03-21,14:05,Donald Trump,"Every American has a role to play in defending our nation from this invisible, horrible enemy. It really is. It’s an invisible enemy and we will be successful, very successful, hopefully very much sooner than people would even think. So we say stay at home and save lives. There’s a time of shared national sacrifice, but it’s also a time to treasure our loved ones and to take stock of what is most important, our faith, our families, our neighbors, and our great country. And I want to thank all of the incredible people of our country, the citizens of our country, that what you’ve done and the way you’re responding has just been a very special, something that we will never forget, that the history books will never forget. And we’re going to have a great victory. We’re going to be celebrating a great victory in the not too distant future."
2020-03-21,15:04,Donald Trump,"And I just want to thank everybody and now I’ll introduce our vice president Mike Pence, who’s led the task force. And I will tell you this, he has not slept much, maybe a tiny bit, maybe a little bit, but not much. And he’s done an incredible job. Mike, thank you. Please."
2020-03-21,15:35,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President. Good afternoon all and thank you Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today. We briefed the President on our latest recommendations. We continue at the President’s direction to lead, not a whole of government approach, but a whole of America approach. You just heard the President describe one inspiring story after another at the way the American people are responding, the way American businesses are responding, religious communities across this country. The American people are coming together, they’re responding with common sense, compassion and generosity. People are heeding the advice of state and local authorities and tens of millions of Americans are putting into practice 15 days to slow the spread."
2020-03-21,16:24,Mike Pence,"We are officially, Mr. President, it’s six days into our 15 days and as we look all across this country, while we strongly support the decisions that governors in states where we have significant outbreak have taken and we encourage every American to listen to those state and local authorities for every American this is what you can do to make a difference. Over the next week and a few days to protect your health, protect your family’s health, but most especially slow the spread and the potential for the Corona virus to impact the most vulnerable."
2020-03-21,17:06,Mike Pence,"As the President said, we’ve almost been overwhelmed at the outpouring of support from American businesses. The President spoke yesterday to thousands of small businesses. We spoke to manufacturers yesterday and in fact, as the President indicated, the FDA in record time just approved one manufacturer that will be producing millions of surgical masks in a matter of weeks for the American people. The pastors we spoke to we want to thank all the religious leaders from every community of faith in the country, making the hard choice to suspend services, to have online services even while those ministries are continuing to support food banks and come alongside of the most vulnerable."
2020-03-21,17:54,Mike Pence,"And of course the chorus of prayers that is coming up from communities of faith around the country is making the difference that it always has in the life of this nation. One thing the President and I promise was to remind people that on the weekends that you’re not in the pews. It’s still a good, it’s still a good idea to, if you can, to go ahead and make that donation because cause all the ministries are continuing to play a vital role in our communities and we encourage your continued support."
2020-03-21,18:23,Mike Pence,"The President and I are grateful that the American people are listening to state and local authorities and and putting into practice all of all of the recommendations in the president’s coronavirus guidelines. And as you will hear in just a few moments from Admiral [Giroir 00:18:41], testing is expanding rapidly across the United States of America. State run drive throughs are expanding across the country and as you will hear detailed this morning, now more than 195,000 Americans and more who have been symptomatic have been tested. That number does not include county hospitals or healthcare labs around the nation, some 15,000 in number. And among the number of the more than 195,000 that have been tested it’s important to remember that only 19,343 at this moment have tested positive for the Coronavirus."
2020-03-21,19:24,Mike Pence,"We want to continue to urge a state and local health authorities to contact FEMA for all the latest developments and innovations in testing. But we want to remind Americans as Dr. Fauci will emphasize in a moment, if you don’t have symptoms, don’t do a test. It is another way that the American people can make sure that we are preserving the resources that our healthcare workers need to minister and to support those who are dealing with the Coronavirus and other illnesses. In a moment, Pete Gaynor will detail the efforts at FEMA since the President’s national emergency declaration."
2020-03-21,20:04,Mike Pence,"We have FEMA in the lead. Stood up the National Response Coordination center as the president said, and we are working closely literally hour by hour through FEMA processing requests from states most impacted like New York, Washington state and California. And we’ll continue to work very, very closely with those states through the very traditional means of federal emergency management at FEMA. Secretary Carson will describe decisive actions the President alluded to, to bring foreclosure relief to Americans. And on the subject of supplies, in a moment you will hear of not only the progress that we’re making on testing, but on Monday we’ll be detailing for the American people the progress that we are making on the President’s strategy of procuring more personal protective equipment and medical supplies. Allocating them through the system of FEMA and continuing to urge conservation by Americans. In fact, I’m pleased to report to the president today that HHS just placed an order for hundreds of millions of N95 mass that will be being made available to healthcare providers across the country."
2020-03-21,21:18,Mike Pence,"On behalf of the President. We do renew our call for Americans to postpone elective medical procedures including dental services and remember this is another way that you’re going to make sure that medical supplies are available because by postponing elective medical procedures you’re freeing up medical supplies for those dealing with the Coronavirus. As the President mentioned, our team is on Capitol Hill as we speak, working with members of Congress in both political parties. They’re making progress by all accounts on a bipartisan bill. They worked late into the night last night. It started early this morning and we are working to pass that legislation on Monday in both the House and the Senate. Now on a personal note, many of you may have been made aware that a member of my staff has tested positive for the Coronavirus. We learned of that late yesterday. I am pleased to report that he’s doing well. He had mild cold like symptoms for about a day and a half. Has not been to the White House since Monday. Neither the President nor I had direct contact with that staff person. We worked immediately with the White House physician and the CDC. We’ve done all contact tracing and while the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as Vice-President and as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, both I and my wife will be tested for the Corona virus later this afternoon."
2020-03-21,22:52,Mike Pence,Let me say again how grateful the President and I are that every American has acted on the President’s coronavirus guidelines. We are six days into 15 days. That has Dr. Fauci-
2020-03-21,23:03,Mike Pence,"We are six days into 15 days, but as Dr. Fauci may well reflect in a moment is an opportunity for us here on the foot holes of this epidemic curve in our country to literally lower the impact in our nation and save lives. Every American can do their part to slow the spread and we encourage you each to continue to do that. As the president says often, remember, we’re all in this together. And also remember that for most Americans, their risk of serious illness from the coronavirus remains low. The reason we want to put into practice the president’s coronavirus guidelines is because no American would want to inadvertently expose someone who is vulnerable, a senior with a serious underlying health condition to the coronavirus with a potential threat."
2020-03-21,23:52,Mike Pence,"I did hear one story this morning, Mr. President, about a senior named, Geneva Wood. She actually is at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington. She is not only a grandmother, she is a great, great grandmother, 90 years young and she tested positive for the coronavirus on March 6th, but by all accounts she’s doing well and she wanted America to know there is hope. And her strength and her enthusiasm is truly an inspiration to the nation. As the president said many times and we’re going to get through this and come out stronger than ever before. And we’ll get through this as Americans together. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-21,24:30,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. Admiral."
2020-03-21,24:37,Brett Giroir,"Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. As I told you earlier last week, we are in the process and are effectively transitioning to large scale testing by leveraging all the components of the American healthcare system. When we started, it was CDC only, then it was the state public health laboratories, now we’re transitioning into the mainstream of American testing with many of the companies that the president invited in the Rose Garden just a week ago. So currently, 91 public health laboratories, state public health laboratories, are up and running in 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. This is our curve and I want to be very clear about this, that this only accounts for CDC, state public health laboratories, and the laboratories that are members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association. These are the main reference laboratories, Labcorp, Quest, Mayo, [inaudible 00:25:37], BioReference Labs, and Sonic Healthcare. It does not account for the well over 10,000, 15,000 hospital-based labs, many of which are doing testing for whom we will get data this week to give you an overall roll out."
2020-03-21,25:52,Brett Giroir,"As you can see over 195,000 people in America have completed their testing. That means tests plus results. This does not count the people whose tests are in process. And as you see this curve is going, it will continue to rise dramatically over the next period of time. So again, this is utilizing all the components of the great American healthcare system, the state and local public health laboratories, the hospital system, which is not represented here, and the main reference laboratories."
2020-03-21,26:27,Brett Giroir,"Now, I do want to make it clear that although testing is becoming more available and Dr. Fauci will definitely emphasize this more, there are priorities for testing. And clearly everyone across the country should understand that those hospitalized or in an ICU or a priority for testing. Symptomatic healthcare workers, for obvious reasons, we want to make sure that their health is preserved and that they are not going to spread to those who may be seriously ill. Symptomatic people in longterm care facilities, as the vice president has highlighted and we’ve said many times, elderly in our society have a much higher mortality rate, much higher serious complication rate. Symptomatic individuals over 65, symptomatic individuals who have underlying conditions like chronic heart disease or liver disease or other types of chronic diseases, patients in public health investigations, and there are local priorities around the country, particularly healthcare workers for testing. And Dr. Fauci is going to emphasize this about the types of people who may not be to be testing. Testing is going well, it’s ramping up, but we should still have priorities."
2020-03-21,27:37,Brett Giroir,"Finally, I want to talk about the community-based testing sites. I know they’re popular now because there’s now an acronym which I’m sure the vice president doesn’t appreciate, CBTS or CBT sites. We talked about these earlier in the week and I wanted to emphasize again that these are state managed and locally executed. The federal government is there to provide support, knowhow, blueprints on how to do this, but these are really springing up at dozens and dozens of sites all over the country adapted to the local needs. Some are drive through, some are up, some are geared to healthcare workers and emergency responders. So again, what we see in the upcoming week is this curve will continue to increase as testing becomes more widely available. As the great American health care industry continues to increase the availability of tests and the throughput of those tests. Thank you, sir."
2020-03-21,28:35,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Admiral. Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-21,28:35,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. What I’m going to do just over the next minute or so is maybe connect some of the dots, the things that you’ve heard today. First, the status of the dynamics of the outbreak. I mean, you all know the numbers, you’ve seen them. We have widespread infection, but to varying degrees throughout the country. So for example, when you talk about the kinds of mitigation issues that we have put forth and have emphasized, just as I mentioned the other day, there are two dynamic forces that are going on at the same time. You’re having the natural course of an outbreak trying to peak at a high level, and then you have the mitigation strategies which are aimed at dampening that. We’ve mentioned that multiple times. We often get asked, how do you know you’re having an effect? Because there are two things that are going on at the same time, they may be confounding."
2020-03-21,29:26,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, I can tell you for sure from a public health standpoint and experience with other outbreaks, we know we are clearly having an effect, but we can’t quantitate it for you accurately now because looking forward, you’ll know what the impact of the rate of this steep inclines will be. So that’s what we’re going to come back to you every day and keep you up to date about that."
2020-03-21,29:49,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Getting with regard to the disproportionate of the response. Everyone is right here. I’ll get to open up the vice president’s book with his permission. This is baseline for everyone. In other words throughout the country. But then there will be areas, and you’ve heard them, Washington state, California, New York City in which the dynamics of the outbreak are clearly different and much more robust if you want to use that word. And that’s the reason why we’ve seen the mitigation ratcheted up in that regard. And again, hopefully, and I have confidence it will happen, you will see impact on that."
2020-03-21,30:28,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Next, getting to testing. You saw the numbers with testing. Remember there was always an issue with testing. I think we’re getting to the solution that everybody in the country is looking for, but I want to emphasize one thing that Admiral Giroir mentioned is that not every single person in the United States needs to get tested. He gave you the priorities. I don’t want to repeat them, but let me tell you one of the unintended consequences of individuals who don’t need to get tested that flood the desire to get tested."
2020-03-21,31:02,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Currently, and I hope we’ll be able to change it and make it much less reliable on PPEs, when you go in and get tested, you are consuming personal protective equipment, masks and gowns. Those are high priority for the health care workers who are taking care of people who have coronavirus disease. So what we don’t want to do is to have a situation where we will, we do have disparities in availability of PPEs now and we’re working hard to correct that. But currently today we want to make sure that the people who are taking care of people with coronavirus disease do not endanger themselves because they don’t have the personal protective equipment."
2020-03-21,31:47,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And then finally, one last thing was just mentioned, the surgeon general has been pushing this, please put off, cancel elective medical and surgical procedures. You don’t want to not ever do them, but for the time being don’t do them because they also not only consume personal protective equipment, they may also consume some of the things like ventilators that you might need. So let’s pull in this together and we will get through it, I promise you. Thank you."
2020-03-21,32:15,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Tony, very much."
2020-03-21,32:21,Pete Gaynor,"Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. FEMA is now leading the federal operation or the federal response for all operations on behalf of The White House Coronavirus Task Force who oversees this whole of nation response. HHS will continue to provide their experts matter expertise on health and pursuant to the Nationwide Emergency Declaration, FEMA, in coordination with HHS is assisting state local tribal territorial governments and their other eligible entities with health and safety emergency protective measures on behalf of the American public. As of yesterday, 50 states, the District of Columbia, five territories and one tribe are working directly with FEMA under the Nationwide Emergency Declaration for COVID-19."
2020-03-21,33:06,Pete Gaynor,"In just 24 hours, we’ve obligated $100 million to states, territories and tribes. A little bit about supplies. It is of the utmost importance that requests for assistance, especially for critical supplies get routed through proper channels as soon as possible. And we ask everyone to follow the normal procedures, the normal procedures FEMA uses in a natural disaster. There’s no different procedure for the COVID-19 pandemic, but remember you can still order supplies from your regular vendors and buy it on the open market, buy it where you can find it. We will reimburse you. If you buy medical supplies from foreign sources, it is reimbursable by America, it does not apply to The Stafford Act except for Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. If you can’t buy it on the open market, make a request through the FEMA system. Request for assistance at the local and county level should first go to states, from states to the regional FEMA offices and then from those offices right here in D.C. where the National Response Coordination Center is open and running."
2020-03-21,34:11,Pete Gaynor,"We are getting requests for mass PPE, swab sets, test site supports, ventilators, hospital capacity assessments and many more. We are in lockstep with HHS to answer these requests, but we will do whatever is necessary to get states, tribes, territories and others they what they need. And then finally, what we are doing here in Washington D.C., again, this is a whole of government response, like all emergency response is most successful when it is locally executed, state managed and federally support. We can’t say that enough. On Thursday our federal partners fully integrated with our National Response Coordination Center and additionally all 10 FEMA regions across the country have been activated. The FEMA regional administrators will continue to coordinate closely with governors, state emergency managers, state public health officials to determine the type and level of support needed to respond to this dynamic threat. Thank you, sir."
2020-03-21,35:07,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Pete, appreciate it. Ben, please."
2020-03-21,35:12,Ben Carson,"Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President for your tireless leadership here. And I also want to thank the fellow task force members who have been working around the clock in a very patriotic way to serve their fellow Americans. Part of the American dream is having a home and sometimes people say, “Well what does housing have do it health?” It has everything to do with health, having a safe home. And that is the reason that the president has authorized the immediate cessation of foreclosure and eviction proceedings for American citizens, single family forward mortgages as well as a reverse mortgages. And as you know, FHFA has also decided to do the same thing for 60 days. And the CFPB is very happy with all of this as well. And it’s really all about helping our people, recognizing that they’re being severely impacted by the coronavirus."
2020-03-21,36:20,Ben Carson,"And we’ve also asked the various services of mortgage loans to exercise forbearance for anybody who’s having difficulty. It is important if you’re having difficulty to actually contact the people who have made the loan, who established the mortgage because it doesn’t happen automatically. What does happen automatically is that we cover all 8.5 million people in terms of the moratorium on foreclosures and evictions. We want also for the PHAs to be protected. HUD does not have authority to mandate that evictions can occur, but we are in contact with all the PHAs across the country and are petitioning Congress for the power to be able to actually enforce that. But the fact of the matter is most of the PHAs are run by people who actually care about other people. So we really haven’t seen much of a problem there. We haven’t seen much of a problem with forbearance and needing to try to force people to do it because they want to do it. People are stepping up and saying, “What can we do to be helpful?”"
2020-03-21,37:38,Ben Carson,"As far as housing choice vouchers, Section 8, is concerned. The April vouchers will be sent out next week and May vouchers are already being worked on. And we were also staying in contact with all the stakeholders, the advocates for low income housing as well as other stakeholders to make sure that we’re doing things that are most helpful to them. And additionally, we’ve extended the deadlines for health care and multifamily financial reporting requirements. And that’s for over 20,000 multifamily and health care borrowers until April the 30th. And that provides them with a lot more flexibility to deal with the issues that they’re dealing with. I also want to thank our FHA Commissioner Bryant Montgomery as well as the FHFA a director, Mark Calabria, and Kathy Kraninger, the director of the CFPB who’ve all worked tirelessly with us to make this happen."
2020-03-21,38:45,Ben Carson,"What we’re trying to do is bridge the gap, recognizing that it’s a lot easier for us to take these measures and for Congress to take the measures that they’re taking so that we don’t destroy a very excellent system and have to start all over again. So for those who are worried about the money that’s being spent, if you don’t spend the money and deal with this now, it’s going to cost a whole lot more to try to build all this up again. And as was mentioned by the president, there’s been a sense of unity that we haven’t seen for a long time in this country and let’s hope and pray that that unity lasts far beyond this crisis."
2020-03-21,39:32,Donald Trump,"Ben, thank you very much. A few questions, please."
2020-03-21,39:35,Unnamed,"Mr. President, a few questions if you don’t mind, sir. If you’ve lost your job now or you’re worried that you’re going to lose your job tomorrow, restaurant, something like that, what do you want people to do immediately? The second question, sir, you heard from the vice president that he’s going to be tested. Are you, have you taken a test since last Saturday?"
2020-03-21,39:51,Donald Trump,I just took one.
2020-03-21,39:52,Unnamed,You just took one. How are you feeling?
2020-03-21,39:54,Donald Trump,I feel great. I hope I look good. Those people are going to be. [crosstalk 00:40:01].
2020-03-21,40:06,Unnamed,"Okay, so for those people that have lost their job already or they’re worried that they’re about to lose it tomorrow or the next day, what do you want them to do right-"
2020-03-21,40:11,Donald Trump,"Well, what they do right now is keep receiving their paycheck and hopefully their companies are going to be in a very strong position. We want to keep everything together because we think we’re going to have a tremendous bounce back. Now, some people agree with that very strongly. Some of our top economists, they think we’re going to have a very, once we solve the problem of that we’re working on, the medical problem. So we want them to keep their jobs, stay where you are and we’ll see what happens. Now if they don’t, we have unemployment, we have checks, we have a lot of things happening, a lot of very positive things nobody has ever done. Now this is working with Democrats, this is Republicans and Democrats and myself working together. Nobody’s ever done a package like this. It’s a great package. But ideally we want them to be able to keep their jabs, keep the pay coming. And I think that’s going to happen. Kelly, go ahead."
2020-03-21,40:57,Kelly,"Mr. President, on your Defense Production Act power, one of the features of that is that the federal government would be able to control the output, whether it’s masks or ventilators, get it to the most areas of need and control the pricing to keep it at a market level so it’s not price gouging. One of the things we’re hearing from governors, they can’t find supplies and prices have gone up. So you’ve talked about the act, sir, but you have not yet compelled any companies. Why not?"
2020-03-21,41:24,Donald Trump,"Because we have so many companies making so many products. Every product that you mentioned plus ventilators and everything else. We have car companies without having to use the act. If we don’t have to use specifically, we have the act to use in case we need it, but we have so many things being made right now by so many they’ve just stepped up. In fact, Mike Pence and I were discussing it before. We’ve never seen anything like it where they are volunteering. We want to make masks who are not, like Hanes. I brought that up as an example. General Motors, I bring that up as another, Ford. They’re going to go on the open market. We want them on the open market from the standpoint of pricing because otherwise it’s going to be, we could be very unfairly [crosstalk 00:00:42:03]."
2020-03-21,42:04,Kelly,How do you direct them to the places in greatest need?
2020-03-21,42:06,Donald Trump,"We are directing states and sometimes we’ll be competing against states, which I don’t want and we’ll drop out of the bidding. We want the states to go first and you know what we’re doing is we’re helping states. That’s what we want to do. Same thing with the testing. We’re helping states, we’re helping states get to where they want and we’ve made tremendous progress in every aspect of it."
2020-03-21,42:27,Kelly,"This happens, [crosstalk 00:42:28] need equipment today."
2020-03-21,42:27,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s happening pretty fast right now and the governors are out there trying to get and if they are competing with us, we immediately drop out. Please."
2020-03-21,42:36,Unnamed,"Mr. President, forgive me if I heard you wrong at the beginning, but you said something, we are going to be going over to the Hill. Are you going yourself?"
2020-03-21,42:44,Donald Trump,My people are and I’ll be staying here. I’ll be in the Oval Office and various other places in the White House.
2020-03-21,42:49,Unnamed,"And on that matter. You’re asking Congress to essentially pass a series of legislation that’s going to amount to about $2 trillion, 10% of the GDP. What do you say to members in both parties who say, this is too expensive, this is just too much to debate and get done in 48 hours or so. And also have you spoken directly with Speaker Pelosi at all about any of this?"
2020-03-21,43:10,Donald Trump,"So I’ve spoken with, I’m not going to say who I speak with, but I’ve spoken with directly or indirectly everybody many, many times. We’re doing very well. I think the Democrats and the Republicans are going to come up with a package that’s going to be really something very special. It’s going to help people. This is the first time there’s ever been a case where you want people not to work. It’s always, you want to create an incentive to work. We’re creating not an incentive not to work, but the fact is we’re asking people not to work because of they have to stay away from each other. If we’re going to kill this horrible hidden enemy, we have to stay away. So there’s never been a thing like this in the history of the world. And other nations are doing similar things, some effectively, some not effectively. They’re doing similar things."
2020-03-21,43:58,Donald Trump,"We are creating a package that’s going to keep companies together, keep workers paid so they can live and sustain. We’ll see what the timing is. The biggest thing we can do is get rid of the problem. The problem is exactly what we know, the medical problem. We want to have this whole incredible situation that it can start right away. Not that all of these companies break up, all the workers are out of jobs. You can’t put them back together and it would take years to put them back together because we had the greatest economy in the history of the world until we got hit by this problem. And we can be back very, very quickly. And it’s our intention to be back very, very quickly."
2020-03-21,44:35,Donald Trump,"So we’re doing a package the likes of which nobody’s ever done before. I’m obviously the one that has to approve the different things and the recommendations of the different things. And like buybacks as an example and stock buy backs. I didn’t like it the first time and this time I’m saying, “You’re not doing it.” I don’t want money to be used for that. I want money to be used for workers and for opening businesses, keeping businesses not buy backs. And well, I would, I am strongly recommending a buyback exclusion. You cannot buy back your stock. You can’t take $1 billion of the money and just buy back your stock and increase the value. Please."
2020-03-21,45:11,Unnamed,"On the subject of masks, the vice president announced HHS was ordering a hundreds of millions of them. Was that order just placed today? How is that going to be distributed? And when can doctors and nurses expect to actually receive those masks?"
2020-03-21,45:24,Mike Pence,"Yeah. HHS is completing a half a billion dollar order of N95 masks and, all of this is being coordinated through FEMA and we are responding specifically to state requests where the needs arrive. As Dr. Fauci said, we want to make sure that people that are providing healthcare services to people who may have contracted coronavirus have the protection to keep themselves and their families healthy. But I want to emphasize, the supply of so-called N95 masks has been vastly increased."
2020-03-21,46:03,Mike Pence,"N-95 masks has been vastly increased in the country because the President insisted that we extend liability protection to industrial masks. What all the experts told us early on was that industrial mass that are used on construction sites, the President’s very familiar with from his past life, are perfectly appropriate to protect healthcare workers from respiratory illness. But they didn’t have the liability protection because they weren’t created for hospitals. We worked with leaders in both parties. We added that protection that runs through 2024 that now the industrial N-95 masks can be purchased by hospitals, purchased by states, purchased by HHS and distribute through our system. So we’re making those available. The supply has been, as I said, vastly increased and it’s another step forward and a bipartisan accomplishment and we’re continuing to use all the creative means of American industry to make sure that we’re leaning into this effort and that we do whatever it takes to make sure that our healthcare providers have the protective equipment they need."
2020-03-21,47:13,Unnamed,We are still hearing from doctors and nurses about the shortage. When exactly can they expect to receive these masks though?
2020-03-21,47:18,Mike Pence,"Well, let me let Pete Gaynor speak to that because FEMA will be, HHS is now fully integrated into FEMA and so as the requests come in, but obviously as I’m sure the administrator will say, they’re being prioritized to those areas with the highest need."
2020-03-21,47:35,Pete Gaynor,"Yes sir. So within the National Coordination Center, we have a supply chain task force. And in a basic sense we’re trying to identify the universe of what’s out there. So whether we hold it at the federal level, we hold it in the private sector and then match that up with demand and asking people to be creative. We’re asking, again, this is a shared responsibility. We’re asking locals and states to do your share locally, try to take a little bit of burden off of us and then we’ll prioritize those scarce resources because every single governor across the country is looking for the exact same thing."
2020-03-21,48:08,Pete Gaynor,"So there’s a balance, but we’re examining the entire supply chain to make sure that we make …"
2020-03-21,48:13,Donald Trump,When will the masks start coming in?
2020-03-21,48:16,Pete Gaynor,"They’re out there now. So again, we want to match, we want to get out of the middle I think."
2020-03-21,48:19,Donald Trump,Switch it.
2020-03-21,48:23,Unnamed,I appreciate that. [crosstalk 00:48:23]
2020-03-21,48:23,Pete Gaynor,So we’re trying to match suppliers with demand. So that’s what we’re doing right now. It’s happening today.
2020-03-21,48:28,Unnamed,They can expect them today or they’re matching supply and demand?
2020-03-21,48:32,Pete Gaynor,"There’s a range of requests across the country and we’re trying to match those again, supply and demand every day."
2020-03-21,48:41,Donald Trump,"We have a lot of them, a lot have already come in. I have to tell you, the throwing away of the mask being in private business, the throwing away the mask right away, they’re thrown away. And when you hear 55 million masks, what I’m saying, 55 million, how could it possibly be such a number? And they say, “Oh, that’s just a small fraction of what we need.” And I said, “Why aren’t we sanitizing masks?” You look at the mask, I’ve looked at all the different masks. Some don’t lend themselves to doing that, I think, but many do. And I said, “Why aren’t we …” We have very good liquids for doing this, sanitizing the masks. And that’s something they’re starting to do more and more. They’re sanitizing the masks and I don’t know if anybody who would like to speak to that."
2020-03-21,49:25,Donald Trump,You might want to just …
2020-03-21,49:27,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah. There are some CDC guidances about how you can minimize the use of masks by different things that you could do with testing and when you have masks, how you might reuse them, which ones you can reuse them."
2020-03-21,49:38,Unnamed,"Do you think there’s a solution to this, other than buying more masks, do healthcare providers need to change how they’re using them?"
2020-03-21,49:44,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, there are a couple of things. One, for example, we are moving towards getting testing where you don’t have to have PPE. I mean, I didn’t want to, I’m not going to tell you the day it’s going to be there, but it’s going to be a swab that you could stick in the nose of the person who is either infected or not, but that person doesn’t need PPE. The person who is administering the test. So if you could do a self administered test, stick it in a vial hand it over. You don’t need a mask, you don’t need PPE. That’s one of the things we’re trying to do."
2020-03-21,50:12,Donald Trump,"I would’ve liked that much better personally. Yeah, go ahead, Mike."
2020-03-21,50:15,Mike Pence,"May I? And one other, this is another story about great American industry. We the President and I literally heard directly from Apple that they’re donating 2 million industrial masks to this effort around the country and working with our administration to distribute those. And it might be a good opportunity for us to renew our call for, as the President and I delivered this message to businesses yesterday, manufacturers and small businesses. It’s a great time to go to your store room and if you have N-95 masks, if you’ve got a hundred of them, if you’ve got 10,000 of them, is to load them up, drive them over to your local hospital. That story is literally happening all over the country and now with more Americans stepping away from elective surgery, including elective dental care, we’re urging dentists around America to look at their supplies of N-95 masks and make those available to our hospitals."
2020-03-21,51:16,Mike Pence,"But the great news is as the President said, the American people are all doing this now. So allow me to say on behalf of the President, thank you for what you all are doing today, but we want to encourage people in business, encourage people in dentistry in particular. Look at those supplies of N-95 masks. Pack up as many as you can spare. Drop them off at your local hospital. It would be a great service to the country."
2020-03-21,51:41,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I just want to read you some of what some of the doctors on the front lines of this crisis are saying. A doctor …"
2020-03-21,51:48,Donald Trump,You mean the ones that are saying good things or bad things?
2020-03-21,51:50,Unnamed,"These are doctors who are talking about the shortage of medical supplies that they are facing. Dr. Faize Bucks in Kentucky says, “There’s absolutely no way to protect myself.” A surgeon in Fresno, California says, “We are at war with no ammo.” Dr. Mel in Illinois says, “If this is a wartime situation, then now is the time to act.” I know you’re talking now about increasing production at so many of these facilities to get the masks out. But given that this is one of the wealthiest, most powerful countries in the world, should this even be happening? Shouldn’t this have been resolved weeks ago?"
2020-03-21,52:20,Donald Trump,"Well, I’ll tell you the way I look at it. So many administrations proceeded me. For the most part, they did very little in terms of what you’re talking about. This is unprecedented. You could speak to Tony, you could speak to anybody. This is unprecedented or just about unprecedented. As time goes by, we’re seeing it’s really at a level that nobody would’ve believed. Nobody would have thought possible that this could happen and we are making much of this stuff now and much of it’s being delivered now."
2020-03-21,52:51,Donald Trump,"We’ve also gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people that can’t believe how fast it’s coming. When I hear they have an order of 55 million masks and that’s just one order, that’s one order at our many and that there are many millions of masks beyond that that are … and I keep saying, “How is it possible to use so much?” But that’s the way it is. And part of that is because they’ll use a mask for a short period of time and they throw it."
2020-03-21,53:17,Donald Trump,"The fact is that we are doing a tremendous amount. We started with very few masks. We had some, but nothing for an event like this, and now we’re making tens of millions of masks and other things and I think it’s unprecedented what we’ve done and what we’re doing and many doctors that I’ve read, many, many doctors, they can’t believe the great job that we’ve done."
2020-03-21,53:39,Donald Trump,"Yah, Kelly, did you have one?"
2020-03-21,53:41,Unnamed,"There has been many … Mr. President, it’s been more than three months since your administration learned about this, about this virus."
2020-03-21,53:47,Donald Trump,"Well, if you remember …"
2020-03-21,53:47,Unnamed,"So, why not sooner?"
2020-03-21,53:49,Donald Trump,"I was the one that closed the country down. I was the one that closed the … You don’t write that or you don’t say it too much. Certainly on CNN, but I just read an article yesterday. I just read an article yesterday that by closing the country down so early, very early, we saved tens of thousands and much more than that lives. So you might want to report that too."
2020-03-21,54:12,Brett Giroir,"I just like to address that for a moment. Again, I’m an ICU physician, ran health systems and I first of all want to thank everyone who’s on the front line in the emergency room, in the ICUs, in the hospitals. I speak to my colleagues daily. We need to preserve our PPE to the degree that we can. CDC guidelines has had that. The President has talked about it. But I also want to say we are making product as the President said, but we are also responding through the FEMA system to distribute the strategic national stockpile resources according to requests that come in. Stockpile has been distributed to many states, first order, second orders and on a daily basis adjudicating that. If there are shortages in your hospital system, I can’t tell you if Dr. X, Y, Z, that needs to be clearly iterated to the local emergency management."
2020-03-21,55:10,Unnamed,Are you seeing that happening? Are you seeing those hospitals talking about the [crosstalk 00:55:13].
2020-03-21,55:13,Brett Giroir,"We were on the phone two nights ago or three nights ago with over 2000 hospitals or hospital systems sharing best practices from Seattle where they’ve been very innovative, pioneering some of these areas. When there is a shortage, they need to go through their emergency management. It goes directly up to the FEMA system, which really rocks. It really works very, very well and then there’s the distribution of the stockpile. Now the stockpile isn’t infinite, that’s why it’s being replaced by all the orders. But, mask supplies go out on a daily basis as they are needed and requested through the FEMA system. And I don’t know, Administrator Gaynor, whether you want to add to that."
2020-03-21,55:52,Donald Trump,Tony?
2020-03-21,55:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Just to reiterate what Fred said. We don’t take lightly what you just read. I mean, I get the calls every night."
2020-03-21,56:04,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The way you get emails. It’s a serious issue. We don’t want that to happen, but it is happening. You’re not making things up. I know that because I’m experiencing it myself. But what you just heard about the different avenues, some of which aren’t even recognized, about how you can get help through the FEMA process in addition to the large amounts of additional PPE that’s coming into the system. We hope that very, very, very soon we’re not going to get those kinds of real life difficulties."
2020-03-21,56:35,Unnamed,"Sir, a matter of weeks …"
2020-03-21,56:35,Unnamed,"There’s a question about the timeline here, and even FEMA can’t quite answer sooner what the timeline is. Days, weeks?"
2020-03-21,56:43,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Sooner than weeks. It’s going to be days. I would hope, we’re going to try to make it days to the best possible way we can."
2020-03-21,56:53,Donald Trump,"And again, what we’re doing is we’re trying to help the states get things faster and that’s what we’re doing. We’re implementing. And the magnitude of this, it’s a tragedy. It’s an absolute tragedy, but the magnitude is something that no matter who you were, no matter where you come from, nobody ever thought a thing like this could happen. You read about 1917 and you read about certain things, but you think in a modern age, I thing like that could never happen."
2020-03-21,57:19,Donald Trump,"Well it comes back, it is genius. It comes back and it’s too bad. But I think the people working on this have been incredible. The job they’ve done has really been incredible. But there’s tremendous amounts of not only masks, of ventilators and respirators and everything you can think of. It’s all being much of it and almost, I could say all of it is being manufactured right now. Steve, please."
2020-03-21,57:44,Steve (Reporter),Yesterday there were questions about the use of this malaria drug. Have those questions now been resolved?
2020-03-21,57:49,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t know that resolved. I can say that it’s going to distributed. I know New York is getting I think 10,000 units and numerous other people. It’s really, it could be the malaria drug plus the Z-Pak. But, and we’re going to find out, we’re going to find out. I feel as the expression goes, what do we have to lose? Because I feel very good about it. Tony would feel, like he’d like samples done in a certain way and I understand that, too. Many doctors agree with that. We don’t have much time."
2020-03-21,58:27,Donald Trump,"We have a lot of very sick people right now in hospitals all over the place and speaking with the governor in New York, Cuomo, I said, “How’s it look?” He’s got a lot of sick people, so we’re going to be delivering a lot of samples to New York and other places and we’re going to find out very shortly whether or not it’s going to work. I feel very confident. I’ve seen things that surprise me frankly."
2020-03-21,58:52,Donald Trump,"There are, as Tony said, there are other things we’re looking at too. Vaccine of course is incredible, but this is more immediate. Right now, this to me would be the greatest thing that could happen. This would be a gift from heaven. This would be a gift from God if it works. So we’re going to pray to God that it does work. It’d be a fantastic thing."
2020-03-21,59:14,Kelly,"Mr President, Mr. President …"
2020-03-21,59:15,Donald Trump,"Yeah, in the back."
2020-03-21,59:16,Kelly,"On the economic front, there are reports that the coronavirus is really hurting your businesses, especially your hotels."
2020-03-21,59:23,Donald Trump,My businesses? Sure.
2020-03-21,59:24,Kelly,"Yeah, so is that true? And can you speak to financials?"
2020-03-21,59:26,Donald Trump,"Well, I wouldn’t say you’re thriving when you decide to close down your hotels and your businesses. No, I would say, I’m very under levered and everything, so that’s good. But is it hurting my … yeah. It’s hurting me and it’s hurting Hilton and it’s hurting all of the great hotel chains all over the world. It’s hurting everybody. I mean, there are very few businesses that are doing well now. There are some that are like as an example, the Walmarts of the world because everybody’s lined up to get things and stock up their house and this and that. But sure, it hurts my business."
2020-03-21,59:58,Kelly,And did you or anyone in your administration talk to anyone at the Trump organization about the potential effects of the coronavirus?
2020-03-21,01:00:04,Donald Trump,"No, I didn’t speak to anybody. I speak to my sons, but I talk about the coronavirus, but not as it pertains to my business. They basically follow the rules. When they say close them down in New York, we close them down or wherever they may be having. I actually have them all over the world and when they say, close them down, we close them down."
2020-03-21,01:00:23,Donald Trump,What Kelly?
2020-03-21,01:00:24,Kelly,Will you no longer go to Mar-a-Lago?
2020-03-21,01:00:25,Donald Trump,"Well, I have nothing planned at Mar-a-Lago. But right now I think Mar-a-Lago, I guess I haven’t even asked, but I imagine that’s closed down just like a lot of other businesses in Florida. Right?"
2020-03-21,01:00:37,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-03-21,01:00:38,Unnamed,Do you expect your family company to seek government assistance if it’s eligible?
2020-03-21,01:00:42,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. I just don’t know what the government assistance would be for what I have. I have hotels. Everybody knew I had hotels when I got elected. They knew I was a successful person when I got elected. So it’s one of those things, I guess I get paid $450,000 a year. I give it up, I put it back into the nation. I usually, I have to, by the way, you have to designate where you want it. So I oftentimes give it to opioid research and things."
2020-03-21,01:01:13,Donald Trump,"But as far as the hotels and everything, I have to do what everyone else is doing. I would probably decide to close things up. I think it’s a good thing. You don’t want people getting together and hotels and clubs and everything. You get together. We want to beat this deal. So I have many of them, hotels, clubs, things like that where people get together. I would think it would be a good practice to close them up."
2020-03-21,01:01:37,Donald Trump,"Yeah, go ahead, please."
2020-03-21,01:01:41,Unnamed,"Mr. President, as you know, we’ve been talking a lot about masks. We’ve also talked about how not everyone needs to take a test. What about a temperature test? As we know, we all came into this room and got tested before we entered."
2020-03-21,01:01:51,Donald Trump,"Well, I do it. I do it. I have temperature tests and I didn’t ask everybody here, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they had temperature tests. Otherwise, I’m going to run off the stage."
2020-03-21,01:02:02,Unnamed,"But should those thermometers and sensors have been distributed? Should they be on a mass distribution basis, too?"
2020-03-21,01:02:06,Donald Trump,"Oh, I think they are pretty much. The easiest thing is the temperature. I think they are. I don’t know. Are you learning a lot from the temperature tests, Tony? Could you maybe discuss that for a second?"
2020-03-21,01:02:15,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah, they have a place. They’re not infallible. There’s so many ways to get around that. Right now every time, certainly here we get, every time I go into a different room I got my temperature taken. But we see that on the outside that some people are doing that."
2020-03-21,01:02:29,Donald Trump,I took his temperature.
2020-03-21,01:02:32,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Very low. There is a role for it under certain circumstances. What I don’t see is a massive distribution of thermometers that are going to actually have a major impact on what I showed, what we need to do."
2020-03-21,01:02:46,Donald Trump,"And I’ve seen things when Tony mentions thermometers. They aim something at your forehead. They say this far away, boom, and they tell you what your temperature is. I said, “I’ve never seen that before.” I’ve learned a lot. I’ve learned a lot. It’s incredible. Go ahead in the back, the back corner."
2020-03-21,01:03:03,Unnamed,"[inaudible 01:03:03] with OEM, thank you. This morning, the Washington Post ran a story suggesting that you delayed taking action on the virus in January and February. Dr. Fauci has indicated that your action in the Chinese travel ban helped America immensely. What do you say to the Washington Post?"
2020-03-21,01:03:19,Donald Trump,"Well, I love whoever you’re with that’s because I think that’s such a nice, that’s such a nice question. No, I think the Washington Post covers us very inaccurately. Covers me very inaccurately. I saw this story. I think it’s a disgrace, but it’s the Washington Post and I guess we have to live with it. It’s a very, it’s a very inaccurate, quiet, quiet. It’s a very inaccurate story. From many people, I get a lot of credit for having closed our country very early to a very heavily infected country, China. Unfortunately, China, I wish China would have told us more about what was going on in China long prior to us reading about it. Even though the news isn’t exactly disseminated. As you know, China kicked the Washington Post out of China and they kicked the New York Times out of China and I guess the Wall Street Journal."
2020-03-21,01:04:09,Donald Trump,"That’s okay. I mean that’s what they do and I think it’s a terrible thing they did. But I also think it’s terrible when people write inaccurately about you and they write inaccurately about me every single day, every single hour. And by the way, your group really, I really think, and I just say fair, not good or bad, I think you write very fairly and do very fair reports about the great job that all of us are doing. That this group behind me is doing. It’s so insulting when they write phony stories that they know are fake news because they’re not insulting me. They’re insulting everybody. These incredible people that have worked so hard, so long that are thinking about nothing other than this invisible enemy. They have done such an incredible job. And they will continue and we’re going to win and there’ll be a lot of celebration when we win and we’re going to win with as few lives lost as possible."
2020-03-21,01:05:01,Donald Trump,"That’s the game. Win with as few lives lost as possible. It’s a tough enemy. It’s a tough killer, far bigger, far more vicious than ever before. But I appreciate you saying it because the fact that we closed so early to China and most people …Hey look, I was called xenophobic by sleepy Joe Biden. I was called a racist by Democrats. A racist. I was a racist because I decided that I didn’t want to have people that could hurt our country come in, and I was pretty much in a very small group of people. I will tell you, it was a tiny little group. Most people even that worked in the White House disagreed with me very strongly."
2020-03-21,01:05:42,Donald Trump,"Saving of those many weeks was a tremendous thing and where they keep talking about acting early, that was the ultimate act. That was the biggest act because we didn’t, and then I also closed Europe early, very early and I took a lot of heat for that too, but that was a good thing. Now they’re doing similar things that we’re doing. So I didn’t act late. I acted early. I acted far before anybody thought I should be. I took tremendous criticism from the various papers, from many of the papers. So I very much appreciate the question."
2020-03-21,01:06:14,Donald Trump,"It might’ve been more of a statement that a question. But whatever it may have been, I appreciate it very much."
2020-03-21,01:06:22,Unnamed,"So a number of the states have done these different measures. We’ve seen California order one thing, New York do something similar. Do you want all of the states to do one uniform …"
2020-03-21,01:06:30,Donald Trump,"No. No. They can do what they want to do. If California can get a mask sooner than we can get it for them through all of the things we’re able to do and we we’re going to end up with a big oversupply at some point. At some point this is going away and we’re going to end up with a big oversupply and you know what, in this case that’s going to be okay."
2020-03-21,01:06:49,Donald Trump,"But if California, if Gavin can go out and order gowns faster or masks, good masks faster or other things faster, that’s good. We do have a lot of … The coordination with the ships that we’re sending in, as you know, the medical ships that we’re sending in and even cruise liners. We’re going to be sending in probably cruise liners into some areas in particular California and in particular New York. But if somebody can do something faster, if they can order that mask faster than us, I want them to be able to do it."
2020-03-21,01:07:21,Unnamed,"I was talking about the rules, sir. Some people can’t leave their homes in certain businesses …"
2020-03-21,01:07:24,Donald Trump,We coordinate very much with them. Yes.
2020-03-21,01:07:26,Unnamed,You don’t want all those to be the same. You want …
2020-03-21,01:07:28,Donald Trump,"Well, it doesn’t have to be at this moment because we have places in the country where, states where they have two people, or three people and those people are in quarantine and you can’t put on them what you’re putting in New York where you do have a tremendous problem. We have large portions of the country, middle America where they have a few people. So it may be a time, I hope that never happens where we need to take very drastic action. But right now that’s not in the same ballpark. Yeah, go ahead, please."
2020-03-21,01:07:57,Unnamed,We’re at day six into your 15 days of recommendations.
2020-03-21,01:08:00,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-21,01:08:00,Unnamed,A lot of people are following them. Some people are not. Do you think the American people are doing enough right now to slow this virus down?
2020-03-21,01:08:05,Donald Trump,"I think they are, and some people are not. But, I think they are. I think it’s going to have a very profound effect. We’ll know a little bit more on day 14 and 15 and we’ll see."
2020-03-21,01:08:15,Unnamed,What’s the plan once we get to the end?
2020-03-21,01:08:16,Donald Trump,"Well we’re going to see. We have to see what the result is. We want to flatten that out and we’re going to see what the result is. And I just want to say, I’m going to negotiate a very large transaction and I’ve been negotiating it for two days. So I’m going to take one or two more questions and then I’m going to leave it to Vice President Pence."
2020-03-21,01:08:34,Donald Trump,"On the Hill, with the Hill, the various elements of the package. Steve, go ahead."
2020-03-21,01:08:39,Steve (Reporter),A number of groups are calling for the postponement or cancellation of the Olympics. Have you given any [crosstalk 00:22:44].
2020-03-21,01:08:43,Donald Trump,"No, no I haven’t. Look, we understand the difficulty of that and he’s a very good friend of mine. You take a look at Shinzo Abe. He’s a great gentleman. He loves his country. We have an incredible relationship. We just finished a trade deal with them, $40 billion trade deal with Japan."
2020-03-21,01:09:03,Donald Trump,"We just finished a trade deal with them, 40 billion dollar trade deal with Japan, and Prime Minister Abe has a big decision to make. They have built one of the most beautiful venues I’ve ever seen. They’re all ready to go. It’s not late. It’s not over budget. It was just done flawlessly, and it’s beautiful, and they’re sitting back and saying … I told them. I said “That’s your decision.” And it is his decision, and I know he’s going to make it soon. I don’t know what it’s going to be, and I didn’t think I should be influencing it at all."
2020-03-21,01:09:31,Donald Trump,"I mean, the job that Japan has done on that venue is incredible. So there are options, obviously, including delay, and maybe delay for next year, but that’s totally up to them. We’ll see what they do."
2020-03-21,01:09:42,Steve (Reporter),"Since this story keeps popping up, when did you first learn that this was going to be a problem?"
2020-03-21,01:09:52,Donald Trump,"When I learned I started doing the closing, so probably around that time. We didn’t learn much. I think you’re going to ask a little bit about China responsibility. I do think that, again, I have great respect for China. I like China. I think the people of China are incredible. I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi. I wish they could’ve told us earlier about what was going on inside. We didn’t know about it until it started coming out publicly, but I wish they could’ve told us earlier about it, because we could’ve come up with a solution."
2020-03-21,01:10:25,Donald Trump,"Tony Fauci, and all of the people, the talent that we have would’ve loved to of had three or four months of additional time if you knew that this was going to be happening."
2020-03-21,01:10:36,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Of course.
2020-03-21,01:10:37,Donald Trump,"They didn’t have that time. They read about it in the newspapers like everybody else. China was very secretive. Okay? Very, very secretive. And that’s unfortunate. With that, I have great respect for that country. I have great respect for the leader of that country, and like him. He’s a friend of mine. But I wish they would’ve told us earlier, Steve, that they were having a problem, because they were having a big problem, and they knew it."
2020-03-21,01:11:04,Donald Trump,"And I wish they could’ve given us an advanced warning, because we could’ve had a lot of things, as an example, some of the things that we’re talking about where we order them as quickly as we can. If we had a two or three month difference in time it would’ve been much better."
2020-03-21,01:11:19,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-03-21,01:11:20,Unnamed,Can I follow up on that?
2020-03-21,01:11:20,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-21,01:11:21,Unnamed,"Because as you were saying China was extremely secretive about this. Several of your advisors have been critical of China. Secretary Pompeo was talking about it yesterday, and he had been saying so for quite some time. So why then on January 24th did you Tweet that “China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus, that the United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency?”"
2020-03-21,01:11:43,Donald Trump,Because it’s true.
2020-03-21,01:11:44,Unnamed,“It will all work out well.” Why were you Tweeting that then?
2020-03-21,01:11:44,Donald Trump,Because it’s true. China has worked very hard. China has lost thousands and thousands of people.
2020-03-21,01:11:51,Unnamed,"You said they were transparent, right?"
2020-03-21,01:11:51,Donald Trump,No. They weren’t transparent. They were transparent at that time. But when we saw what happened they could’ve been transparent much earlier than they were.
2020-03-21,01:11:58,Unnamed,That was a month after China [crosstalk 01:12:00].
2020-03-21,01:11:59,Donald Trump,Just so you understand. China’s not a beneficiary here. China has lost thousands and thousands of people. China has gone through hell over this. They’ve gone through hell. And I’ve had conversations with President Xi. I just wish they could’ve told us earlier. They knew they had a problem earlier. I wish they could’ve said that.
2020-03-21,01:12:16,Unnamed,But this was a month after [inaudible 01:12:18].
2020-03-21,01:12:19,Unnamed,Thank you for the numbers on the testing by the way.
2020-03-21,01:12:20,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-03-21,01:12:21,Unnamed,"Are you going to share any other hard numbers on the number of available tests, on number of ventilators in the federal stockpile?"
2020-03-21,01:12:27,Donald Trump,"I’m going to leave that up to Dr. Fauci and everybody else, and I think the answer is we want to share them. I would imagine we want to share the numbers. Admiral, do you want to discuss that?"
2020-03-21,01:12:35,Unnamed,The 500 billion masks that you cited they’re due for delivery in 18 months.
2020-03-21,01:12:38,Donald Trump,"Half a billion, no, not billion."
2020-03-21,01:12:40,Unnamed,500 million masks.
2020-03-21,01:12:40,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-21,01:12:40,Unnamed,"Excuse me, thank you."
2020-03-21,01:12:41,Donald Trump,"I said, wait a minute."
2020-03-21,01:12:42,Unnamed,"Half a billion masks, they’re due for delivery according to HHS within 18 months. The last number of ventilators we had was 12 to 13000. Can you give us an updated number on that?"
2020-03-21,01:12:51,Donald Trump,"There’s never been numbers like this. A ventilator is a machine. It’s a very complex machine and to think that we have to order hundreds of thousands nobody’s every heard of a thing like this. We had thousands in a stockpile. Thousands ready to go. That’s a lot. All of a sudden you need hundreds of thousands. The mask is … Whether it’s plastic, or whether it’s material, that’s one thing, but you’re talking about a very sophisticated heavily computerized machine, and delicate, and you need hundreds of thousands of them. Nobody’s ever heard of a thing like that."
2020-03-21,01:13:28,Donald Trump,"With that being said General Motors, Ford, so many companies … I had three calls yesterday directly. Without having to institute like “You will do this” these companies are making them right now. But to think of these numbers it’s pretty mind-boggling."
2020-03-21,01:13:42,Unnamed,Do you have numbers to share right now? Do you have numbers to share with us right now on stockpile?
2020-03-21,01:13:47,Donald Trump,"Michael, please."
2020-03-21,01:13:49,Mike Pence,"Yeah, you bet. We spoke a lot about mass this morning but the president’s also given the task force a priority of assessing the availability, and expanding the availability of ventilators, and on Monday we will detail some very encouraging news for Americans. You speak about the number of 13000. It is a little more than that, that we have in the national stockpile, but it’s important to remember that doesn’t include more than 100000 ventilators that are in healthcare facilities and hospitals around America today. It doesn’t include what will be produced. As the president said we’re seeing companies step forward. These manufacturers tell us that a ventilator actually isn’t a very complicated piece of equipment, and many of them are literally surging forward to create more ventilators. But one of the more exciting developments in the last week, which we’ll detail more on Monday, is that in the president’s engagement with our healthcare community we learned that ventilators that are currently used by anesthesiologist, that are used in outpatient clinics, and other procedures can be converted to be used as ventilators for people struggling with the effects of the coronavirus."
2020-03-21,01:15:14,Mike Pence,"We’ve confirmed that a particular screen in that device can be changed readily. We’re working with the FDA to approve that. But again, it’s a great testament of the American people and our healthcare professionals that are stepping forward and bringing ideas forward that literally, as we’ll document Monday, will increase the supply of ventilators by tens of thousands. But look, the president’s made it clear. We want to make sure that all the incredible courageous men and women who are serving in healthcare around America have the support they need, that our patients that are struggling with recovering from coronavirus have the equipment they need."
2020-03-21,01:15:57,Mike Pence,We’ll have a lot of detail on Monday as we continue to assess.
2020-03-21,01:16:02,Unnamed,"You said eight days ago that we would have 1.4 million tests onboard by the end of this week, by today. Do we have that? Can you give us a number that we have?"
2020-03-21,01:16:08,Mike Pence,Let me let Admiral Giroir speak to that.
2020-03-21,01:16:10,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-03-21,01:16:11,Brett Giroir,"So I’m going to answer your question and then try to persuade you to stop asking a specific number, okay? So from March 2nd to March 14th we have put over 10 million laboratory tests into the US commercial market, and we expect that by March 28th to be well over 27 million into the market. So that answers your question, and let me tell you why it’s not the right question. Not every lab can run every test. Not every test is completely self-contained. So the more important question is not how many tests are in the market, we’ve got them in the market, but it’s to make sure that every segment of the market has the kind of test that they can use."
2020-03-21,01:16:53,Kelly,"Admiral, we’re using your numbers-"
2020-03-21,01:16:54,Unnamed,That’s right.
2020-03-21,01:16:55,Kelly,-trying to find out for the public if the things you’ve promised are happening.
2020-03-21,01:16:59,Brett Giroir,"Yes, they are happening. We promised one, or four million, there’s 10 million tests in the market now."
2020-03-21,01:17:05,Kelly,And are the masks that are in the strategic reserve being deployed Mr. Vice President?
2020-03-21,01:17:10,Brett Giroir,"Yes, the masks in the strategic national stockpile-"
2020-03-21,01:17:13,Kelly,So it’s not 13000 anymore. It would be a lower number. Would that be fair to say?
2020-03-21,01:17:16,Brett Giroir,Masks?
2020-03-21,01:17:18,Kelly,"No, the ventilators. I’m sorry, the respirators."
2020-03-21,01:17:24,Kelly,We’re trying to understand if the things we have been told sitting through these briefings for many days are happening and getting into the hands of the healthcare providers.
2020-03-21,01:17:34,Donald Trump,You understand it. You understand it.
2020-03-21,01:17:37,Kelly,We’re trying to get an answer.
2020-03-21,01:17:38,Donald Trump,"You’re an intelligent woman, Kelly. You understand exactly what he’s saying, and what he’s saying is rather incredible, because we inherited an obsolete broken system, and when you hear the number of tests that we’ll be providing, and are now, it’s incredible. I’ve heard a lot of governors say the same thing. We took over an obsolete broken testing system that wouldn’t of worked for even a small problem let alone one of the biggest pandemics in history."
2020-03-21,01:18:01,Donald Trump,"And what these gentleman have done is incredible. I am going now to negotiate a great deal for our workers and our citizens. I’ll be back tomorrow. We’re probably doing this tomorrow, and if I might I’d like to ask Vice President Pence to take over, and thank you all very much."
2020-03-21,01:18:16,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-21,01:18:18,Kelly,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-21,01:18:20,Mike Pence,Thank you all. How about back here.
2020-03-21,01:18:23,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President. The military has sent planes to Honduras, Morocco, and Peru to pick up Americans and bring them home who have been stranded there, but there’re still a lot of other Americans who are stranded and can’t get home, so does the military plan to send planes to pick those folks up? Where will those planes be going? When will they be going? And can you assure Americans that who are stranded in foreign countries that they will be able to get back?"
2020-03-21,01:18:47,Mike Pence,"We received a briefing this morning from the State Department about their efforts, and we want to be very clear, while the president has suspended all travel from Europe, including the UK and Ireland, suspended all travel of course from China since January, any American who can get home can come home. They’ll go through additional screening. That’s all been implemented, and is working in an orderly way at a number of airports around the country."
2020-03-21,01:19:18,Mike Pence,"But there are instances, Morocco being among them, where there simply are not flights to get home. Our State Department has been working very closely with our embassies in those relevant countries. I was told this morning that all the way going back to bringing Americans back from China that we have made individual efforts to bring home about 3000 Americans. I think there is an ongoing effort to address that with chartered commercial flights that the government is providing, obviously, also military transport is available. Our task force received a briefing this morning and we would just encourage any American that’s looking on from overseas contact the local US embassy, let them know about your circumstances, and know that we’re going to continue to work very diligently to get our Americans home."
2020-03-21,01:20:15,Unnamed,"All right, guys, last question."
2020-03-21,01:20:17,Unnamed,Two quick ones. Education and a medication one.
2020-03-21,01:20:21,Unnamed,You guys have announced that standardized testing is essentially canceled in this country.
2020-03-21,01:20:26,Mike Pence,Yes.
2020-03-21,01:20:26,Unnamed,"To the tens of millions of students out there, their teachers, and their parents who are sort of scratching their head wondering what does that mean, obviously, a lot of this is driven by local school districts, by the state, is there any federal guidance on this, and if not today could you have Secretary DeVos or somebody come and explain that to the millions who are literally sitting at home trying to figure out what exactly that means?"
2020-03-21,01:20:50,Mike Pence,"I think it’s a terrific question, and we will bring Secretary Betsy DeVos here tomorrow or on Monday to address our efforts. The objective here was as people are embracing the president’s 15 days to slow the spread we have decisions by local school boards, and local, and state officials that have canceled school or suspended school for a time, and we wanted the Federal Department of Education to make it clear that the burden of standardizing testing, which back in my days as governor I remember takes a number of days, and sometimes up to a week to administer, is not going to be placed on schools. We’ll have the secretary here to address that very specifically, and it’s a very good point on your part."
2020-03-21,01:21:39,Unnamed,"I mentioned I had a medication question, and I wanted to ask it while the president was here, because earlier he Tweeted that there were two certain medications that when taken together quote “Have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine” and that they should be quote “Put in use immediately.” Since he’s not here I can’t ask him what he meant, but I’m wondering if Dr. Fauci or the admiral could clarify if you have any sense of what he was talking about, and whether his 74 and a half million Twitter followers should be taking medical advice from him or from someone else."
2020-03-21,01:22:20,Mike Pence,"The president brought together the top pharmaceutical companies in America and in the world a number of weeks ago, and they formed a consortium to work on a range of responses beginning with therapeutics which for a layman like me that just means medicine to make you feel better. They’re already going to work on that. We actually think, Dr. Fauci, I think there’s some sense that our great pharmaceutical companies may actually be producing therapeutics that will give relief to Americans struggling with coronavirus as soon as this spring. We also challenged them to work together as rapidly possible to develop a vaccine going forward."
2020-03-21,01:23:05,Mike Pence,"And as Dr. Fauci has indicated we brought a vaccine to clinical trials now the better part of a week ago, the fastest time in history. Now, it’s the first phase of the trials and people should understand, as our health experts have described, they’ll be a period of as much as a year and a half before we can make those vaccines available. But as the president said at this podium there is some anecdotal evidence that several existing medicines may have brought relief to patients struggling in China, and in Europe, and the president has tasked the FDA to work very rapidly to allow what’s called off-label use for those."
2020-03-21,01:23:54,Mike Pence,"One is a malaria medicine. This morning I think the president reiterated the hopefulness he feels about this, that because these are medications that are time honored, and tested, they’ve been taken for many, many years, that we want to pursue, number one, making those available. If someone’s doctor believes that it’s appropriate the doctor would be able to prescribe that medicine even though that’s not indicated."
2020-03-21,01:24:24,Mike Pence,"That’s called an off-label use. But the other piece is, as Dr. Fauci said, and I’ll yield to him, in deploying those medicines we’re working specifically with one state to do so in a way that represents a clinical trial, so it would not just be compassionate use, which the medicines are already being used in some jurisdictions today, but also we could study it and determine the viability of it."
2020-03-21,01:24:56,Mike Pence,"And in fact, we’re working diligently right now with that supply chain to make sure that those medicines are available. Dr. Fauci, did you want to speak to that?"
2020-03-21,01:25:04,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Sure. It’s essentially what I said multiple times from this podium, is that when you have … First of all, we’re trying to develop de novo drugs that are not yet out there, not approved, that ultimately would be effective, and the way you prove that is to do a randomized control trial to prove safety and efficacy. I’m not totally sure what the president was referring to, but I believe he’s referring to a report that used both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin together to have some possibility of being an effect."
2020-03-21,01:25:39,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Many of the things that you hear out there are what I had called anecdotal reports. They may be true, but they’re anecdotal, so the only thing that I was saying is that if you really wanted to definitively know if something works that you’ve got to do the kind of trial that you get the good information. The president is talking about hope for people, and it’s not an unreasonable thing to hope for people, so when you have approved drugs that physicians have the option, and a decision between the physician and the patient, are you going to use a drug that someone says from an anecdotal standpoint, not completely proven, but might have some effect? There are those who lean to the point of giving hope and saying give that person the option of having access to that drug, and then you have the other group, which is my job as a scientist to say my job is to ultimately prove without a doubt that a drug is not only safe, but that it actually works."
2020-03-21,01:26:38,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Those two things are really not incompatible when you think about that, particularly when you’re in an arena where you don’t have anything that’s proven. We went through the same sort of thing with a little bit of a different twist during the HIV/AIDS epidemic until we finally developed drugs that were absolutely knockout drugs that were safe and that were effective. But in the beginning there was that tension about that, so you’ve really got to have a balance. I’ve got to do my job as a scientist, and others have other things to do."
2020-03-21,01:27:06,Mike Pence,"Great. Let me just, if I may, let me just say I hope this morning has been informative. We will be back again tomorrow. And I hope the American people are encouraged because of the incredible whole of government approach because of our collaboration with states. You’re seeing testing expanded all across the country, that incredible public/private partnership with commercial labs is not making testing available by the tens of thousands. We’re working very diligently with an incredible response from American industry to make sure that personal protective equipment, ventilators, and all the things that our healthcare providers need to meet this moment is there."
2020-03-21,01:27:51,Mike Pence,"But let me just say, again, what every American can do today, and that is first and foremost heed your state and local authorities. They’re individual states, California, Washington State, and at this moment especially New York that have issued guidance to their citizens, and as the president said we wholly support the leadership that those governors are providing in their states."
2020-03-21,01:28:19,Mike Pence,"But secondly, every single American can put into practice the principles of our 15 days to slow the spread. The president’s coronavirus guidelines, as I said, we are six days in, and the purpose of these is not because every American is at risk of serious illness. As we said before, all our experts tell us, all the data shows, that the risk of serious illness to the average American remains low, but because the coronavirus is, we think, three times more contagious than the flu to slow the spread, to literally lower that curve, and spare Americans around our country with being exposed to, or contracting, the coronavirus, or worse every single one of us can put these principles into practice."
2020-03-21,01:29:13,Mike Pence,"I recommend that you go to Coronavirus.gov, sit your family down, call a neighbor and a friend, support efforts in your local community to put these principles into practice. And as people all across this country continue to do just that I just know we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this together. Thank you all."
2020-03-21,01:29:38,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Thank you."
2020-03-21,01:29:44,Kelly,"Thank you, sir."
2020-03-21,01:29:44,Unnamed,"Kelly, what did you say?"
2020-03-21,01:29:44,Kelly,"Sorry for your loss, referring to our colleague."
2020-03-22,00:56,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Just before we begin, I want to mention we’re working very hard, long on getting a young group of people out of Peru. We’ve removed some and the rest are being removed with the cooperation of the Peruvian government. And we’re also dealing with Honduras on getting some people out that got caught up. And we are working in that very well again with the Honduran government’s work. And they’re working with us, so I appreciate that."
2020-03-22,01:38,Donald Trump,"We have a couple of other locations that will report to you and we were able to get a young woman released from a certain area who was being a horribly accosted, horribly treated. And we spoke to General Milley. General Milley took care of it. We went in and we got her out. And we’ll report further on that one, but it’s, that was rough stuff. I want to thank General Milley. I want to thank all of the people that were involved and the people that went in to get her. I want to thank you very much."
2020-03-22,02:18,Donald Trump,"As we continue to marshal every resource at America’s disposal in the fight against the Chinese virus, we were profoundly grateful to our nation, state and local leaders, doctors, nurses, law enforcement and first responders who are waging this battle on the ground. It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government’s guidelines. So important about social distancing, non-essential travel, and hand-washing. Defeating this unseen enemy requires the help and commitment of every single American."
2020-03-22,02:55,Donald Trump,"I want to just say that Senator Rand Paul, a friend of mine, he’s been a great friend of mine. He’s been always there when we needed him, when the country needed him, and as you know, he just tested positive. Jose Diaz-Balart, I spoke to him yesterday, tested positive. And some people are getting quite close to home. And it’s a terrible thing that’s going on, the hidden enemy. I call it the hidden enemy. And I think they’ll all be fine. I hope they’re going to be fine. But I just want to send our regards. And I think I can speak on behalf of our country to those two great friends of mine."
2020-03-22,03:39,Donald Trump,"We’re working urgently with Congress on legislation to support the millions of workers, small businesses and industries who’ve been hit hard by the virus through no fault of their own. Our goal is to get relief to Americans as quickly as possible so that families can get by and small businesses can keep workers on the payroll. This will help our economy and you will see our economy skyrocket once this is over. I think it’s going to skyrocket. It’s a pent up demand. It’s a built up demand. And I guess you really have to say who knows, but I think it’s going to be a tremendous day when we win this war. And we will win the war."
2020-03-22,04:24,Donald Trump,"We want to win the war was with his few, if you look at it, just deaths as possible. We want to have as few number of deaths as possible. Today I’m announcing action to help New York, California, and Washington ensure that the national guard can effectively respond to this crisis. The national guard, these are tremendous people. They’re fully on alert. We’ve signed what we had to sign. And it’s been activated."
2020-03-22,04:54,Donald Trump,"We’re dealing also with other states. These states have been hit the hardest actually pretty much by far you could say the hardest. Everybody can see that. Just look at the numbers. And through FEMA, the federal government will be funding 100% of the cost of deploying national guard units to carry out approved missions to stop the virus while those governors remain in command. So the governors locally are going to be in command and we’ll be following them. And we hope they can do the job and I think they will."
2020-03-22,05:25,Donald Trump,I spoke with all three of the governors today and just a little while ago. And they’re very happy with what we’re going to be doing because we will be announcing some other things for those three states and some other states where it’s a hit the hardest.
2020-03-22,05:44,Donald Trump,"This actually will give them maximum flexibility to use the guard against the virus without having to worry about cost or liability. And freeing up state resources to protect the health and safety of the people in their state. The federal government has deployed hundreds of tons of supplies from our national stockpile to locations with the greatest need in order to assist in those areas. I approved the state of New York’s request for a major disaster declaration, something which Governor Cuomo has been asking for and which I agree. And we had it done in very rapid fashion."
2020-03-22,06:21,Donald Trump,"We approved this on Friday evening. And we are working very, very hard to get all of these things not only signed up but completed and finished and win. The requests from the state of Washington for a major disaster declaration was approved just a little while ago. Went through the process and we moved it very quickly. The request from the state of California was just received and we will have it approved very quickly. We’ll be working, I told that to Gavin Newsome. And we’re working on getting that done very quickly. It’ll be done maybe tonight. We have large quantities of medical equipment and supplies on the way based on all of this to those states including respirators, surgical masks and gowns, face shields, coveralls and gloves with large quantities already delivered to Washington and to New York. In addition to large quantities of supplies, I’ve also directed FEMA to supply the following, four large federal medical stations with 1000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1000 beds for the state of Washington. The governors know."
2020-03-22,07:46,Donald Trump,"The supplies in route to California in New York will be delivered within the next 48 hours. In addition, the Naval hospital ship, the USNS Mercy, it’s incredible ships. These two ships are incredible. One on the West coast, one on the East coast will be deployed to Los Angeles to add emergencies, surge medical capacity, and they have a tremendous capacity. They are really something. I will say that if you look at some of the things we’ve been doing and now those numbers have gone up, and just to be a little bit more exacting, we’ve done a presidential approval for requests for major disaster declaration for the state of New York, approval of Title 32 national guard activation for the state of New York. We’re providing all of this at no cost to the governor. I spoke with Governor Cuomo. He’s working hard, we’re all working hard together. The relationship is really been amazing."
2020-03-22,08:48,Donald Trump,"But it also enables the governor to provide robust national guard support to the state and the 25%, we’re going to be waving that 25% cost. We’re picking up, we’ll be coordinating. And they’ll be doing something with very special people. Mission assignment of the US army Corps of engineers to provide support to build out alternate care sites. They’re doing various alternate care sites which have now been designated by New York, four large federal medical stations of 1000 beds. These are very complex places actually with great equipment and great people. Strategic national stockpile order and this is as of a number of days ago, so far delivered to New York and this is the 19th, we had the N95 respirators, 186,416 delivered. We’ve delivered 444,000 O78 surgical masks, many have been delivered since then. Face shields, we’ve delivered 84,560 face shields, surgical gowns 68,944 to New York, coveralls 352, gloves 245,486."
2020-03-22,10:19,Donald Trump,"Also to New York in terms of what’s been delivered just since then. The numbers are quite large and we have tremendous numbers of companies also making equipment for the state of Washington. We’ve delivered 369,000 N95 respirators, 507,406 surgical masks. This is as of about three days ago. Face shields 63,788 face shields, surgical gowns 107,850, gloves 240,376 and we have many, many things pending. It’s actually not pending. They’re being fabricated, they’re being made. And they’re moving."
2020-03-22,11:15,Donald Trump,"Now for Washington, so we have four small federal medical stations 250 beds, and for Washington, state of Washington, we have three large federal medical stations 750 beds. And then you have, as I said, the approval of the Title 32 national guard."
2020-03-22,11:35,Donald Trump,"State of California, again, to be very precise, we’re going to have the approval of the Title 32 national guard activation. And we’re providing all of this again, like in New York, at no cost to the governor, meaning to Governor Newsome, and the state, no cost to the state. It enables the governor to provide robust national guard support to the state, so they’re going to have control of the national guard. Federal government’s sending, these are incredible people that are being sent."
2020-03-22,12:08,Donald Trump,"We have eight large federal medical stations with over 2000 beds and that’s going to California and then strategic national stack pile order. We’ve ordered likewise hundreds of thousands of different items, won’t go into the exact numbers but the numbers are very substantial, but we’re having tremendous additional numbers sent. And whatever the states can get, they should be getting."
2020-03-22,12:34,Donald Trump,"I say we’re sort of a backup for the states. And some of the states are doing really well and some don’t do as well. The ones that don’t do as well need more help. But these are three states that really do need help because they are hit very hard. And the outpouring from the private sector has also been extraordinary. I’m pleased to report that Honeywell, great company, has just announced it will immediately expand its personal protective equipment manufacturing operations in Rhode Island to produce millions of additional N95 masks. They’re very hard to get, they’re actually quite complex, for the US government strategic national stockpile. They’ll be immediately then delivered to the various states. This expansion is already underway and it’s going to provide a lot of jobs for that state, probably around 500."
2020-03-22,13:29,Donald Trump,"The masks will be distributed by the government for the use of the health, safety, and emergency, and this for response workers, primarily for response workers. These are very high end. This expansion is in addition to Honeywell’s action to more than double production of its existing personal protective equipment manufacturing plants. They make a lot of different things and they’re doubling and tripling their production. They’re going round the clock."
2020-03-22,13:56,Donald Trump,"Today, I’m also announcing the launch of a new public private consortium organized by the White House, the Department of Energy, and IBM to unleash the power of American super computing resources to fight the Chinese virus. The following leaders from private industries, academia and government will be contributing. And they’re going to be contributing a lot of different things, but primarily computing resources to help researchers discover new treatments and vaccines. There’ll be working along with NIH and all of the people that are working on this. But tremendous help from IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, MIT, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Department of Energy’s national labor laboratories, the National Science Foundation and NASA. They’re all contributing to this effort. And they’re fully in gear."
2020-03-22,14:56,Donald Trump,"This afternoon, I also want to update you on the steps we’re taking to protect and serve our country’s 18 million veterans. These are great people. Our amazing veterans have shown their eternal loyalty to our nation and this is the time where they’re in need and we are going to show our loyalty to them. We’re being very protective of our veterans. We’re working on certain hospitals where we may be doing some work in Louisiana in particular and some other states, veterans hospitals. We’re going to be very protective of our veterans. Some of them are of that very vulnerable age. And some of them obviously are not feeling well. And some of them are still suffering the wounds of war from many years ago."
2020-03-22,15:43,Donald Trump,"Yesterday I signed vital legislation to ensure that the GI bill will cover distance learning during this emergency. I also spoke with many of our veteran service organizations or the VSOs to describe our unprecedented action. In February, the department of veterans affairs established 19 emergency operation centers throughout the country. One of the things that they’ve been trying to get done for many years, you all know this from following me over the last number of years, but we got it done pretty quickly. They’ve been trying to get it done for many, many decades was choice, veteran’s choice and also veterans accountability."
2020-03-22,16:26,Donald Trump,"Now if it’s crowded within this, if they can’t get to a doctor, we have great doctors in the VA. I have to say that. We have fantastic doctors as good as they come. But it’s hard to get to them because of what was bureaucracy, but no longer bureaucracy. We’ve done a lot of things in that case because of accountability. When people aren’t doing their jobs or if they’re bad or if they’re sadistic or if they steal or anything bad happens, we’re now allowed to fire them for, I signed that a year and a half ago. For many years you weren’t able to do this."
2020-03-22,16:59,Donald Trump,"So the VA is working and I was just told by our great leader at the VA, Robert Wilkie, he said for the first time we get the highest marks in the history, highest poll numbers in the history of the veteran’s administration came out a week ago that they’re happy. And look, one of the reasons that happened, highest in history, one of the reasons that happened is because of veteran’s choice. If they have to wait in line, they go and see a private doctor and we pay the bill. And they get better."
2020-03-22,17:36,Donald Trump,"They don’t have to wait two weeks and three weeks or two days. But they get better. And a lot of times they waited so long that they would have a problem and it would end up being terminal because they couldn’t get the kind of treatment that they deserve. So highest poll numbers, highest approval numbers in the history of the VA. I was just given that information yesterday."
2020-03-22,17:59,Donald Trump,"We restricted visitors access to 135 veteran community living centers, which has nearly 8,000 veterans with chronic medical conditions so that we limit their exposure to the virus. We want to totally take care of our veterans and that’s what we’re doing. The VA has canceled most elective medical and surgical procedures. They’re delaying them until after this has gone, after we’ve won. We began providing lifesaving care to patients who had symptoms across the 171 VA medical centers nationwide, that’s a big deal."
2020-03-22,18:41,Donald Trump,"Under my administration, the VA has also been a leader in expanding telehealth. Telehealth is becoming a bigger and bigger factor in medicine. This month we’ve taken bold action to cut through the red tape and make telehealth available for millions more Americans during this crisis. They can speak to a doctor from the safety of their home rather than risk becoming infected, or making a tremendously long trip, when frankly you’ll speak to a great doctor right from your home. It’s happening, telehealth. We’re very much at the forefront of that too. We’re very proud of it. And it also takes a big burden off our system."
2020-03-22,19:19,Donald Trump,"We continue to accelerate the development of safe and effective vaccines. We’re also aggressively investigating a number of antiviral therapies and treatments to determine their potential in reducing the severity and duration of the symptoms. And you know how I feel because how I feel is on Tuesday, they’re going to be starting it on Tuesday morning, and we’re going to have some medications delivered that we’re going to see if they work."
2020-03-22,19:51,Donald Trump,They certainly are effective in other ways and they are safe from the standpoint is that they’re not killing people. We’re not going to have that. So a lot of great things have been happening in that regard. I just want to finish and then we’re going to ask a couple of people to say a few words that have been so much in the forefront of this incredible job that we’ve all been given.
2020-03-22,20:16,Donald Trump,"But I want to say that I know that this is a challenging time for all Americans. We’re enduring a great national trial and we will prove that we can meet the moment. I want to assure the American people that we’re doing everything we can each day to confront and ultimately defeat this horrible invisible enemy. We’re at war. In a true sense, we’re at war. And we’re fighting an invisible enemy. Think of that."
2020-03-22,20:47,Donald Trump,"For those of you who are feeling alone and isolated, I want you to know that we are all joined together as one people eternally linked by our shared national spirit. We love our country, a spirit of courage and love and patriotism. No American is alone as long as we are united. And we are united, we’re very united. People are saying things now that three weeks ago they didn’t talk that way. We’re very united."
2020-03-22,21:16,Donald Trump,"No force is equal to the strength of really a unified America, united America, an America like we have it right now. For those worried and afraid, please know as long as I am your president, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you. And I will not stop until we win. This will be a great victory. This is going to be a victory. And it’s going to be a victory that in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected."
2020-03-22,21:50,Donald Trump,"It’s now attacking. The enemy is attacking 144 countries at this moment, 144 that’s unthinkable. There’s never been anything like this. And it’s vicious. It is vicious. Some people recover well. And some people have a hard time. We all know that, but we will be totally victorious. We will then get our economy up to a level that it was and in my opinion beyond, because that will be a pent up demand. There is a pent up demand. And a lot of great things will happen. But I’m very proud of our country. I’m very proud. I’m very proud to be your president. And it’s just something that’s just, you’re very special people. So thank you very much. And I’m going to ask if I might, combination of Pete, why don’t you start off. Okay? Please."
2020-03-22,22:48,Pete Gaynor,Thank you Mr president.
2020-03-22,22:49,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-03-22,22:51,Pete Gaynor,"Just a little bit about what we’re doing in Washington, California and New York. We understand that the states of Washington, New York, and California, the areas seeing a steady increase in Corona 19 Virus cases. In order to assist with additional needs identifying those areas, the state of New York was approved for a major disaster and declaration this morning. Washington state was also approved earlier today. California submitted their requests and the president will consider it immediately."
2020-03-22,23:19,Pete Gaynor,"We have medical supplies in route to these states, including respirators, surgical masks, gowns, face shields, coveralls, gloves with quantities already delivered to both Washington, New York and California. And we anticipate additional supplies to be delivered over the next 42 hours to all these states. Under president Trump’s unprecedented national emergency declaration on March 13, FEMA is assisting state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, including reimbursing eligible emergency protective measures taken at the direction or guidance of public health officials in response to this emergency. All 50 States, the District of Columbia, five territories and two tribes are working directly with FEMA under the nationwide emergency."
2020-03-22,24:03,Pete Gaynor,"… and two tribes are working directly with FEMA under the Nationwide Emergency Declaration for COVID-19. With the assistance of the FEMA regional administrators who are throughout the country, we are working to address the needs of state and local officials everywhere."
2020-03-22,24:15,Pete Gaynor,"States, tribal and territorial governments do not need to request separate emergency declarations to receive FEMA assistance under this nationwide declaration. The Emergency Declaration does not authorize direct financial assistance available to individuals such as disaster, unemployment assistance or other needs assistance at this time."
2020-03-22,24:33,Pete Gaynor,"Just a note on the USNS Mercy. Based on analysis of potential needs for hospital beds on the West Coast, the decision was made that the USNS hospital ship Mercy would have the greatest impact in California. The Department of Defense has been given direction to dispatch it to Los Angeles immediately. DOD has advised that the Mercy can get into position within a week or less of today’s order. Even though there are more cases right now in Washington, the projected needs for beds in California is five times more that of Washington. The Mercy will be used to take pressure off local hospitals, other medical needs and not for treating COVID-19 cases."
2020-03-22,25:18,Pete Gaynor,"Finally, a little bit about the National Guard. The federal government continues to take aggressive action and proactive steps to address the COVID-19 threat. As we attack the health and safety or protect the health and safety of American people, it remains our top priority. The National Guard is especially posited and equipped to assist federal, state, local agencies while serving the public."
2020-03-22,25:39,Pete Gaynor,"In response to this unprecedented nationwide operation, President Trump has approved Washington, California, New York National Guard units under Title 30 T, excuse me, Title 32 status for the COVID-19 response. The president’s action provide the nation’s governors continued command of their National Guard forces, enabling states to use additional resources to meet the missions necessary in the COVID-19 response."
2020-03-22,26:06,Pete Gaynor,The National Guard is a viable and responsive avenue to provide a much-needed asset that is state-managed and fairly supported. I want to be clear: This Title 32 activation does not federalize National Guard members. The National Guard is still under the authority of each governor. They will work in concert with the Department of Defense.
2020-03-22,26:26,Pete Gaynor,"We’ve had a lot of disinformation circling and I want to make sure it is understood that this is not martial law. The Department of Defense by way of a mission assignment will lead this task. Then finally, we continue to respond to hundreds of requests from governors across the country in filling all their critical needs. Thank you, sir."
2020-03-22,26:45,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Pete, very much. Good job. Peter Navarro?"
2020-03-22,26:50,Peter Navarro,"Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Good evening. What I want to talk briefly about is the Defense Production Act and to give you the overview here. Using the full power of private enterprise and new full force in the federal government, my job at the White House is to make sure, tactically working with FEMA and HHS, is the American people, particularly our healthcare professionals, get the gloves, the masks, and all of the personal protective equipment they need."
2020-03-22,27:20,Peter Navarro,"I can tell you, sir, that since you signed Defense Production Act, my job’s gotten easier and let me explain why. The Defense Production Act in this context has two primary functions. One is mobilization of the industrial base, in this case the public health industrial base. And the other is allocation of resources both from the supply chain to the manufacturers and from the manufacturers to the end users, such as the healthcare professionals."
2020-03-22,27:54,Peter Navarro,"Now, what we’re seeing on a purely voluntary basis, based on the leadership of this administration, we’re seeing the greatest mobilization in the industrial base since World War II. Every day I’m working with organizations and companies, National Association of Manufacturing, the National Council of Textile Organizations and so on, in terms of building up rapidly our capabilities to get what you need."
2020-03-22,28:21,Peter Navarro,"Now, let’s think about what mobilization means. It can mean, for example, re-purposing a factory. So Pernod Ricard called us last week and they had three hurdles they had to deal with. They called my office, had to make a call to Treasury, FDA and HHS to clear the path. We got that done that day."
2020-03-22,28:44,Peter Navarro,"They started their production that day, moving from alcoholic beverages to hand sanitizers. And as we speak, a truck is moving towards New York and will arrive there Tuesday to share with the hospitals over a thousand gallons of sanitizer. So that would be a re-purpose."
2020-03-22,29:03,Peter Navarro,"A second example would be one that the president offered with Honeywell. Again, Honeywell called the White House asking for help from the president. What they said is, “Look, we want to do this new factory in Smithfield, Rhode Island.” They called me on a Friday morning, and by that night we had a contract in to HHS."
2020-03-22,29:24,Peter Navarro,"HHS flipped that immediately and I had Honeywell moving people and equipment from Massachusetts to that facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island. And we’re going to have those masks produced within 30 days, moving on the assembly chain."
2020-03-22,29:40,Peter Navarro,"So my point is mobilization is re-purposing, building up capabilities. And the other portion is, of course, the allocation of resources. Now, what I can tell you so far is that the Defense Production Act, sir, has given me quite a leverage."
2020-03-22,29:57,Peter Navarro,"When you have a strong leader, you can take a light hand initially. So what we’ve seen with this outpouring of volunteers from private enterprise, we’re getting what we need without putting the heavy hand of government down."
2020-03-22,30:13,Peter Navarro,"There will be, possibly, cases down the road, and the manufacturers have actually asked me and alerted me to this, where some places in the supply chain, they may have problems that the White House will have to break through using the Defense Production Act. We won’t hesitate to do that. The last thing I’ll tell you is that I also get a lot of calls that are very disquieting. Brokers are offering millions of items, whether they’re goggles, masks or whatever. And you go through three different brokers, tracing to a warehouse in LA that’s allegedly got 10 million masks and they want to charge you seven times what they cost. That’s price gouging."
2020-03-22,30:54,Peter Navarro,"A message to the hoarders: If you got any large quantities of material that this country needs right now, get them to market or get them to us. We’ll pay you a fair price. But if you don’t do that, we’re going to come for you and make sure that doesn’t happen in this country. And that would be a good use of the Defense Production Act."
2020-03-22,31:12,Peter Navarro,"So I salute you, sir. You’ve made my job easier and I appreciate that."
2020-03-22,31:16,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Pete, very much. Good job. Mike Pence."
2020-03-22,31:20,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. Task force met this afternoon, as we do every day. Let me begin today by simply saying thank you to the American people. And thank you for the way that people across this country, seven days into 15 days to slow the spread."
2020-03-22,31:38,Mike Pence,"The people in communities large and small across America are responding, are cooperating, are communicating. Not just on behalf of their own health and the health of their family, but more importantly on behalf of the most vulnerable among us. So on behalf of your president and our entire Task Force, just thank you to the American people. I also want to express our appreciation to the governors across the country. President today just announced action in New York, California, and Washington State as the latest demonstration that this administration will do whatever it takes to support the leadership at the state and local level as the American people confront the spread of the coronavirus."
2020-03-22,32:25,Mike Pence,"The legislative efforts that are underway being negotiated on Capitol Hill as we speak, the bi- partisan spirit that’s taking place there that’s reflected in all of our interactions with state leaders around the country is a great credit to the nation. But it should be a great encouragement to the American people that your government at the federal level, at the state level, working with courageous healthcare providers all across America are coming together to meet this moment."
2020-03-22,32:55,Mike Pence,"That is the way our system works. It’s extremely important that the American people recognize that one of the things that makes America different is that we have a system of federalism and that by putting FEMA in the lead, the president has emphasized that our response to the coronavirus is in the anthem of FEMA. It is locally executed, state managed and federally supported."
2020-03-22,33:24,Mike Pence,"We want the people on the ground, the decision makers, to have what they need. We want states to be able to manage the unique circumstances in their states. And whether it be the legislation moving through the Congress or the efforts the president announced today, major disaster declarations, Title 32 on the National Guard, resources flowing, hospital beds flowing, we’re going to continue to make sure that our states have what they need to meet this moment."
2020-03-22,33:50,Mike Pence,"Our task force continues to focus on the priorities the president’s given us. They are testing, mitigation and supplies. And on the subject of testing as is evident to people across the country, testing is more and more available every single day."
2020-03-22,34:04,Mike Pence,"We’ll be detailing tomorrow from this podium the progress that we are making on tests. At this day’s reporting, 254,000 Americans have been tested and received results in coronavirus tests, with slightly more than 30,000 actually testing positive."
2020-03-22,34:25,Mike Pence,"There’s a bit of an encouraging word in that for every American. Remember, everyone that’s being tested now, with the exception of our healthcare workers, are people that have symptoms that make them think they may have the coronavirus."
2020-03-22,34:37,Mike Pence,"As our numbers come in consistently because the 254,000 does not include all the local hospitals or all the local labs in our states, it’s working out to be about one in 10 Americans who’ve been tested who thought they had coronavirus, actually had it. Nine out of 10 did not."
2020-03-22,34:55,Mike Pence,But we’ll continue to roll out the testing to provide that resource to the American people. And we’re working to make testing happen faster. We expect from word from the commercial labs that we should be caught up on the backlog in testing by the middle of the week.
2020-03-22,35:12,Mike Pence,"We are urging today on the president’s behalf that all labs would prioritize in-patient testing. Let me say again, to all of the commercial labs in the country, you will receive guidance from HHS tomorrow."
2020-03-22,35:26,Mike Pence,"But on behalf of the president and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we are urging all commercial labs to prioritize in-patient testing. We want people that’ve been checked into a hospital, that are being treated for what they suspect to be coronavirus to receive those tests more quickly."
2020-03-22,35:47,Mike Pence,"Also, I’m pleased to report that yesterday the FDA approved an emergency authorization on a new test that should be in production by the end of March. It actually would be a coronavirus test, the results of which come back in 45 minutes."
2020-03-22,36:03,Mike Pence,"We’re also working, the FDA is working with manufacturers around the country to come up with even faster, more innovative tests. And as we told our governors in several calls this week, governors and state health officials should simply contact FEMA for the latest information on testing solutions."
2020-03-22,36:20,Mike Pence,"Let me also say tomorrow when we gather at this podium, we’ll be unveiling, with Dr. Bob Redfield in the lead, new guidance for people that work in law enforcement, first responders. People that work in what we call critical infrastructure in the country."
2020-03-22,36:37,Mike Pence,"It was in early March the CDC issued guidance for people that were asymptomatic or did not have symptoms, but who had been exposed to someone with coronavirus. Who gave them guidance about being able to return to work wearing a mask for 14 days."
2020-03-22,36:52,Mike Pence,"Tomorrow at this podium, CDC will unveil, in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security, new guidance which will make it possible for people that have been exposed to return to work more quickly by wearing a mask for a certain period of time."
2020-03-22,37:09,Mike Pence,"Let me also amplify a point on behalf of the president and on behalf of the State Department about Americans abroad. One of the reasons why the United States is in a different position today than portions of Europe are and China and elsewhere, is because the president suspended all travel from China. He suspended travel from Europe and the UK and Ireland."
2020-03-22,37:33,Mike Pence,But the State Department is working around the clock to assist Americans who may find themselves overseas. They’re able to come home. There’s no barrier to Americans coming back to American soil. They’re screened when they come home through a series of airports.
2020-03-22,37:49,Mike Pence,"But we’re aware that with flights being canceled, some Americans have found themselves unable to find a way home. As the president said, we’ve been working very diligently through the State Department to make it possible their commercial flights have been chartered. We’re also working with the military for a backup on flights. At this point, the State Department has brought more than 3,000 Americans back home."
2020-03-22,38:13,Mike Pence,"But speaking to the secretary of state today, he wanted me to share a website and a phone number for any American that might be looking on from overseas. You can call the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program at 1-888-407- 4747. Or you can go online at step.state.gov. This will allow our embassies and consulates to gather important information about your situation and work to facilitate to bring you home."
2020-03-22,38:47,Mike Pence,"Let me say, finally, as I began, let me close. As the chairman or the leader of this White House Coronavirus Task Force, we are seven days into 15 days and the American people are responding. Because as we speak about supplies, as we speak about testing, the most important thing every American can do is heed the guidance and the direction from your state and local officials, particularly in areas where we have widespread coronavirus infections."
2020-03-22,39:15,Mike Pence,"But for every American putting into practice these measures that the president alluded to at the very beginning of his remarks is a way that we can do this, America. We can lessen the magnitude of the coronavirus in our country. With the cooperation, compassion, generosity and prayers of the American people, we can slow the spread, we can protect the most vulnerable and we can heal our land. So let’s do it, America."
2020-03-22,39:46,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike, very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mike."
2020-03-22,39:51,Donald Trump,"So just a couple of little things, then we’ll take some questions. Maybe you will have some, maybe you won’t. That’d be a shock. You’ll shock the American public."
2020-03-22,40:04,Donald Trump,"But I have to say on the testing if this works out and we think it might, the new test will be a very simple one and much easier than the existing test, which is quite complex and not a lot of fun to take. And this will be a game changer."
2020-03-22,40:21,Donald Trump,"But remember we inherited a broken, obsolete system. It was good for a small number of people, but not good for the millions of people that we’re talking about. And we’ve made this into a system that no matter where you go in the world, that’s where they’re going. That’s what they want to do. That’s how they’re going to be doing it, should something like this happen again."
2020-03-22,40:41,Donald Trump,"So our people have done a fantastic job, really a fantastic job and I hope the new test works out. We’ll know fairly soon. I think, doctor, we’re going to be knowing about that fairly soon. Hopefully, it’ll check out or test out and we certainly are looking forward to that. That’ll be a very simple test by comparison. Won’t be unpleasant at all."
2020-03-22,41:04,Donald Trump,"One other thing: the ships. We have the Mercy and it’s going to California, as you know. It’s on the West Coast now. And you have a sister ship; it’s essentially a twin. They’re incredible. I mean, they’re incredible ships."
2020-03-22,41:22,Donald Trump,"I’ve seen it. I’ve seen one of them and they are unbelievable what they can do and the capacity. Many operating rooms. They’re wartime ships. They are meant for war. Many, many operating rooms. Stainless steel, these rooms are as good as there is anywhere in the nation, actually."
2020-03-22,41:43,Donald Trump,"I spoke with Governor Cuomo. We had a great conversation today, a number of conversations, actually. He’s working very hard. And we are going to be bringing that ship that’s called the Comfort. So you have the Mercy and the Comfort. The Comfort’s on the East Coast and that ship will be coming over the next three weeks, three or four weeks. It was in the middle of maintenance and we are moving the maintenance very, very quickly."
2020-03-22,42:09,Donald Trump,"We’re also supplying the ship simultaneously. It’s actually big supplies going into those ships. Big. And that ship will be coming up here over the next few weeks and we’ll probably be putting it in New York Harbor. We’re making arrangements for that also, as to where it’s going to be docked."
2020-03-22,42:28,Donald Trump,"So you have the Mercy and you have the Comfort. They’ll be coming up. The Mercy will start very, very quickly. It’ll be arriving in Los Angeles pretty soon, so we look forward to that."
2020-03-22,42:42,Donald Trump,"A question? ABC, go ahead."
2020-03-22,42:44,Unnamed,"Thank you. First of all, Senator Paul testing positive. When’s the last time you had in-person contact with him?"
2020-03-22,42:51,Donald Trump,"Gee, I think it was quite a while ago. I don’t know. It’s been a long time."
2020-03-22,42:54,Unnamed,"Also on top of Senator Paul now, four senators are in isolation and the rules say that in order to vote, they have to be there."
2020-03-22,43:00,Donald Trump,"Who are they, please? Who are they?"
2020-03-22,43:01,Unnamed,"Romney, Senator Lee Gardner, Senator Rick Scott-"
2020-03-22,43:05,Unnamed,"Senator Gardner, Senator Rick Scott."
2020-03-22,43:06,Unnamed,"Senator Gardner and Senator Rick Scott, also. Two of them were in contact with [crosstalk 00:43:09]-"
2020-03-22,43:07,Donald Trump,I guess Rick is coming out.
2020-03-22,43:10,Unnamed,With the critical stimulus package vote expected soon-
2020-03-22,43:12,Donald Trump,Romney’s in isolation?
2020-03-22,43:13,Unnamed,Yes.
2020-03-22,43:13,Unnamed,Yes.
2020-03-22,43:15,Donald Trump,"Gee, that’s too bad. Go ahead."
2020-03-22,43:18,Unnamed,"Do I detect sarcasm there, sir?"
2020-03-22,43:20,Donald Trump,"No, no. None whatsoever."
2020-03-22,43:21,Unnamed,Do you think that Congress should consider changing the rules to allow them to vote remotely if it comes to this critical stimulus package?
2020-03-22,43:27,Donald Trump,"I was thinking about it today and I’m saying you could have a lot of senators, a lot of House members. I spoke last night with a very, very good man who happens to be in the House, as you know, and he’s just started and he tested positive. So you could have a large number of people in there from Congress. You could have between House and Senate, you could have a large number."
2020-03-22,43:49,Donald Trump,"I think it’s something, at least … I mean, I fully understand why you should be there. I think it may be a constitutional reason why you should. But if we could be in a position where, I would certainly be in favor of it, where they could vote from a certain outside location. I would be in favor of it."
2020-03-22,44:06,Donald Trump,"I was thinking about it today. I mean, we could be in this … Look, with what’s going on, nobody’s ever seen anything like this. You could have a lot of people in there from Congress. And it would certainly be … They tell me there’s a reason constitutionally and there may be, but I would be totally in favor of it on a temporary basis."
2020-03-22,44:27,Unnamed,It does seem like negotiations still have a ways to go on the stimulus package.
2020-03-22,44:30,Donald Trump,Yeah. Yeah.
2020-03-22,44:30,Unnamed,Are you concerned about the timing at all? In the [crosstalk 00:44:32] sense?
2020-03-22,44:32,Donald Trump,"Well, we have an interesting thing. You know, we all want to get to the same place, but we have different … And I just wrote this down just a little while ago. We want to protect the worker very much. So do they, so do the Democrats. We also want to protect the worker through their companies."
2020-03-22,44:49,Donald Trump,"We don’t want to necessarily … We’re going to help the worker anyway. But ideally, they can go back to one of their great companies."
2020-03-22,44:56,Donald Trump,"You have great companies that are in financial trouble now, and we need money to help those companies so they get back into where they should be: health. Most of these companies four weeks ago were having the best year they’ve ever had. Last year was the best year."
2020-03-22,45:11,Donald Trump,"Almost all of them other than Boeing, which is, incredibly, had problems. Big percentage of GDP. But we have to be able to work with Boeing. Boeing was a great company and will be a great company again I think shortly. So we have to work with the companies and they don’t want to do that. It’s crazy. They don’t want to do that."
2020-03-22,45:32,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to stock buybacks, so I don’t know where the problem is there. But I know that’s one of the things that they’re talking about. I do not want stock buybacks. I don’t want to give a bailout to a company and then have somebody go out and use that money to buy back stock in the company and raise the price and then get a bonus. Okay?"
2020-03-22,45:48,Donald Trump,"So I may be Republican, but I don’t like that. I want them to use the money for the workers. I want them to use the money for the company, to help the company. In the airline business, to take care of their planes and all of the things they have to do, including buying new planes."
2020-03-22,46:03,Donald Trump,"But I don’t want to have any stock buybacks. The Democrats are with me. I don’t know what the problem is on that one, because I can’t imagine that is too tough. We want to be able to take care of our people."
2020-03-22,46:19,Donald Trump,"You’re going to have things coming up. We’re going to have some of the elements that they’re talking about. They’re down to, I mean, literally 95% of things that you would think that they wouldn’t agree and you’d think the Republicans wouldn’t agree to it."
2020-03-22,46:33,Donald Trump,"Unemployment, as an example, is one of the things they talk about and unemployment insurance. I think we’re very close on that. But right now they’re not, so right now they’re not there. But I think that the Democrats want to get there and I can tell you for a fact the Republicans want to get there."
2020-03-22,46:50,Donald Trump,"I don’t think anybody actually has a choice. It’s a bold package. It’s a big package. One of the things is we do have money for saving small businesses. I don’t imagine the Democrats, because we have a lot of money set aside for small businesses."
2020-03-22,47:06,Donald Trump,"We also have a lot of money set aside for big businesses. You know the big, powerful companies that were powerful four weeks ago and today they’re overextended."
2020-03-22,47:14,Donald Trump,"Look at the cruise line. That’s a tremendous business, a big business, very important to Florida. And it’s unthinkable a month ago, it just unthinkable. They were setting all sorts of records, they’re building new ships."
2020-03-22,47:28,Donald Trump,"We can’t let the cruise lines go out of business. I mean, that would be massive numbers of jobs for our country and actually for the world. But for our country, it’s a massive business and it doesn’t take much to keep them going. So we have to provide for that."
2020-03-22,47:44,Donald Trump,"But I think both the Democrats and the Republicans are agreed that we have to take care of our workers. And we’re going to be doing that in numerous ways, including a substantial cash payment."
2020-03-22,47:55,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-03-22,47:56,Unnamed,"Newsmax. When it comes to the Defense Production Act, we know that governors across the country all day today, were pleading with you to-"
2020-03-22,48:03,Unnamed,"… Across the country all day today, we’re pleading with you to utilize the DPA saying that they needed specifically-"
2020-03-22,48:06,Donald Trump,"Well, it depends which governors you’re talking about."
2020-03-22,48:07,Unnamed,"… For that allocation piece that you mentioned, Mr. Navarro, why not use it now if that would answer their pleas for help?"
2020-03-22,48:15,Donald Trump,"Well, we are using it now. The fact that I signed it, it’s in effect, but we’re a country not based on nationalizing our business. Call a person over in Venezuela, ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out, not too well. The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept, but I’ll tell you why. As Peter said, we may have to use it someplace along the chain, but we’re getting calls. Here’s the beauty of it. If we go out and we want, let’s say masks, we don’t know who to call on mask, but Hanes who makes things of cotton, various elements, lots of things. It’s a great company. They called us and they said, we’re going to make millions of masks. We got a call today from 3M, there’s a big article today. The head of 3M. They are going to make tremendous products and they’re more or less in that business."
2020-03-22,49:05,Donald Trump,"And if they’re not, like for instance, General Motors spoke to us, Ford spoke to us about doing ventilators. The beauty is they’re calling us. If you go the national route, nationalization route, we’re going to tell a company to make a ventilator. They don’t even know what a ventilator is. In the case of one company, they used to make them years ago and they know how to make them. It’s a very complex piece of equipment, frankly. So what we’re doing is, I think Peter said it may be better than anybody’s going to say it. We have the threat of doing it if we need it, we may have to use it somewhere along the supply chain in a minor way, but we have millions of masks being done. We have respirators, we have ventilators. We have a lot of things happening right now."
2020-03-22,49:48,Donald Trump,"So just the threat of using it, but using it’s actually a big deal. I mean, when this was announced, it sent tremors through our business community and through our country, because basically what are you doing? You’re talking about you’re going to nationalize an industry or you’re going to nationalize, you’re going to take away companies, you’re going to tell companies what to do. The truth is most people, nobody would know where to start. There are companies out there that you wouldn’t think of that have called us that say, “We can do ventilators. We used to do them years ago.” And they can do them in large quantities. If I call companies and say, “You build ventilators,” they don’t even know what a ventilator is."
2020-03-22,50:27,Donald Trump,"So it’s really working out very well. One of the reasons I read the numbers to you is because we’ve given vast numbers of just about everything. We’ve taken it out of our supply, and we’re restocking our supply. But we’re really backing up the governors. The governors have to go out and do their things and you have a lot of governors, they’ve done a fantastic job. You have some that haven’t. Usually, it’s the ones that complain that have the problems. But we’ve had a great relationship as an example with Governor Cuomo, with Governor Newsome. We’ve had a great relationship with the state of Washington. Those are three hotbeds. Those are three hotbeds. Now, we’re also dealing with other states. As the Admiral said yesterday, we’re dealing with all of the states actually in one form or another. Some are very affected in a very minor way where you have two people or three people, and I don’t even mean deaths. I mean literally cases. And that’s different than New York, where you have tremendous where everybody, I lived there for a long time. Everybody’s extremely close, tight, and you have a lot of cases in New York. You have a lot of cases in New York, and we’re helping Governor Cuomo, we’re helping Governor Newsome. Frankly, they’ve been total gentlemen. They want to get it done and we want to get it done. But doing it the way we’re doing it is much better. It’s really much better."
2020-03-22,51:47,Unnamed,"But in terms of I’m asking about the supply chain, it’s about allocation, not about manufacturing. So the companies, it’s not about nationalizing the companies, it’s about the allocation."
2020-03-22,51:55,Donald Trump,"But it all comes from… Yeah, I know. You’re right. We coordinate with the states and we are coordinating with the states, and for the most part the coordination has been very good. Look, three days ago I had a phone call with all the governors. I actually allowed the press to stay. They weren’t supposed to stay. And one person in the media said “That was surprising. It’s actually a little risky doing that.” Because we had Democrats and we had Republicans, and they’re politicians, and they always have something to say. Well, I took a lot of calls, and we really didn’t get one nasty or bad response. They were thanking us for the job we did."
2020-03-22,52:31,Donald Trump,"And I had the press standing, I don’t know if you were there. I don’t think so. I had the press standing there watching. They weren’t supposed to be there, but I said “Let them stand there.” The governors were very complimentary, very, very complimentary. And I watched over the last few days, Governor Cuomo, I watched Gavin Newsome in California, I watched both of them. And they’ve been very complimentary. And those are really the hotbeds, and so we want to keep that going. I’m very proud of this country and I’m frankly very proud of a lot of the politicians that normally we’re fighting with. We have different views on things, a little different view, but we’re going to get to the same place. We have different views, but we’re going to get to the same place. Yes, please."
2020-03-22,53:13,Unnamed,Yes. I wanted to ask if you’re considering an executive order to free elderly nonviolent criminals from federal prisons?
2020-03-22,53:20,Donald Trump,"We have been asked about that and we’re going to take a look at it. It’s a bit of a problem, but when we talk about totally nonviolent, we’re talking about totally nonviolent prisoners. We are actually looking at that. Yes. Go ahead real quick."
2020-03-22,53:39,Unnamed,"Also, your administration eliminated a key position in China in July, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency. And it was just months before the first cases were spotted in Wuhan. So the question is basically why the post was eliminated and-"
2020-03-22,53:56,Donald Trump,"Well, I could ask… Anybody? Would you like to take that one, Bob? But this is just like all of the other stuff that you, not you, but that the press was asking, all of which turned out to be, we actually gave CDC more money, not less money. They said we defunded, it turned out it was more money. Every one of those things that were said were 100% wrong. And this sounds like another one of them. But anyway, go ahead."
2020-03-22,54:20,Bob,"Yeah. As you know, CDC has offices all around the world right now to do our function to detect and prevent and respond to outbreaks where they occur. The China office is actually being augmented as we speak, and we’ve been embedded there for over 30 years. There’s a reason they call it the Chinese CDC, because we’ve had that productive partnership."
2020-03-22,54:46,Donald Trump,"And I wish, again, our relationship with China is a very good relationship. I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem. We didn’t know about it. They knew about it, and they should have told us. We could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world. If you look at what’s happening in Italy, in Spain, and a lot of other countries, we could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world. Kelly?"
2020-03-22,55:07,Kelly,"Mr. President, given the diagnosis for Senator Paul and people being a self quarantine, what concerns do you have about the direct threat to the function of the Senate, the ability to get this important package that people are waiting for passed, and should Americans be expecting you to extend the 15 days given the climate of how this is spreading at this point?"
2020-03-22,55:31,Donald Trump,"Well, I hope we won’t have to. It’s possible, but we’ll have to see how that works. As far as the Senate is concerned, we are looking at some of the folks who are feeling very good, some are quarantine, but they’re negative. They may be totally fine. Others are positive. We’re just finding this now for the first time. I mean over the last two days we found that."
2020-03-22,55:58,Kelly,Do you see it as a threat to the aid package that Americans are waiting for?
2020-03-22,56:02,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t see any threats at all. Honestly, I don’t see any threats at all. It’ll all work out. It is a question and a very good question, I thought, that we are considering. Now, I don’t know if you can do it constitutionally, but we are considering letting people vote senators, congressmen and women, vote from a separate location. From an outside, namely a hospital or a home, depending on where they are. So we are looking at that. It’s a little trickier question most people would believe, but we are looking at that very strongly."
2020-03-22,56:34,Unnamed,"Speaking of the same thing, I think Kelly was kind of alluding to it, while we’ve been up here. They weren’t able to get the 60 votes to move the package for the cloture vote. I’m just curious, just your reaction to that sir, and then what is Mitch McConnell telling you and Secretary Mnuchin-"
2020-03-22,56:47,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re dealing with them all the time. And we’re dealing with Mitch. We’re dealing with the other side. Everybody wants to get there. We’ll see what happens. I think you’ll get there. To me, it’s not very complicated. We have to help the worker. We have to save the companies. Because as soon as we’re finished with this war, it’s not a battle. It’s a war. As soon as we’re finished with this war, our country is going to bounce back like you’ve never seen before."
2020-03-22,57:13,Donald Trump,"But, we have to get into that position, and we have to make sure that those companies are whole, that they haven’t been disbanded. Because if you do that, it’s going to take much longer. So in a way it’s being penny wise if you don’t, but we want to help the worker. We want to help the companies that the workers come from, because if those companies go out of business, and that includes small businesses. We have a tremendous amount of small business work in there. You know that. Once they go out and they don’t come back, that’s a much longer period of building."
2020-03-22,57:43,Unnamed,"Sir, I apologize. There was a woman that was an American that was… Was she being tortured? What was going on there?"
2020-03-22,57:49,Donald Trump,"Bad things were happening to her in a certain country, and we’re really under the feeling that we should keep it somewhat private until she’s already been freed, and I have to tell you General Milley and his people were unbelievable. They were not playing games. General Milley does not play games. He’s a very interesting guy. They got her out. They got her out of a certain situation where she was seriously abused, accosted. And whatever the maximum word is other than death. That happened. But we got her out and she’s okay and she’s back with her parents."
2020-03-22,58:29,Unnamed,"Can I ask you one more question, sir?"
2020-03-22,58:30,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-22,58:31,Unnamed,"It’s something I’ve just been curious about. Previous crises, like the tsunami, Katrina, past presidents, they’ve called their predecessors and said, “Hey, I need you to step in,” do something like that. Do you have any interest in reaching out to presidents Bush, Obama, Clinton, Carter, or talking to them? I’m just curious if that’s something you consider enough."
2020-03-22,58:46,Donald Trump,"Look, I have the best people in the world. I think we’re doing an extraordinary job. If you look in, let’s say the H1N1, you look at that whole, that was a disaster. That was a tough period of time for our country. You look at so many other things that weren’t handled very well, whether it’s Katrina or something else. Look, I respect everybody, but I feel I have an incredible team and I think we’re doing an incredible job. When you look at the job we’re doing, and all you have to do is look at the approval numbers on the job we’re doing. I think we’re doing an incredible job, so I don’t want to disturb them, bother them. I don’t think I’m going to learn much, and I guess you could say that there’s probably a natural inclination not to call. Now, if I felt that if I called, I’d learn something, and that would save one life, it would save one life. Okay. I would make the call in two minutes, but I don’t see that happening. Please."
2020-03-22,59:43,Unnamed,"Can I ask you about the comments that a couple of your four aides have said today? Gary Cohn said, “Is it time to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on?” Where Steve Bannon is saying, “Drop the hammer today on the virus, we’re going to have to take the pain out front. We have to shut it all down.” I want to ask what the tension between, the economic pain we’re suffering, and of course the virus itself and the casualty and deaths from there?"
2020-03-22,01:00:09,Donald Trump,"I’m of the opinion we have to do great during these 14 days, during the 15 day period. We’ll know at the end of 14 days pretty much we’re going to have a pretty good idea how we’re doing. I think you have to shut it down and you have to see, but there’ll be a point at which we say “We’re back in business. Let’s go.”"
2020-03-22,01:00:24,Unnamed,Is that point coming sooner or-
2020-03-22,01:00:25,Donald Trump,"Those two statements are not mutually exclusive, if you understand. I saw both of them today and they sort of intermesh."
2020-03-22,01:00:31,Unnamed,… For more of a shutdown than we are now?
2020-03-22,01:00:33,Donald Trump,"He’s calling for a faster, just a brutal shutdown, and then open up maybe a little bit faster. So there’s that fine line. Look, we did a big shutdown when we wouldn’t allow people from China that could have been very seriously infected that were when we cut that off very early, and then we cut Europe off very early as you know. So that was also very [inaudible 01:00:54]."
2020-03-22,01:00:55,Unnamed,When do you start opening main street back up?
2020-03-22,01:00:55,Donald Trump,"Well, I can’t tell you that. What I have to say is that I think we’re going to have good results. I think the American people have been amazing. I think our stimulus package will get done and it will be a tremendous package. They may not have gotten those votes, but they’re very close to getting a deal done. So I’d be surprised if they didn’t. And if they don’t, I think frankly the American people will be very upset with the Democrats because the Republicans are ready to approve a deal. So the only reason the deal couldn’t get done is pure politics. Yes, please."
2020-03-22,01:01:30,Unnamed,"Mr. President, despite your differences with New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, he says that the city is going to run out of basic hospital supplies by April. How you prevent New York City from becoming the next Italy?"
2020-03-22,01:01:42,Donald Trump,"Well, he should have the hospital systems in various places. Some have been stocked and ready to go for… Nothing for this. Nothing. This is beyond anything that anybody ever thought possible. I think you could really say this. Nobody can really, Dr. Nobody can really say, “Oh gee, this will happen.” This is a very unique and hopefully it will be unique for many, many centuries for a long time. Hopefully we don’t see this again. But again, the systems are supposed to be ready, willing, and able. This is supposed to be ready to go. We are helping them a lot, and I have great love for New York City and I have great love for New York state. And we’re going to help them a lot."
2020-03-22,01:02:27,Donald Trump,"I mean, I was just saying we’re sending our ships up there. We’re sending more than just this ship. We may be using, if we need, we’ll be using some of the cruise ships that you’ve been reading about. We’ll be using them also because they’re very immediate and very quick. They can be there very quickly. We have good docking systems in the places that we’re talking about. So we may be using some of the cruise liners that we’re talking about. But no. I mean I think Bill de Blasio is working very hard. I think he’s trying very hard. It’s a tough situation for him and every mayor because nobody’s ever seen the scale. When you hear you’ve given millions of masks and you’ve given hundreds of thousands of masks in a certain short period of time, and then you hear they need many, many more."
2020-03-22,01:03:12,Donald Trump,"One of the things they have started with respect to masks is the sterilization process. Some, it works very well. Others aren’t really set up that way. You throw them out. But we have a sterilization process that’s working very hard. Speaking of that, hand sanitizers, when you asked the question on the companies and what’s going on, we have many companies now, companies that made whiskey, they’d made alcohol, they’ve now gone very quickly into the hand sanitizers. And all of you know, you’ve been reading about three or four big companies, we’re doing incredibly well on that."
2020-03-22,01:03:48,Donald Trump,"There was no way if you took the existing companies that something like that could happen. But it happens almost… They’ll call Peter Navarro, or they’ll call somebody. On one case they called me, they said, “We can do this, we can do that.” We’ve had a lot of those calls where companies want to… There’s a company in New Hampshire, a great company, they want to make ventilators. I’d never thought of them for ventilators, but they do make metal equipment and things that have metal. There’ll be great. They’ll make a great product. So Peter, I think you’re seeing a lot of that."
2020-03-22,01:04:16,Peter Navarro,"Yes, sir."
2020-03-22,01:04:16,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-22,01:04:16,Unnamed,The bill that is being contemplated by the Senate right now has a fund that has hundreds of billions of dollars for the treasury department to use to bail out states and localities as well as specific industries such as cruises and hotels. Will you commit publicly that none of that taxpayer money will go towards your own personal property?
2020-03-22,01:04:36,Donald Trump,"Well every time I do it, like for instance, I committed publicly that I wouldn’t take the $450,000 salary. It’s a lot of money. Whether you’re rich or not, it’s a lot of money and I did it. Nobody cared. Nobody said “Thank you.” Nobody said “Thank you very much.” Now, I didn’t commit legal. I just said, I don’t want it. I don’t want my salary. I work for zero. I don’t want my salary. Nobody said, “Oh, thank you very much,” but I guarantee you if I ever took it, you would go out after me. You in particular, would go out after me like crazy. So I have no idea what they’re talking about with regard to the one element. Everything’s changing, just so you understand. It’s all changing. But I have no idea."
2020-03-22,01:05:15,Donald Trump,"But every time I commit to do something, I committed to do… Look, I ran and everybody knew I was a rich person. I built a great company and people knew that, but I agreed to do things I didn’t have to, I still don’t have to. But my company, I told the kids who are running it, I’m not running it. But I told them, “Don’t deal with foreign companies. Don’t deal.” I didn’t have to do that. I could’ve just ran and I didn’t have to do that at all. And instead of being thanked for, again not agreeing to do it, but just for not doing it, I get excoriated all the time. So I’ve learned, let’s just see what happens because we have to save some of these great companies that can be great companies literally in a matter of weeks. We have to save them. Yeah, please."
2020-03-22,01:06:06,Unnamed,"Mr. President, can I go back to your announcement at the top about the National Guard and then also the medical structures that are going to be built?"
2020-03-22,01:06:14,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-03-22,01:06:14,Unnamed,"Okay, so you had said that there would be eight large medical structures that will be built in California with more than 2000 beds, and then I think I heard you say there would be four small medical structures in the state of Washington with 250 beds."
2020-03-22,01:06:27,Donald Trump,"Pete, go ahead."
2020-03-22,01:06:27,Unnamed,And could you say what cities and areas those are going to be in specifically?
2020-03-22,01:06:34,Peter Navarro,"So we are filling the governor’s request, and so we send that resource to them. They will put it to best use, they’ll put it to where they will have the most effect. So we don’t dictate exactly where it goes. Again, it’s a request from the state to the federal government for a certain asset, and those assets are sent the governor can use it as he or she sees fit."
2020-03-22,01:06:53,Unnamed,"And you’re still considering, you just said that using the cruise ships as well. So-"
2020-03-22,01:06:59,Donald Trump,"If we need them. I hope we don’t need them. I hope you’re going to have great luck on Tuesday morning. We sent a lot of the medicine, we don’t have to go into it again, but we sent a lot of the medicine to Governor Cuomo. I believe they already have it, and they have some very capable people. We spoke to Dr. Zucker who is his primary representative on this, and we spoke to the governor himself, and I think he’s excited about it like I’m excited about it. Now, will it work? I think it has a really good chance. I think it’s worthwhile. Why should we be testing it in a test tube for a year and a half when we have thousands of people that are very sick? They’re very, very sick. And we can use it on those people, and maybe make them better, and in some cases maybe saved their lives."
2020-03-22,01:07:50,Donald Trump,"So Governor Cuomo told me they’ll be using their supply, starting their supply on Tuesday morning. I think it’s very exciting, I think because if that happens, much of what we’re talking about with ships and hospitals and all of the things that we’re doing, and all of these masks and everything that we’re ordering, ventilators, it’s a whole different game if that happens. And we’ll see. There’s been some tremendous signs that this could work. Now again, some doctors think it should go for years on testing, but this has been something that’s been around for many years. It’s been phenomenal, strong, powerful drug for malaria."
2020-03-22,01:08:31,Donald Trump,"But we think it might work on this based on evidence, based on very strong evidence. We’re going to see, we’re going to know sometime after Tuesday. But you’ll have to ask Governor Cuomo, I think they’re going to start the process. We’ve gotten them the drug. I think they’re going to start the process of giving the drug through mouth. And I think that starts on Tuesday morning, he said. And that’ll be, I mean, I’ll tell you what. I don’t want to get anybody overly excited, but I’m very excited by that, by the prospect of it. Then in addition to that, NIH is working on vaccines and all. They’re making great progress, but the vaccine does have to be tested for a long period of time because you can’t give thousands millions of people a vaccine and it turns out to be dangerous. So that does have to be tested. But this one’s been taken for a long time, so we know pretty much one result. Yeah, please."
2020-03-22,01:09:27,Unnamed,Thank you. Mr president. I wanted to ask about China and president Xi. When was the last time you had a conversation with him?
2020-03-22,01:09:34,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t want to exactly say that. But I have spoken to president Xi about this, specifically about this. And look, he doesn’t want this, this is not something that he wants. And it happened, it happened to China. And one thing they told me, I was told by our great Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, that China’s been buying a lot of our farm product. And I’m looking at different pricing, but China has, despite all of this. And it started, this delayed it a little bit obviously, but it started fairly recently. But China is buying… We made a new deal as you know, with China, very big trade deal. And China has been buying our agricultural product."
2020-03-22,01:10:15,Unnamed,"Have you talked to China about masks? I mean, they’ve been a supplier of the United States of masks, of a lot of its equipment. Have you tried to open those back up?"
2020-03-22,01:10:20,Donald Trump,"Yes. In fact, they are sending masks to Italy. We’re in a very good process with masks, but I’m a little upset with China, I’ll be honest with you. Because as much as I like president Xi and as much as I respect the country and and admire the country, I have great admiration for the country, what they’ve done in short period of time. Of course our presidents, our previous presidents allowed that to happen. You should say thank you very much to all of them, but they should have told us about this. And I did ask him whether or not we could send some people in, they didn’t want that, out of pride. I think really out of pride."
2020-03-22,01:11:02,Donald Trump,"They don’t want us sending people into China to help them. China’s strong country. They have their scientists and they have their doctors. Very smart. A lot of people, but I did discuss that about sending our people in and they didn’t really respond. We went again, they didn’t respond. If they went in, they would have been able to tell us, give us a much earlier indication, but we had an early indication. That’s why I closed out China. I mean, I felt it was my instinct, but that’s why I closed out China at a very early time. Please."
2020-03-22,01:11:39,Unnamed,"Mr. President, are undocumented persons welcome at testing sites and can they show up and be tested without fear of being reported to immigration officials for possible deportation?"
2020-03-22,01:11:50,Donald Trump,"It’s really a fair question. I think I’ll let… Would you like to answer that question? Please, please. Surgeon General."
2020-03-22,01:11:58,Jerome Adams,"We know from a public health perspective that it is important that people who have symptoms can get tested, but as you heard…"
2020-03-22,01:12:03,Jerome Adams,"Feel that it is important that people who have symptoms can get tested, but as you heard earlier, we are-"
2020-03-22,01:12:05,Unnamed,Regardless of citizenship.
2020-03-22,01:12:06,Jerome Adams,"Well, we know that the virus doesn’t judge based on where you’re from, and so it’s important that we try to get people tested who have symptoms, but the important thing that we really want people to hear is that in-patients need to be tested. We need to prioritize our healthcare workers. And one thing I would like to say to you all very quickly, on behalf of the doctors on the task force, healthcare workers, we hear you. We hear you and we absolutely are prioritizing your health and safety, making sure healthcare workers can get tested, in-patients can get tested, people at highest risk. But to answer your question, yes, we absolutely want to make sure people who have symptoms, who could be spreading it, can get tested. [crosstalk 01:12:45]"
2020-03-22,01:12:46,Unnamed,"Sorry, question, Surgeon General."
2020-03-22,01:12:51,Mike Pence,"Department of Homeland Security addressed that issue a few days ago. Customs and Border Protection actually issued guidance that absent certain circumstances, Customs and Border Protection does not target emergency rooms or health clinics, and I would refer you to the website. They issued a very clear statement making it clear to any person that is in need of a test or medical care that Customs and Border Protection is not focusing on emergency rooms or health clinics or the drive-through clinics."
2020-03-22,01:13:30,Unnamed,So that they could come in without fear of-
2020-03-22,01:13:33,Donald Trump,"Yes. I’ll answer that, and if that’s not the policy, I’ll make it the policy. And I was just saying as Mike was saying that the answer is, yes, we will do those tests, because I think in that case it’s important. I think that if you could say illegal alien, you could say illegal immigrant, you could say whatever you want to use your definition of what you’re talking about, we’re all talking about the same thing, yes, we will test that person. Because I think it’s important that we test that person and we don’t want to send that person back into wherever we’re going to be sending the person, whether it’s another country or someplace else because we’re now bringing them right out of our country. But yeah, we will test those people. Okay?"
2020-03-22,01:14:18,Unnamed,"[inaudible 01:14:18] Sorry, Mr. Surgeon General. Question for you. We were talking about this before the briefing. A lot of folks, they’re watching TV, they’re reading up on this constantly. If you are not somebody who’s got a preexisting health condition, but all of a sudden you go, “All of a sudden, I just don’t feel 100%,” and then your mind just starts playing with you, right? You think, “Oh my god, I coughed three hours ago. Was that a first sign?” When should those people really start to say, “Okay, maybe I need to call the doctor.” Because you don’t want to flood them, but a lot of people that are probably healthy right now are thinking, “Whoa, wait. That’s all I’m hearing about. It’s all I can think about. When should I either call a doctor or get tested?”"
2020-03-22,01:14:52,Donald Trump,Do you need a test?
2020-03-22,01:14:55,Unnamed,"Well, I hope not."
2020-03-22,01:14:55,Jerome Adams,"I asked him before you came in, if they’ve had their temperature checked."
2020-03-22,01:14:58,Donald Trump,He better not. He better not.
2020-03-22,01:14:59,Jerome Adams,"The Vice President gave an important statistic this morning. Only 10% of the people who have symptoms who have been tested actually tested positive for coronavirus, meaning nine out of 10 people who actually likely had symptoms do not have the coronavirus. So I want people to understand that so that they are reassured."
2020-03-22,01:15:18,Jerome Adams,"I also want to direct people to a website we’ve been telling them about all the time, coronavirus.gov. Coronavirus.gov has information to walk you through the symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, body aches, and what to do if you have symptoms or you’re worried. The most important thing we can tell people is call your healthcare provider, talk to your healthcare provider information that coronavirus.gov to walk you through when to come in and when and what to do."
2020-03-22,01:15:46,Unnamed,"And Mr. Vice President, you got tested yesterday, I’m just curious, sir, can you tell us what that was like for you? A lot of people are going to be going through this. Were you standing by the phone? Were you just having an iced tea? What was that like and what did you do to kind of kill that time to keep your mind at ease?"
2020-03-22,01:16:00,Donald Trump,He wasn’t happy.
2020-03-22,01:16:02,Mike Pence,"The test was very quick, but it goes a fair amount up into your sinuses and it’s not comfortable, and that’s the reason it probably is a good opportunity to say again to any American looking on, if you don’t have symptoms, you don’t need a test. And the current testing format, although they’re evolving regularly now, we just mentioned that I think at the end of this week there’ll be a new test and there’s all new technologies. I would say again to all the governors that are looking on and their state health officials, contact FEMA, we’ll give you all the latest information on new testing that is available, including steps we’re making where Americans would be able to test themselves and send it in."
2020-03-22,01:16:49,Unnamed,"What was that like for you, sir?"
2020-03-22,01:16:50,Mike Pence,"Well, for me and Mrs. Pence, it was kind of a pinch. It was kind of invasive, but we were grateful for the support. Walter Reed Hospital processed the test very quickly. They had a lab at the hospital to be able to do that and gave us the results quickly. But it also informed me we. We were wondering during that time as a family, and it’s one of the reasons the President’s made it such a priority that we brought all these commercial labs together, and now more than a quarter million tests have been done. We believe we’ll be caught up, if you will, by the middle of this week on a backlog of tests."
2020-03-22,01:17:29,Mike Pence,"But we announced today that we are directing commercial labs to prioritize people who are in the hospital for tests, because we want to continue to work with new technology and with the new focus and guides from HHS to get the results of that as quickly as possible for every American. So if they have coronavirus, they can be properly treated, or they can have the peace of mind that they may have some other respiratory ailment, but not that."
2020-03-22,01:18:00,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President."
2020-03-22,01:18:02,Donald Trump,"[inaudible 01:18:02] You know, everybody that knows Karen Pence, knows this, because the Vice President told me. He said, “She actually handled it better than him.” Right?"
2020-03-22,01:18:12,Mike Pence,That’s true.
2020-03-22,01:18:12,Donald Trump,"That’s true, right? I didn’t handle so well either, don’t worry about it."
2020-03-22,01:18:16,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Speaker Pelosi, earlier today said that the House may introduce its own bill. A, are you willing to work with the Speaker on a House bill, and given what happened in the Senate just a short time ago, what are you willing to do to get this bill over the finish line given the urgency? Secondly, did you send a letter to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un seeking cooperation [crosstalk 01:18:43] with the coronavirus and if so, what type of-"
2020-03-22,01:18:45,Donald Trump,"Sure, with numerous countries. If they need help, we’ll give them help. There’s nobody has what we have, especially with the new tests that are coming out. North Korea, Iran by the way, and others, we are open for helping other countries and is a very serious time, and North Korea’s going through something. Iran is going through something very, very strong. Iran is really going through it, very difficult period with respect to this as you know. It’s really a glad hand. It’s all it is to North Korea, to Iran, and to many other countries, and we’re working with as the doctor can say, we’re working with many countries with respect to the problems that they have."
2020-03-22,01:19:25,Donald Trump,"Again, it’s over 140 countries right now, but North Korea, Iran, and many other countries, we will help and we’re willing to, as an example, this new test. If this new test works at where instead of going through what we all went through with this rather difficult test, to put it nicely, is that just a swab on the tongue, doctor? How does that work?"
2020-03-22,01:19:51,Unnamed,"It’s a similar swab, but I think we’re going to do it in the nose."
2020-03-22,01:19:57,Donald Trump,"Not to the same [crosstalk 01:19:57]. It doesn’t go all the way up and hangs a right under your eye. Right? It’s a tough test. So if we do that, the procedure, the test, and nobody has this in the world, nobody has this. This is developed by us. We think it’s going to be certified soon. We think it’s going to be very good. But if we have that, we’ll be able to help a lot of countries."
2020-03-22,01:20:18,Unnamed,"What about Speaker Pelosi, sir? What about Speaker Pelosi, sir?"
2020-03-22,01:20:20,Donald Trump,We’re going to work with everybody and see if we can get something done. Please.
2020-03-22,01:20:24,Unnamed,"Just to follow up on that, are you willing to work directly with Speaker Pelosi if she writes the House bill?"
2020-03-22,01:20:28,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we’ll work with whoever we have to. We have to help the American worker. We have to help the countries from which the American workers, I mean, they came out of these companies. They were doing phenomenally well. You saw where payroll was going way up, where wages were going way, way up. There’s never been a time like this. We can’t lose those companies and we want the worker to be happy, and we’re being, I think, more generous than anybody’s ever been. We want to take care of the worker, but we want to make sure that when we win the war, it’s only a question of it’s when, not if, when we win the war against the virus, we want to make sure those companies that are ready to charge forward, not that they’d been disbanded because we were penny wise and dollar foolish."
2020-03-22,01:21:10,Unnamed,"Mr. President, there are factors around the world that produce medical protective equipment that are used in European hospitals. They’ve been certified for use and at the highest level in European hospitals. Is the FDA and your administration willing to look at a waiver for that equipment to be sold from those factories?"
2020-03-22,01:21:25,Donald Trump,"Well, we were asked that question a little while ago, and the answer is we may, but we may not need it. We do a very high standard. Our standard is higher. Please."
2020-03-22,01:21:32,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I was hoping you could give some guidance to American families who are anxious about their financial futures. Earlier today, on one of the Sunday morning shows, the Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, was talking about the millions of Americans who are impacted by these shutdowns that are happening in cities and sometimes full states, and secretary Mnuchin said that this shutdown, this lockdown, could last 10 to 12 weeks, perhaps early into June. Given that, would you consider another fiscal stimulus, another check to these families?"
2020-03-22,01:22:04,Donald Trump,"We’re going to see what happens. Hopefully we won’t need it, but we might, but we’re going to see what happens. Look, the greatest thing we can do is win the war. The war is against the virus. That’s the war. We do that, everything, I really believe everything’s going to fall into place. It’s going to be beautiful. I call it a pent up demand. People are dying to go out to a restaurant. People are dying to go onto airplanes. I think there’s a tremendous pent up demand. You may be surprised to the degree. I think it’s going to go very rapidly because this wasn’t a financial crisis, just the opposite, this was a medical crisis."
2020-03-22,01:22:44,Unnamed,"Did you sell stocks, Mr. President? Did you or your family sell stocks?"
2020-03-22,01:22:44,Donald Trump,No. I don’t have stock. I own things.
2020-03-22,01:22:45,Unnamed,Did you make any alternatives to investments in advance of this?
2020-03-22,01:22:49,Donald Trump,"I didn’t even think about it. You know, it’s very interesting that you ask a question like that, nasty question and yet it deserves to be asked, I guess. What I’ve done by deciding to run, and I knew this, I knew this the first day. I said, “If I win, it’s going to cost a lot of money.” It cost me billions of dollars to become President, to be President of the United States. In things that would normally be run at a certain thing. Even people that don’t like me because they think I’m too tough on the border. Now some people love me for it. Other people don’t like me at all. You know, it’s very funny. My wife, we were at a charity event in New York City. I had just announced that I was running, and we were at the Robin Hood Foundation at the Convention Center, which now we’re going to be converting to hospitals for Governor Cuomo, and I was walking in and there was a smattering of booze and a smattering of cheers."
2020-03-22,01:23:49,Donald Trump,"I was getting both. And our very popular first lady, she’s turned out to be very popular, people have great respect for, but our very popular first lady said to me, “Huh, that’s strange. I’ve never heard anybody booing you.” That was very early on, because I think I called for strong borders, or I called for something that other people don’t like, and I knew this would happen. I knew it was going to happen, but the fact that I ran, and I knew as soon as they announced, when I ran, I said, “It’s going to cost me a fortune, not only in terms of actual costs. Look at my legal costs. You people, everybody, everybody is suing me. I’m being sued by people that I never even heard of. I’m being sued all over the place and doing very well, but it’s unfair. But I’ll say this. In terms of running for President and I don’t think rich people, Michael Bloomberg spent now it’s determined almost a billion dollars and look what happened."
2020-03-22,01:24:53,Donald Trump,"I think it’s very hard for rich people to run for office. It’s far more costly. It’s a very tough thing. Now, with all of that being said, I’m so glad I’ve done it because you know, there are a lot of rich people around, got a lot of rich friends, but they can’t help, and they can’t do what I’ve done in terms of helping this country. We are doing things. We got sidetracked by the invisible enemy. But you know what? When you look at what we’ve done, I said before with the veterans, with all of the things we’ve done, especially choice, but when you look at all of accountability, when you look at all of the things that we’ve done, rebuilding the military, the tax cuts, which thank goodness we had the tax cuts because we had cushion."
2020-03-22,01:25:40,Donald Trump,"Oh, and without that, this would have been catastrophic. We had a big cushion. I mean with all of the losses that you’ve seen in the stock market, we’re basically back, and with this horrible thing. If this would’ve happened before, you would have had nothing left. This was all cushion. But I will say that it costs me billions of dollars to be President. And especially with all the money I could have made for the last three, four years, and I didn’t because I was being President. I have no interest in it. I’m allowed to. I don’t know if you know. George Washington, they say he was a rich man supposedly, relatively rich, and he ran the presidency and he also ran his business. They say he had two desks. Nobody complained until I came along. I got elected as a rich person, but nobody complained until I came along."
2020-03-22,01:26:31,Donald Trump,"So it cost me billions of dollars to be President, and I am so happy I did it because who cares? Who cares? I’m really happy with the job we’re doing, and I’m glad that this team and me are here for this horrible thing. I mean, a number of people have said it, and I feel it actually. I’m a wartime President. This is a war. This is a war, different kind of a war that we’ve ever had. And when you look at the economics of the war, in the past, we used to stimulate to get people jobs. Now we’re stimulating to protect people because we don’t want them to work because we want them to stay away from each other. We don’t want them to gather social, social gathering. So we’re paying billions of dollars, more than that, so that they don’t gather, because we have to defeat this virus and we will. But it cost me billions and billions of dollars to be President, and I am so happy I did it."
2020-03-22,01:27:29,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:15:31]. Mr. President, can I ask about foreign countries, please? I realize that your priority is to Americans and of course this nation, but have you ever considered supporting the foreign countries who are also fighting this global pandemic? Let me [crosstalk 00:15:46]."
2020-03-22,01:27:45,Donald Trump,"Well, we do help foreign countries. That was the other question and I’m honored to help and the doctor has helped. The Surgeon General is speaking to other countries all the time. They’re asking him questions, what do we do? Nobody’s ever seen anything like this. They’re calling our people all of the time and yes, I have let it be known that we’ll help people, including North Korea, including Iran, and including many other countries. It’s very important to do this."
2020-03-22,01:28:08,Unnamed,"Are you considering any financial support for them? Let me quote to you. Two retired, a retired General and a retired Admiral from the U.S. Global Coalition, “No matter how successful we are in fighting the threat of COVID-19 pandemic at home, we’ll never stop it unless we’re also finding it around the world.” So financially, is there anything in the stimulus bill? And then are you considering any financials?"
2020-03-22,01:28:29,Donald Trump,"So no, not in the stimulus bill, but we are very much, I mean, we give away billions of dollars for, as an example, AIDS in Africa. We’re still fighting that battle. It’s a tremendous battle, tremendous war also, but we’re fighting it here. As you know, in 10 years, now it’s eight years because I started it. It should have been started long before I got here because they had the answer even before, but we’re fighting that battle. We’ll be AIDS free in approximately eight years. It looks like that is going to happen. We’re spending a lot of money, but we’re spending a lot of money with other countries. If you look at the aid that we give to other countries, we give billions and billions and billions of dollars to other countries, and a lot of times I say, “You know, we could save a lot of money. We shouldn’t have,” and then they come in. I say, “What’s it used for?”"
2020-03-22,01:29:15,Donald Trump,"It’s used to fight malaria in countries that are very poor. It’s used to fight AIDS in Africa. It’s used to fight many other things, many other things. And I don’t think I’ve ever said, “No, I can’t.” It’s just so terrible. Countries that we have, really, we’re not involved with them very much other than there would be tremendous death, tremendous death. I mean, you can get a list and I could get you a list. We give away billions of dollars to other countries, and we are giving away a lot in terms of everything, and probably we’ll end up doing economically doing something for other countries. But when I’m presented with these lists, that yes sir, in Africa, we’re fighting AIDS, or fighting something else. I tell you what, I start off by saying, “You know, we should say we could save a lot of money,” and then by the time they walk those lists into my office, I say, “We have to keep doing that.” That’s humanity you’re talking. How about one more question? Yes."
2020-03-22,01:30:11,Unnamed,"Sir, thank you. I want to ask you about the states that have not yet issued stay at home orders. So in Texas for example, the hospitals have said that they expect to run out of beds by the end of April if the Governor does not issue a at home order. Dallas county just announced an order. It’s very, it’s not-"
2020-03-22,01:30:29,Donald Trump,"Well, states have to go, that’s a great Governor. You’re talking about Greg Abbott in Texas, and he’s a great Governor, and he knows what he’s doing. A lot of the areas that he’s talking about, a lot of the counties he’s talking about are not very strongly affected. It’s a very different kind of a place and a great place, but I have total confidence in Governor Greg Abbott."
2020-03-22,01:30:48,Unnamed,So you’re okay with the lack of uniformity [crosstalk 00:18:52].
2020-03-22,01:30:51,Donald Trump,"Yeah, sure, because every state is different. Every state is different. I mean, Idaho, West Virginia, Iowa, Nebraska are much different than New York, than California, Los Angeles as an example, or San Francisco, they’re much different. I mean, it’s much different. The hotspots right now are state of Washington, and probably number one by far right now is New York. That’s the hotspot like no other hotspot, and California’s a hotspot. But New York right now is the leader. There’s no question. All right, final question."
2020-03-22,01:31:27,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Your administration is backing a lawsuit to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. So given that people are losing their jobs now and need healthcare more than ever, would you consider rethinking your position on that?"
2020-03-22,01:31:38,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s a lawsuit coming out of Texas again, that was headed up by Texas, and what we want to do is get rid of the bad healthcare and put in a great healthcare, and we will always, I will say this, I can make this commitment to you, the Republican party is fully backing preexisting conditions. Now, if we could get a great healthcare plan, which would need the House to do, but if we can get a great healthcare plan, we will only do it if we have preexisting conditions totally backed. So we’re back in preexisting, but we’d like to get rid of bad health healthcare. Now, we are running the bad healthcare much better than it was ever run and we’re making it better. But it could be much better than it is. And so what we want to do is terminate it, have a great healthcare, but we will only do it with preexisting. We will back preexisting conditions."
2020-03-22,01:32:24,Unnamed,But what if the [crosstalk 00:20:26]-
2020-03-22,01:32:25,Donald Trump,Thank you all very much. Thank you. We’ll be back. We’ll have a meeting tomorrow. [ inaudible 00:01:32:30].
2020-03-22,01:32:34,Unnamed,"Mario [inaudible 01:32:34] , not Jose, if you wanted to clarify that. You had said Jose. Works for us."
2020-03-22,01:32:37,Donald Trump,"[inaudible 01:32:37] Oh, did it take? I watched Jose on NBC the other night. Okay."
2020-03-22,01:32:42,Unnamed,Thank you. Donate blood. Donate blood. We need it.
2020-03-23,00:00,Donald Trump,"Well, thank you very much, and I see we have fewer people because of the virus problem, and we appreciate you being here. This is getting to be more and more social distancing and that’s fine, that’s the way it should be, and it’s too bad. We extend our best wishes to the person affected and we feel sure that he or she will be better very soon."
2020-03-23,00:42,Donald Trump,"Thank you for being here. America continues to mobilize every segment of our society to turn the tide in the battle against the virus. I want Americans to know that we will get through this challenge, the hardship will end, it will end soon, normal life will return and our economy will rebound very, very strongly, but right now in the midst of this great national trial, Americans must remain united in purpose and focused on victory. To every single American, please know that the sacrifice you’re making at this time is saving lives many, many lives."
2020-03-23,01:23,Donald Trump,"It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They’re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. They’re working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together. It’s very important. From the beginning, we have been working closely with our nation’s best scientists and medical professionals and we will continue to do so until we have defeated the virus. Our public health experts, who are terrific, are studying the variation in the disease across the country and we will be using data to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time. We also have a large team working on what the next steps will be once the medical community gives a region the okay, meaning the okay to get going, to get back “Let’s go to work.”"
2020-03-23,02:25,Donald Trump,"Our country wasn’t built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down. My administration continues to work with Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement on an urgent relief bill for the millions of American workers, and small businesses and large businesses that were badly affected by the medical difficulty that we’ve had. If you had a viable business in January, we are committed to ensuring the same is true in the coming weeks. In fact, we want to make it even better than it was before and we’re doing things to help in that regard. America will again, and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner."
2020-03-23,03:18,Donald Trump,"We can not let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem. At the end of the 15 day period we’ll make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing, and essentially we’re referring to the timing of the opening, essentially the opening of our country, because we have it pretty well shut down in order to get rid of this invisible enemy."
2020-03-23,03:46,Donald Trump,"Two weeks ago we moved at record speed to pass paid sick leave and paid family medical leave, and approved $8 billion including money for the development of treatments and vaccines, and we’re doing tremendous work in both, on both fronts. The vaccines are coming along very quickly. Now, Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written and avoid playing anymore partisan games. They have to get together and just stop with the partisan politics, and I think that’s happening. I got a call a little while ago, I guess they’re getting closer. It should go quickly, and it must go quickly. It’s not really choice. They don’t have a choice, they have to make a deal. This should not be a time for political agendas, but rather one for focusing solely and squarely on the needs of the American people. We are going to save American workers and we’re going to save them quickly, and we’re going to save our great American companies, both small and large. This was a medical problem, we are not going to let it turn into a long lasting financial problem."
2020-03-23,05:01,Donald Trump,"It started out as a purely medical problem and it’s not going to go beyond that. We’re just not going to allow that to happen. Our country was at its strongest financial point, we’ve never had an economy like we had just a few weeks ago, and then it got a hit with something that nobody could have ever thought possible, and we are fixing it. We’re fixing it quickly, and I want to just thank the American people for what they’ve been through and what they’re doing. Our country will be stronger than ever before and we fully anticipate that, and it won’t be that long."
2020-03-23,05:39,Donald Trump,"Let me provide you with an update on critical supplies. FEMA is distributing 8,000,095 respirator masks and 13.3 million surgical masks across the country right now, focusing on the areas with the greatest need. We have shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York City and 36 pallets to the state of Washington. In the past 96 hours, FEMA has also received donations of approximately 6.5 million masks. We’re having millions and millions of masks made as we speak, and other personal protective equipment which we will be distributing to medical hotspots. We’re focused on some of the hotspots across the nation. We’re seeing an outpouring of creativity and innovative ideas widely shared between the federal health leaders, governors and mayors, the scientific community and members of the private sector really working together. Everybody’s working together."
2020-03-23,06:41,Donald Trump,"I’m pleased to report that clinical trials in New York will begin existing for existing drugs that may prove effective against the virus. At my direction, the federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of flororoquin, and you can look from any standpoint tomorrow in New York, we think tomorrow pretty early. The hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak, I think as a combination probably is looking very, very good and it’s going to be distributed. We have 10,000 units going, and it’ll be distributed tomorrow. It’ll be available, and it is now. They already have it. They’re going to distribute it tomorrow morning to a lot of people in New York City and New York. We’re studying it very closely, watching it very closely. You probably saw a couple of articles today came out where a gentleman, they thought he was not going to make it, he said goodbye to his family, they had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over. His family thought he was going to die, and a number of hours later he woke up, felt good. Then he woke up again and he felt really good, and he’s in good shape, and he’s very happy for this particular drug that we got approved in record setting time."
2020-03-23,08:16,Donald Trump,"There’s never been anything even close to it, and I want to thank the FDA, which has been incredible, and Dr. Hahn, Stephen Hahn, a highly respected man, but they’re doing everything possible to increase production and available supply of these drugs, not only this drug but also others that are coming. Remdesivir is coming from Regeneron, a couple of others are also under study, but the one that I’m very excited about right now is the one we just mentioned, and I think there’s a real chance, I mean, again, we don’t know, but there’s a real chance that it could have a tremendous impact. It would be a gift from God if that worked. It would be a big game changer, so we’ll see, but distribution starts tomorrow morning early in New York and I think a lot of people are going to be, hopefully they’re going to be very happy with the result, but we’re all going to be watching closely. It’s something we have to try. It’s been very, very successful on Malaria, very, very successful, and countries with Malaria have had an interesting thing happen. They take this particular drug, it’s a very powerful drug, and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries, and there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the Malaria, so we’ll see what happens."
2020-03-23,09:44,Donald Trump,I’m also announcing that we’re postponing the deadline for compliance with real ID requirements at a time when we’re asking Americans to maintain social distancing. We do want to require people to go with their local DMV. We will be announcing the new deadline very soon. It’s going to be announced in a very short moment.
2020-03-23,10:11,Donald Trump,"Over night, we successfully brought home 103 American citizens after they had been stranded for 10 days in Brazil following a cruise. We want to thank the Brazilian government and their great president. Most of those returned were senior citizens. My administration, in cooperation with Governor Greg Abbott of Texas and the private sector coordinated their safe return to the United States, so thank you to Governor Abbott, a terrific governor, terrific man."
2020-03-23,10:41,Donald Trump,"Earlier today I signed an executive order invoking presidential authority under Section 45-12 of the Defense Production act to prohibit the hoarding of vital medical equipment and supplies such as hand sanitizers, face masks and personal protective equipment. We have a lot of face masks, a lot of equipment just coming in, and we have some people hoarding, and Attorney General Barr’s going to be speaking about that in a second. We want to prevent price gouging and critical health and medical resources are going to be protected in every form. Under this directive the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to designate essential health and medical supplies as scarce, so he’ll designate certain supplies and medical elements as scarce, and that means it will be a crime to stockpile these items in excessive quantities, which is happening to a relatively small degree we think, but nevertheless, it’s happening. We can’t let it happen, and we can’t let them resell them at excessive prices, which some people are doing. Very simply, will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit, so we’re going to be watching that with our great Attorney General very closely."
2020-03-23,12:05,Donald Trump,"The Department of Justice will be aggressively prosecuting fraudulent schemes related to the pandemic. Yesterday, federal prosecutors took action in their first case, shutting down a website selling a totally fake vaccine, if you can believe that one. As president, I will always fight to protect Americans from being exploited. Thankfully, all throughout the country we’re witnessing extraordinary acts of compassion, benevolence and unity. Construction companies are donating masks by the hundreds of thousands, manufacturing workers are transforming their assembly lines, citizens are volunteering to deliver food and medicine to the elderly, we’re truly seeing America at its best. We’re really seeing things that people never thought even could happen. Frankly, we never thought this could happen, but the way most Americans are working toward getting it solved and just doing what they have to do to make this go away has been incredible. It’s been incredible."
2020-03-23,13:12,Donald Trump,"I want to take a moment to thank the everyday heroes who are making our vast effort against the virus possible, and thank you to the healthcare workers and the first responders. These are very brave people. Thanks also to the hardworking men and women of Federal Express, UPS, the United States Postal Service, and the truckers who are maintaining our supply chains and supply lines. We thank you very much. Great job. We also want to give our regards and thanks to everyone at our grocery stores working the night shift so that shelves can be restocked, and the restaurant workers and delivery drivers keeping our families fed. So many of these restaurants, it’s incredible. They’re doing a service where people come and they pick it up, delivery. It’s been incredible what they’ve been doing. A totally different business than they were in, other than they cook food. Other than that, it’s like a totally different business."
2020-03-23,14:13,Donald Trump,"Most of all, I want to thank the American people for rising to the challenge and showing incredible courage, determination, patience, grace and grit. From New York to Seattle and everywhere in between, your acts of selflessness, and sacrifice and ingenuity are a powerful testament to the American character. It’s really being shown. It’s really showing up at a level that people are really respecting. All over the world, they’re respecting, and the world has problems. We’re 148 countries now. 148 countries are affected by the invisible scourge, and all of the uplifting reflections of the American spirit are out there for everyone to see. Together, we will care for our fellow citizens and we will win this war, and we’ll win it much sooner than people think and we’ll be back in business as a country pretty soon. You’ll be hearing about that also pretty soon."
2020-03-23,15:17,Donald Trump,"Now, I’d like to ask Attorney General Bill Barr to say a few words, and we’ll take questions in a little while. Thank you."
2020-03-23,15:34,Attorney General Barr,"Let me start by thanking you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President for your decisive leadership in this unprecedented battle to save American lives. At the Department of Justice we’re working hard to protect the health and safety of our personnel, while at the same time keeping our enforcement efforts at full throttle, so I’d like to thank all of my colleagues in law enforcement, not just those at the federal level, but of all our state and local partners, the police officers, the Sheriff’s deputies who are protecting and serving their communities, often at great risk to themselves."
2020-03-23,16:16,Attorney General Barr,"What I’d like to do here is start with a few remarks about the order that the president mentioned to ensure the availability of critical medical and health supplies from hoarding and price gouging. On March 18th, the president issued Executive Order 13-9-0-9 invoking the Defense Production Act with respect to the health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID19, including PPE and ventilators. We have started to see some evidence of potential hoarding and price gouging, and so earlier today the president signed a second executive order providing the authority to address, if it becomes necessary, hoarding that threatens the supply of those necessary health and medical resources. Under Section 1-0-2 of the Defense Production act, the president is authorized to prohibit the hoarding of needed resources by designating those materials as scarce or as materials whose supply would be threatened by persons accumulating excessive amounts. Once specific materials are so designated, persons are prohibited from accumulating those items in excess of reasonable personal or business needs, or for the purpose of selling them in excess of prevailing market prices. It is a crime to engage in prohibited activity."
2020-03-23,17:55,Attorney General Barr,"In today’s executive order the president is delegating to the secretary of HHS this authority to protect against hoarding by designating these critical items. Now, no items have been designated yet, and the Department of Justice is going to be working with HHS to identify cases where a hoarding may be impeding the supply of health and medical resources needed to respond to the COVID19 pandemic. Today we convened our first task force meeting, a national task force that will be working on these supply chain issues, and specifically on the problem of hoarding and price gouging, and we are designating in each of our 93 United State’s attorney’s offices a lead prosecutor who will be responsible in that district for pursuing these cases. I also want to say that we have not waited for this order to be signed. We, as we have received evidence recently, we have already initiated investigations of activities that are disrupting the supply chain and suggestive of hoarding."
2020-03-23,19:09,Attorney General Barr,"I want to stress that we’re not talking about consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations, we’re talking about people hording these goods and materials on an industrial scale for the purpose of manipulating the market and ultimately deriving windfall profits. If you are, have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about, but if you are sitting on a warehouse with masks, surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door. So with that, Mr, President, I’ll turn it back to you."
2020-03-23,19:53,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, [inaudible 00:19:55]."
2020-03-23,19:53,Donald Trump,"Deborah? Deborah, please."
2020-03-23,19:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
2020-03-23,20:02,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Just to start, I want to really thank all the Ministers of Health around the world who have been sending us their data despite the fight that they’re in themselves, particularly our European colleagues. They continue to send us primarily their mortality data, which is really very critical, because when you’re in the midst of this level of fight than many of the European countries are, following mortality data will give you the best insight right now on how the epidemic is proceeding in those countries because they really can’t be testing at the level to really understand the depth and breadth of their new cases."
2020-03-23,20:37,Dr. Deborah Birx,"In the mortality data that has been provided to us there has been no child under 15 that has succumbed to the virus in Europe. There was the one 14 year in China, so we still see that there is less severity in children, and so that should be reassuring to the moms and dads out there. To Generation Z and to my millennial colleagues who have been really at the forefront of many of these responses, less than one percent of all the mortality is less than 50, and so, this is, I think, also a very important point. That doesn’t mean that individuals won’t have severe disease. So still, 99% of all the mortality coming out of Europe in general is over 50 and preexisting conditions. The preexisting condition piece still holds in Italy with the majority of the mortality having three or more preexisting conditions. I think this is reassuring to all of us, but it doesn’t change the need to continue to protect the elderly, and in order to protect the elderly we all need to continue to do the President’s directives and guidance for the next week of the 15 day challenge."
2020-03-23,21:48,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, I wanted to really close by thanking the laboratory personnel that had been at the front lines. 250,000 tests have been run in the last seven days. This happened because of these large commercial laboratories are doing round the clock runs, and remember all of them being, are being exposed to the virus in the same way from the swabs, yet tirelessly they have worked on and on to get those results available. They are still getting more tests than they can run per day. That’s because we are primarily expanded into the, what we call the Roshe high-throughput TriCore machine. Those results have been getting to the clients and we’ve asked them to prioritize hospitalized patients."
2020-03-23,22:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,"There was a breakthrough today, and I think you’ll see this from the FDA, and for all of those that you who are waiting for self swabbing options, those are going to be available at some time this week to be able to, individuals do their own tests. That said, remember these platforms are keeping up with those who need to be diagnosed in the hospitals and all those who come to the emergency room quite ill so that hospital beds can be freed up for those that don’t have COVID. So that will be critical, that if you don’t need a test and if it doesn’t change your clinical course, do not come in to be tested, and I think that mortality data that I gave you should be very reassuring to all of you."
2020-03-23,23:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, to conclude, New York City. The New York Metro area of New Jersey, New York City and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to one in a thousand. This is five times what the other areas are seeing. There, through the high-throughput lab investigations, we’re finding that 28% of the submitted specimens are positive from that area, where it’s less than 8% in the rest of the country. So to all of my friends and colleagues in New York, this is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self isolate at this time. Clearly, the virus had been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community."
2020-03-23,24:03,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Deborah. [inaudible 00:24:07]."
2020-03-23,24:07,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-23,24:10,Mike Pence,"The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but we also convened, at the president’s direction, a conference call with the nation’s governors, and we focused on efforts at mitigation, at testing and supplies. We discussed the president’s or recent approval of disaster declarations for Washington, and California, and New York, but we also assured governors who’ve submitted major disaster declarations that we will be reviewing them in an expeditious manner to ensure the full resources of the federal government are brought to bear. The president wanted us to make it clear that the federal government will do whatever it takes to support an effort that is locally executed, state managed and federally supported. We reiterated that to our governors today, listened to them about their specific needs, and frankly made it clear to them that while the president has published at coronavirus.gov the 15 days to slow the spread for every American, and millions of Americans are addressing these common sense guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the days ahead, we made it clear to the governors that this president and this administration fully supports decisions that governors are making in communities and states that are particularly impacted by the spread of the coronavirus and we are grateful for their efforts."
2020-03-23,25:43,Mike Pence,"We also spoke to the governors about the importance of the legislation that is currently being negotiated on Capitol Hill and asked them to encourage members of the House and the Senate to move very quickly. The bill that is currently being negotiated, the president said that he believes will be resolved soon. We’re encouraged by it. We’ll speed direct payments to families. The average family of four will receive $3,000 directly. There’ll be payroll subsidies for small businesses around America to keep people on the payroll while they might be required to stay home, unemployment insurance benefits, assistance to hospitals and major industries, and we continue to urge the Congress to act and ask the governors to engage their delegations."
2020-03-23,26:32,Mike Pence,"On the subject of testing, we reiterated our thanks to states across the country that are rapidly expanding testing at drive through sites and at community sites, and as Dr. Birx just reflected, because of the unprecedented public and private partnership that the president initiated with our commercial labs we stand here today with 313,000 tests having been completed with the test results delivered to Americans, and still somewhat more than 41,000 have contracted coronavirus, but the state run effort is continuing to receive the full support of our team at FEMA and at the US Public Health Service. We’re deploying personnel, we’re deploying resources, and testing is literally expanding around the country by the hour. As Dr. Birx also mentioned, the FDA has been in the process of reviewing less invasive methods of testing. The president and I both reflected on the fact that we have been tested, and we’ve been working with the FDA to make it possible for self collected nasal swabs where individuals could, at the end of their nasal passage, collect a sample, and I’m pleased to report that self collected swabs can now be collected in clinics and at drive through testing sites …"
2020-03-23,28:03,Mike Pence,"Self-collected swabs can now be collected in clinics and at drive-thru testing sites. This will expedite the testing process, of course, but it will also reduce the risk to healthcare providers for exposure to the coronavirus and it will minimize the drain on personal protective equipment. With the current test that goes pretty significantly up the nasal passage, people have to wear gear and then change out the gear. This new self-administered test will actually not require the drain on personal protective equipment. It’s all a part of our effort, as Admiral Polowczyk will discuss in just a few moments, to meet the supply needs that we have across the country, but to meet them with efforts at conservation as well."
2020-03-23,28:50,Mike Pence,"On the subject of testing, it’s important to remember as the old book says, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.” And so if you don’t have symptoms, you don’t need to get a coronavirus test. We encourage every American to adhere to that so that the testing resources are available for people that are symptomatics."
2020-03-23,29:13,Mike Pence,"We also will be issuing today from Health and Human Services new guidance to direct all commercial labs to prioritize testing for hospitalized patients, and that guidance is going out tonight. We also reminded the governors today that all state laboratories, all hospital laboratories are now required by law to report the results of coronavirus tests to the CDC."
2020-03-23,29:40,Mike Pence,"On the subject of supplies in our meeting today at FEMA, we received a report of the new supply chain stabilization task force. Rear Admiral John Polowczyk is leading that up at FEMA and the task force is working to identify medical supplies that exist in the marketplace today to evaluate the national stockpile and also working with industries around the country to produce even more of the critical medical supplies."
2020-03-23,30:11,Mike Pence,"And as the president said, businesses across America are stepping up, and maybe as never before in our history. 3M, in fact, has diverted 500,000 N95 masks from commercial customers and they’re being delivered today to New York and Seattle. Facebook, we would acknowledge is donated their emergency reserve of over 700,000 N95 masks to healthcare workers, and these are just a few examples of the generosity of businesses."
2020-03-23,30:40,Mike Pence,"We’re also seeing companies step forward to repurpose their manufacturing facilities to create ventilators to create equipment. And I know I speak for the President, when I say how grateful and proud we are for that."
2020-03-23,30:54,Mike Pence,"We also discussed with the governors a real breakthrough on the availability of ventilators. We called on the governors to survey all outpatient surgical centers and hospital operating rooms because surgical ventilators that anesthesiologists use because of an FDA decision rendered this last weekend, those can be easily converted now to ventilators that can be used for people struggling with severe illness from the coronavirus. And so we called on our governors and conversations with state leaders to survey all of their surgical centers and hospital operating rooms to identify that equipment. And with the new FDA guidelines, they’ll be able to convert those to help meet the needs of ventilators across the country."
2020-03-23,31:45,Mike Pence,"We are now eight days into the President’s 15 days to slow the spread. The American people are rising to the challenge. We’re doing this. But in the days that remain between now and the end of the 15 days, we’re going to need every American to take this seriously. Listen to your state and local health authorities where there may be additional and stronger guidance in areas where the coronavirus spread has been more severe."
2020-03-23,32:09,Mike Pence,"But for every American know that the part that you do, that your family does, that you do in your community to put into practice these principles of social distancing, using a drive through at the local restaurant, will make an enormous difference in lowering the trajectory of the coronavirus spreading across our country. It’s going to take all of us, but with the ongoing cooperation of the American people with compassion, with the ingenuity of American industry, with dedicated leadership at the state and federal level, I know that we can slow the spread, we can protect our most vulnerable and we will heal our land."
2020-03-23,32:55,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike."
2020-03-23,32:56,John Polowczyk,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. So I’m Rear Admiral John Polowczyk. I’m the supply chain task force lead at FEMA. My task is to increase the supply of critical medical supplies, which include personal protective equipment and ventilators, items like that. I just want to take a few moments to explain the organization that we’ve stood up this week, these the last few days, and our approach."
2020-03-23,33:26,John Polowczyk,"We have a chart behind me. I have two focus leads, one on personal protective equipment, medical supplies; and a focus lead on ventilators."
2020-03-23,33:40,John Polowczyk,"Operating under four lines of effort: First line of effort you see is preservation, and leaders tonight I’ve talked about that ability to make our stuff lasts longer."
2020-03-23,33:52,John Polowczyk,"Acceleration, we have a team of people that are searching globe for personal protective equipment. Figuring out where it is, figuring out if we need to buy it or just transport it and get it here faster."
2020-03-23,34:07,John Polowczyk,"We have a line of effort called reallocation. We’re working with our industry partners to illuminate the supply chain. There are many vendors, many distributors, all on separate system. Nobody has one sight picture for that supply chain. We’ve brought our industry partners in. We’re weaving that together to make better allocation decisions and understand where it is and where it needs to go."
2020-03-23,34:36,John Polowczyk,"We have a line called expansion. You’ve heard some of that today. If those that have wanted to convert plants, those that want to get into the business, we have the tools to help them to go do that."
2020-03-23,34:50,John Polowczyk,"Two focus areas right now, PPE and ventilators. Four lines of effort working the problem of the task to get more here and increase the supplies. Thank you, sir."
2020-03-23,35:03,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
2020-03-23,35:04,John (Reporter),"Thank you, Mr. President. If I could, the Washington Post is reporting that total deaths today crossed 100 for the first time. This morning, your surgeon general on The Today Show said he wanted Americans to understand that this is going to get really bad. Do you share that prognosis?"
2020-03-23,35:20,Donald Trump,"Of course I do. It’s going to be bad and we have a lot of people dying from the flu. As you know, we have a very bad flu season on top of everything else. It’s very bad. It looks like it could be over 50,000, and certainly this is going to be bad. We’re trying to make it so that it’s much, much less bad and that’s what we’re doing. I think we’re doing a very good job of it."
2020-03-23,35:44,Donald Trump,"If you look at other countries, what they’ve been through, and you look at the kind of numbers and compare them to ours, which is a much larger country than most, the numbers are pretty amazing. And it started with the fact that we stopped people from coming in from a highly infected area and that was a good thing to do. So yeah, it’s bad and obviously the numbers are going to increase with time, and then they’re going to start to decrease."
2020-03-23,36:12,Donald Trump,"And we’re going to be opening our country up for business because our country was meant to be open and working with others but especially for our workers. And the engine for that whole system is we have to have companies and these companies are loved by our workers because they’re paying big salaries and big dollars to our workers. And we’re going to get it all going again very soon, hopefully very, very soon."
2020-03-23,36:43,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-23,36:43,Unnamed,"Sir, I’m just trying to reconcile the two things that you just said. One that things are going to be very, very bad; and two, that you want to get the country opened back up as quickly as possible. I guess my question is if in a week Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauchi are telling you we need to continue these measures for the health of the vulnerable populations of the country, are you going to say, “I’m sorry, the economy is too important.”"
2020-03-23,37:12,Donald Trump,"Well, you’ll see what happens. I understand the question very well. It’s a great question, but we can do two things at one time. I will say this, our country’s learned a lot. We’ve learned about social distancing. We’ve learned about the hands, we’ve learned about staying away at least during the time that this is even a little bit around this disease or whatever you want to call it. Many different names, you can go up many different names, but the virus while it’s around."
2020-03-23,37:43,Donald Trump,"And we can start thinking about, as an example, parts of our country are very lightly effected, very small numbers. You look at a state, great governor, Pete Ricketts in Nebraska. You look at the kind of numbers they have out there. They have one of the great hospitals there too, relative to what we’re talking about. But you look at Nebraska, you look at Idaho, you look at Iowa. I could name many countries that are handling it very, very well and that are not affected to the same extent or frankly not even nearly to the extent of New York. I’m dealing with the Governor Cuomo and we’re dealing very well together. We’ll be sending that ship up, by the way, as you know. We have a ship going to Los Angeles. The ship is coming out of a very large repair, so ready to go or very soon will be. And over the next three or four weeks that’ll be coming up to New York. We’ll go to New York Harbor and it’ll be fully supplied, so they’re working on that right now."
2020-03-23,38:54,Unnamed,And maybe Dr. Birx can speak to this. Do you share the President’s optimism that in a week we might have a situation where we can say there’s a few hotspots but much of the country’s [crosstalk 00:39:04]
2020-03-23,39:04,Donald Trump,"Well, I didn’t say a week, but I said soon. It’s going to be a soon. It’s not going to be three or four months as some people were saying and a lot of people thought originally, but I would certainly let you answer."
2020-03-23,39:14,Unnamed,"Yeah, and are you worried that some cities and states that haven’t had the infection yet are lagging indicators and that we’re going to start seeing cases?"
2020-03-23,39:24,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You’ve raised two important issues. One, I think you all know, a lot of our tests have had to go to hospitals at this time so that we can diagnose people who are at risk to give them options to get these new therapeutic options. None of these therapeutic options are available if you don’t know your diagnosis, so we’ve been very much focused on that. With adding Abbott, Thermo Fisher, Hologic and now Cepheid platforms… Cepheids that new platform that is point of care but slower so you’ve got to match the throughput, the need to what kind of equipment you have. Now that we have all those platforms moving simultaneously, we can go back to doing case finding and surveillance in the areas that have the most lower numbers as well as doing mitigation more aggressively in the places that have higher numbers."
2020-03-23,40:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We went out with a very blunt force. I mean we have to all be honest, we had to do that because we weren’t sure where the virus was and where it is going. I think over this week we’re concentrated on figuring out exactly where the virus is and making projections about where it’s going and the impact of our mitigation pieces. We learned this in tackling epidemics around the world, you have to focus the resources and the intervention and the structural prevention interventions in the areas where the virus is circulating. Otherwise, people never understand why you’re doing this and they don’t have any virus. It has to be very tailored geographically and it may have to also be very tailored by age group, really understanding who’s at the greatest risks and understanding how to protect them."
2020-03-23,41:02,Unnamed,"But there’s data showing that in three months, as the president said, we won’t need to follow these broad guidelines that he’s laid out."
2020-03-23,41:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The only data that we all have, and I think you all know what it is, the two areas that have moved through their curve is China and South Korea. Those are the two countries that we’re learning from. Those were eight to 10 week curves. Each state in each hot spot in the United States is going to be its own curve because the seeds came in at different times. Washington state is on their curve. They’re about two weeks ahead of New York. And so each of these have to be done in a very granular way to really understand where we are. It’s the charge that the president has given us is to use all of our data analytics and all of our data inputs to really define those issues about where the virus is, where is it going, and what predictions we can make about where we are in that bell-shaped curve."
2020-03-23,42:07,Donald Trump,"I think that’s a great definition, and I will say we’re going to be watching our senior citizens very closely. We’re going to be watching certain hotspots like New York, and within New York you have areas which are troubling and we’ll be working with the governor and the mayor and everybody else on those spots."
2020-03-23,42:25,Donald Trump,"But at the same time, at a certain point, we have to get open and we have to get moving. We don’t want to lose these companies. We don’t want to lose these workers. We want to take care of our workers, so we’ll be doing something I think relatively quickly, but we’ve learned a lot during this period. This was a very necessary period. Tremendous information was gained, but we can do two things at one time."
2020-03-23,42:50,Donald Trump,"And again, I say, we have a very active flu season, more active than most. It’s looking like it’s heading to 50,000 or more deaths, deaths not cases. 50,000 deaths, that’s a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we’re talking about. That doesn’t mean we’re going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. We have to do things to get our country open. But this has been an incredible period of learning and we’ll have announcements over the next fairly short period as to the timing. John, please."
2020-03-23,43:26,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, I want to ask you about these guidelines on testing. Obviously, Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for coronavirus, but he was not in contact with anybody who was a known positive and he didn’t have any major symptoms. Under your guidelines, under the guidelines that have been outlined here, he would not have gotten a test. He got one anyway. What do you say to him? He’s pointed out that if he hadn’t gone basically in defiance of these guidelines and got tested, he might still be showing up to the Senate right now and infecting the whole US Senate."
2020-03-23,43:56,Donald Trump,Yeah. I’ll let you answer him.
2020-03-23,43:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That’s why this was important. That’s why this recommendation to the American people was important because we have been saying that there is a level of asymptomatic or mild spread, and that’s why each person has to be responsible. Each person has to be responsible in the way that they decrease their interaction with others, the six feet, and you’re all very social distanced so thank you."
2020-03-23,44:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But also assuming that everyone that you’re interacting with could be positive. And that gets into the hand washing piece. And that gets into the other piece we talked about is surfaces. I think until we really figure out the respiratory transmission versus the surface transmission. And this hard surface transmission, not fabric, will be really critical because that is a way the virus could spread on subways, our metros, where people would be holding on to things that other people had recently held onto, so that’s the real question."
2020-03-23,45:03,John (Reporter),"But if we can just with the example of Rand Paul, and obviously there are many other people that would be in a similar situation, but just keep with this one example. If he hadn’t gotten that test, he would still be showing up to the Senate every day, to his place of work."
2020-03-23,45:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Following these guidelines, he wouldn’t have been infecting others because of the social distancing, washing your hands, doing everything that we talked about. We’ve talked about also how people make choices because of their jobs that they have to come in. You’ll notice I was not here over the weekend. I think this is the part that we really need to take personal responsibility for. Saturday, I had a little low grade fever-"
2020-03-23,45:43,Donald Trump,Uh-oh.
2020-03-23,45:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,"… so actually probably a GI thing, but I’m meticulous. I’m a physician. I looked it up. I’m from Walter Reed, so I got a test late Saturday night and I’m negative. I stayed home another day just-"
2020-03-23,46:02,Donald Trump,Whew. Thank you for saying that. Thank you very much.
2020-03-23,46:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"… Yeah, just to make sure. That’s how we protect one another. Unless everybody’s taking their temperature every day, we can’t say that he had no symptoms. These are the kinds of things that we have to do for one another. This is the personal responsibility that I’m talking about that we all have to practice."
2020-03-23,46:23,John (Reporter),"Hey, Mr. President, when you say you didn’t want the cure to be worse than the problem itself, are you saying that if we kept these measures that we’re doing now in place for a couple of months to a few months-"
2020-03-23,46:37,Donald Trump,"Well, they will be in place. At some point, we’re going to open up our country and it’s going to be fairly soon."
2020-03-23,46:42,John (Reporter),Weeks or months? Because you seem to be [crosstalk 00:18:45].
2020-03-23,46:46,Donald Trump,"I’m not looking at months, I can tell you right now. We’re going to be opening up our country and we’re going to be watching certain areas and we’re going to be practicing everything that Deborah is referring to right here. I mean, we’re going to be watching this very closely, but you can’t keep it closed for years, okay."
2020-03-23,47:06,Donald Trump,"This is going away. We’re going to win the battle, but you have tremendous responsibility. We have jobs. We have people get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicides over things like this. When you have terrible economies, you have death probably, and I mean definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus. We have an obligation. We have a double obligation."
2020-03-23,47:38,Donald Trump,"We have a great country. There is no country like it in the world and there’s no economy like it in the world. I mean, we were just blazing. We were coming out with numbers that some numbers weren’t even reported because this had happened. They were meaningless. I got numbers about myself that were meaningless. Because by the time the numbers came in, it’s a whole different world with this."
2020-03-23,47:58,Donald Trump,"But I will tell you that we can do both things, John. We can do them both at the same time. I mean, that’s okay. What we have gone through is a tremendous learning process and we’ve also solved a lot of problems. But we’ve gone through a tremendous learning situation. Now, we’re building hospitals in New York. We’re building hospitals in California. We’re building hospitals in the state of Washington. We’ve been in touch with the governors. Today I spoke with a man that I happened to like. I spoke with Phil in New Jersey and where we’re going to be doing something very meaningful in New Jersey. We’re doing something… I spoke with, JB Pritzker called me today. We’re going to be helping them out in Illinois. We’re doing a lot of things in Florida."
2020-03-23,48:46,Donald Trump,"We’re doing a lot of things between FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Admiral in your group in terms of the purchasing, that’s what he does. He purchases. He supposed to be great. I’ll tell you in about two days, but he’s going to do a fantastic job. We have an incredibly talented group of people. But yeah, we’ll be doing two things and three things at one time."
2020-03-23,49:11,Donald Trump,"Well, at the same time though, we’re going to be watching very closely the hotspots. We’re going to be taking care and watching very closely our senior citizens, especially those with a problem or an illness. We’re going to be watching them very, very closely; and we can do that and have an open economy, have an open country. And we have to do that because that causes other problems and maybe it causes much bigger problems than the problem we’re talking about now. You understand. Jeff, please."
2020-03-23,49:37,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, following up on that same topic and on your tweet, do you think that the cure so far has been worse than the problem?"
2020-03-23,49:45,Donald Trump,"I think the cure has been very tough. This has been very tough. This was an operation. This was somebody going to a doctor and saying, “You need an operation,” and we’ve had an operation. We’ve learned a lot and we fixed a lot of problems. One of the things we fixed is if you look at the absolute system that this administration inherited, it wasn’t meant for this. It was meant for a small group of people; and even for that, it was not very good and very obsolete."
2020-03-23,50:14,Donald Trump,"We have a testing program now that will hopefully be able to be used for many years into the future should we have another event like this. I don’t think you’ll have another event like this. This is very unique. You look back into time, you look back decades and decades. We can name them all. Even if you go back 10 years, you know you go back to ’09, but that wasn’t like this as it turned out. But they lost a lot of people. We were early. We were early,, Jeff because of the fact that we closed early. That was a big move. Please, [Kristin 00:50:47]. Yeah, go ahead, Jim."
2020-03-23,50:48,Jim (Reporter),"I just want to follow that, sir. You had said previously, I think from this podium, that the virus could still be with us through July or August. By suggesting now that we might or that the government might change these standards or these recommendations to-"
2020-03-23,51:04,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s not change. No, we’re doing things… Yeah. This was a learning experience for the people of the country."
2020-03-23,51:09,Jim (Reporter),I’m just wondering if that time frame this has changed for you?
2020-03-23,51:12,Donald Trump,If what’s changed?
2020-03-23,51:13,Jim (Reporter),The July/August timeframe of when you think the virus will be under control?
2020-03-23,51:17,Donald Trump,"Well, I think we’ve learned a lot. I think that there’s so much discipline now that we never had. Nobody ever said don’t shake hands. I did actually before I became a politician. Once I became a politician then it’s hard getting used to not doing it because you do it with everybody. With literally thousands of people a week, you’re shaking hands with big groups of people."
2020-03-23,51:43,Donald Trump,"We’ve learned a lot. There’s a great discipline that this whole country has learned having to do with distancing, having to do with shaking hands. I think a lot of it’s going to stay long after the viruses go and I really think it’s probably good practice anyway, but I think it’s going to stay long after the virus has gone."
2020-03-23,51:59,Donald Trump,"We have to open our country because that causes problems that, in my opinion, could be far bigger problems, far bigger. Look, this is a severe medical situation that could cause problems far beyond the medical, and then increase the medical problems to things that had nothing to do with this original medical problem. We can’t let that happen to our country. We have the greatest country in the world. I’m not going to let that happen, but this two weeks that we have spent, has been an incredible learning period and process. Please, Kristin."
2020-03-23,52:34,Kristin,"Yeah, I have two questions for you. One, you said it’s likely going to be weeks, not months before you suggest easing these guidelines that you put out. Have any of the doctors on your team told you that’s the right path to pursue?"
2020-03-23,52:45,Donald Trump,"I spoke to them today and I was telling them that we have two things to look forward. Don’t forget the doctors, if it were up to the doctors, they may say let’s keep it shut down. Let’s shut down the entire world. Because, again, you’re up to almost 150 countries, so let’s shut down the entire world. And when we shut it down, that would be wonderful and let’s keep it shut for a couple of years. You know you can’t do that and you can’t do that with a country, especially the number one economy anywhere in the world by far. Number one economy in the world, you can’t do that."
2020-03-23,53:14,Kristin,So you’re saying-
2020-03-23,53:15,Donald Trump,"Well, it causes bigger problems than the original. That’s why I talk about the cure being worse than the problem. We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem. But what we have done… So this is not retracing, this isn’t anything. We’ve done it really well because this two-week period has been good and I’m not saying it ends at that time. We have another seven days or so. I’m not saying it ends at that time, but I am saying it’s been this incredible learning process. That’s going to go into the future. That’s going to go even as we open up our country. And we’re going to be watching New York and we’re going to be watching California, we’re going to be watching the state of Washington and other places. Illinois is becoming a hotspot, and we can do both."
2020-03-23,54:02,Donald Trump,"Now, we may quarantine… I mean we will be quarantining many people in these areas. There are other areas that just aren’t affected or they’re affected very little. And why would we close down 100% of the country? There are areas within New York where New York will be open, but there are areas within New York. Remember this, New York has the New York Stock Exchange. It has NASDAQ, it has the exchanges. To close the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ with all of the great work they’re doing. I mean, they’ve gone largely to computer. You look at the floor, it’s incredible what they can do, but it’s fully open. But we don’t want to be doing that."
2020-03-23,54:45,Donald Trump,"What I’m saying basically is that we can do two things simultaneously, and we’ve had this incredible learning period. Plus, people have been in a period and they won’t be calling, “Oh gee.” Because I’ve got many, many people that now come to me and say, “We get it. We think we can really do it now and do it while we’re open.” So at some point, we’ll be setting some guidelines, we’ll be setting some datelines and we’ll be announcing them in the not too distant future."
2020-03-23,55:12,Kristin,[inaudible 00:55:12] have any of the doctors on your team endorsed easing the federal guidelines.
2020-03-23,55:15,Donald Trump,"Well, not endorsed. We talked together, and I think they’re okay with it and I’m okay with it, but this could be a much bigger problem. This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you start off with. Now other nations are going to have to do what they’re going to do, but they’ll probably do something very similar."
2020-03-23,55:33,Donald Trump,"But in our case, much more so than anyone else, because of the magnitude of our economy, the tremendous size of what we’ve built and what we have and the jobs involved. You have almost 160 million jobs in this country now, the most ever by far, by far the most ever. The number of jobs, almost 160 million, so we can’t turn that off and think it’s going to be wonderful. They’ll be tremendous repercussions. There will be a tremendous death from that, death. You’re talking about death."
2020-03-23,56:03,Donald Trump,"Death from the death, you’re talking about death. Probably more death from that than anything that we’re talking about with respect to the virus."
2020-03-23,56:10,Unnamed (Reporter),[crosstalk 00:56:10] death if we continue with these strict guidelines than if we ease them?
2020-03-23,56:15,Donald Trump,"No, I think we’re going to do them both. I think that’s what I’m saying. I think we can do them both now. Now, we haven’t announced a date, but we’re getting fairly close to coming up with a date and it’s a much shorter period of time than I’ve been hearing the news report. And I think everybody should be happy with that, but great knowledge was gained. Please."
2020-03-23,56:34,Unnamed (Reporter),"I had two questions. I had two questions for you, Mr. President. My second one is on what your economic advisor, Larry Kudlow said today. He was talking about this and he said that there were going have to be some difficult trade-offs if you do use these guidelines because he wants the economy to [crosstalk 00:56:46]."
2020-03-23,56:46,Donald Trump,You mean with the Democrats you’re talking about?
2020-03-23,56:47,Unnamed (Reporter),"No, no. He was saying, he was talking about how you said, you know, the cure shouldn’t be worse than the problem, and he was talking about reopening the businesses, getting the economy, going back and going again. What are those difficult trade-offs?"
2020-03-23,56:58,Donald Trump,"Well, it is true. If he said… I didn’t hear him say that, but if he said, “Difficult trade-offs,” sure. It’s less convenient. Before you walk and you’d hop in the subway and you had grab the handle and you go down to wherever you’re going on Wall Street and you do all sorts of things and you go in and you open the doors going into your great buildings or into the exchanges and now you’re not going to have to… Maybe you think about doing that or you’re going to think about doing it a different way."
2020-03-23,57:23,Donald Trump,"No, no. There are many trade-offs. It’s a different life and maybe it will remain that way frankly after the invisible scourge is gone. Maybe it’s going to say that way. Not a bad thing to stay that way, but no, there are trade-offs. There’s no question about that, but I actually think it’s going to… I think in the end we’re going to end up being bigger, better and stronger. We have learned a lot. Please."
2020-03-23,57:45,Unnamed (Reporter),[inaudible 00:57:45] question is we’re seeing an increase of cases in Latin America and the Middle East-
2020-03-23,57:50,Donald Trump,That’s true. Latin America.
2020-03-23,57:51,Unnamed (Reporter),In some places in Asia. Are you considering a new round of travel ban?
2020-03-23,57:56,Donald Trump,"No, we’re not really. Something like that could happen, I guess, but we’re not really. They thought we were going to have bans within the United States. We didn’t do that. We’re not going to have that. Hopefully that’ll take care of itself. No ones, in Latin America, there is a, there’s been an uptick. Yeah, please."
2020-03-23,58:12,Unnamed (Reporter),"[crosstalk 00:02:15]. Mr. President, just quickly, a second question. What prompted you to say at the beginning of your beginning of your comments that you’re going to take care of the Asian Americans? Has there been something in particular that was [crosstalk 00:58:26] you?"
2020-03-23,58:26,Donald Trump,"Yeah, because it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all. These are incredible people. They love our country and I’m not going to let it happen. I just wanted to make that point."
2020-03-23,58:40,Unnamed (Reporter),Do you think you’re contradicted here?
2020-03-23,58:41,Donald Trump,Because they’re blaming China-
2020-03-23,58:43,Unnamed (Reporter),[crosstalk 00:58:43] Chinese virus?
2020-03-23,58:43,Donald Trump,People are blaming China. And they are making statements to great American citizens that happened to be of Asian heritage and I’m not going to let that happen. Please.
2020-03-23,58:54,Unnamed (Reporter),"You say you want to reopen the country, but most schools across the country are closed. Two States now are closed for the rest of the school year. How are parents supposed to go back to work and educate their children right now?"
2020-03-23,59:05,Donald Trump,"Yeah, the governors of the various states will have a lot of leeway. If we open up, and when we open up, the governors in certain states. For instance, you go to some of the states I just mentioned, those schools are going to be open. Many cases, they’re open now, but the schools are going to be open. In other cases, Governor Cuomo, Gavin Newsom, of California, certain governors are going to maybe have a decision to make. Now, they may make a decision to keep them open in a certain part of New York and maybe in Westchester County or wherever it may be, they’ll keep them closed."
2020-03-23,59:40,Donald Trump,But they’re going to have leeway. We giving the governors a lot of leeway.
2020-03-23,59:42,Unnamed (Reporter),Do you agree with the decision to close it several months out at this point? Because governors are saying they’re expecting a peak in the next couple of months and have the decision for the rest of the year.
2020-03-23,59:50,Donald Trump,The governors are going to make those decisions. That’s going to be up to the governors and they’re very capable. They’ll be able to make the decisions. Please.
2020-03-23,59:56,Unnamed (Reporter),"Sir, will you explain why a $2 trillion economic stimulus is needed if you are going to reopen the country in a period of weeks, not months?"
2020-03-23,01:00:05,Donald Trump,"Because the virus has had a big impact on our country, so we’re going to give a stimulus so that the workers can live their life. It was not their fault, it wasn’t the workers’ fault. And we are going to give a kick, so that it’s a kick. And this way we think the workers can get a fair start. The small businesses, we’re taking very good care of, we want to take care of these small businesses. They really are the engine of this country. A lot of people don’t know that. Everyone thinks of these great, big, beautiful businesses, who by the way have been very badly hurt also."
2020-03-23,01:00:41,Donald Trump,"But the small businesses have really, historically been the engine and they still are the engine of the country. And you’d be amazed. The workers love those businesses and the workers contact us and they want us to help those businesses because that’s where they’ve made their living."
2020-03-23,01:00:59,Donald Trump,"That’s where they’ve been paid a lot of money over the years. And you’ve been seeing what’s happened over the last three years, where salaries and wages have gone up very substantially for those workers. And then, we got caught by this sudden craziness coming into our country and coming all over the world. We need to make sure that the companies are strong and that the workers are strong and that’s what we’re doing. And hopefully, the Republicans and Democrats are going to be able to make a deal and they’re actually fairly close. But we’ll see what happens. Please."
2020-03-23,01:01:32,Unnamed (Reporter),[inaudible 01:01:32] But does it still need to don’t make me $2 trillion is my question. Can it be smaller at this point?
2020-03-23,01:01:35,Donald Trump,"Well, one of the things you’re going to have to save companies that have been shattered. You’re going to have to save a various, I mean, you know a lot of the companies yourselves, we have a company that was I think the greatest company in the world named Boeing. Boeing is going to need some help. Now, Boeing had some difficulty before. That’s unlike others. We have other companies that didn’t have a problem coming in. Boeing had the obvious problem that everybody knows about from a little more than a year ago, a double problem, and it was a big one."
2020-03-23,01:02:08,Donald Trump,"And then on top of it, as they’re getting ready to really show their stuff on top of it, we all get hit by this and obviously the airlines are going to have a problem, but the airlines aren’t going to be buying from Boeing or from anybody else right now because of this difficulty. We have to work with the airlines, we have to work with the cruise lines. We have to work with the companies like a Boeing because Boeing’s a potentially, again, a great company. Had a very rough period of 13 months, a very rough period, a horrible period. An unbelievable period."
2020-03-23,01:02:41,Donald Trump,"If you would’ve told me this would have happened to Boeing, I wouldn’t have believed it. Because to me it was truly one of the great, one of the truly great, probably almost one point of GDP if you can think of that’s hard to believe, that a company could have that kind of an impact. But Boeing, we have to work with it for two reasons."
2020-03-23,01:02:59,Donald Trump,"Number one, it’s a great company that we have to save. Number two, it produces unbelievable numbers of jobs. And so, the numbers have to be reflective of that kind of a thing. Please. You know what I’m going to do? We have wonderful people behind us that are working very hard and we want Bill to get back to the Department of Justice, so we want the admiral to start going and doing your job. And the same thing with Deb. If anybody would have any questions, maybe I’ll ask Mike to stay around, but if anybody would have any questions for the group and otherwise I’ll let them get back to work. Please."
2020-03-23,01:03:32,Unnamed (Reporter),"If we can just clarify with Dr. Birx, we seem to be talking about different geographical slopes on this. The curve would be changing. And yet you just said that 20% numbers coming out of New York gives an indication that we don’t quite know when the seeds, to use your metaphor, were planted. How confident are you on the start dates of each curve for each of the geographical areas that the president seems to be indicating, will be adjusting the policy for?"
2020-03-23,01:03:56,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That’s a very good question. What we do know, is now we can backtrack from people who get very seriously ill to when they probably got infected, versus when they were exposed. And so, when you start backing out each of those pieces, when you start seeing hospitalized patients, you know that the virus has probably been there for three to four weeks, substantially circulating within the population."
2020-03-23,01:04:21,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That’s what we’re looking for. Now, as all of our testing is improved and we want to really applaud the group who has worked on it. You know, if you look at the pandemic flu preparedness, all of this was built on a flu platform. It was never, ever thought that you’d have a simultaneous respiratory disease hitting at exactly the same time as your flu hits in the country. And so, when you are doing all of your flu surveillance, you could, had small cases of these pneumonias and flu-like illnesses characterized as a flu-like illness for the last four to six weeks."
2020-03-23,01:04:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so, that’s really a caution to all of us. And so, when we get through all of this, we’ll be looking at each of the pandemic preparedness plans. A long way of saying, we know Washington state is a little bit ahead of New York because of the hospitalization records. What we will get to as a country with the amount of testing that will be available is being able to do what the president talking about simultaneously. Simultaneously doing containment contract tracing, at the same time you’re doing mitigation."
2020-03-23,01:05:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And I think right now, we’ve put everything into mitigation. Yet if we geographically get specific data by zip codes and counties, we’ll be able to approach this in a very laser focused way, making sure that what we’re doing in each of those areas is absolutely appropriate for where they are in their own little bell-shaped curve."
2020-03-23,01:05:54,Unnamed (Reporter),Dr. Birx?
2020-03-23,01:05:54,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-03-23,01:05:56,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Birx, when will the government roll out the antibody tests so people can know possibly if they’ve been exposed?"
2020-03-23,01:06:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"All, several of them have come to the FDA, I believe. Obviously, that’s something I am very interested in for two reasons. One, it will give us a retrospective on where these infections were, who was actually infected and how really asymptomatic versus mild versus all of that comes into the spectrum. Secondly, by people who have high titers or those antibodies, those can become our solution with plasmapheresis for those in need. And the and the making of hyperimmune globulin. Knowing who they are becomes really critical."
2020-03-23,01:06:40,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But I think we’re still a couple of weeks out, I have to go back and talk to the FDA where each of these are because this is what saved us with when you do flu swabs, when you do strep throat swabs, and now where you could do an HIV test."
2020-03-23,01:06:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"These are the kinds of tests that we know will be critical in the future. I wanted to say one other thing, because you see a lot of numbers out there, about 70% of the population is going to get infected or 60% of the population based on those models. Understand that the way you get to that number is you do nothing. And it goes through three cycles. They’re talking about this cycle that we’re currently in, another cycle in 2021 and a third cycle in 2122, in order to get that level of population infected. And you know, we will have vaccines most likely by the 2122 season and we’re going to hopefully have therapeutics in the fall of the next season. The reason we’re so much focused on blunting the curve for this piece is if, if the virus comes back, we’ll have much more facility both for diagnosis, testing, monoclonal antibodies, treatments, and then the vaccine."
2020-03-23,01:07:55,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Birx, a question about the serology blood tests, which some people have said hold some real promise here. When will those be FDA approved and when would they be widely available?"
2020-03-23,01:08:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That’s what she was just asking about. These IgGs and IgM, both point of care, I can tell you it would be no problem making ELISA today, but then you’re drawing blood, you’re processing blood, you’re running plates. That’s what we did in the past. We really want a finger prick type assay where you can just put a fingerprint on and get your IgG and IgM, so that’s what we’re working on right now."
2020-03-23,01:08:32,Unnamed (Reporter),"Realistically, how long until that’s approved and available? Would you-"
2020-03-23,01:08:35,Dr. Deborah Birx,I can’t answer because I have to look at where each of the companies are that are in their development processes.
2020-03-23,01:08:42,Unnamed (Reporter),"It sounds like a while, then?"
2020-03-23,01:08:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, there’s some that are developed now that they were using in Singapore, so we’re looking at those to see how those work."
2020-03-23,01:08:51,Donald Trump,"We have some, it should be fairly quick."
2020-03-23,01:08:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,We’re looking at those. But you know we’re very quality oriented because we want to make sure we don’t give people false negatives or false positives.
2020-03-23,01:08:59,Donald Trump,"I have a question for you. We have a lot of very angry media all around this room and they want one of these seats, but because of social distancing, we are keeping them empty and they are keeping them empty. Will there ever be a time when all of those really angry, angry people who don’t like me much to start off with, but now they really don’t like me, will there ever be a time when these seats are full, like full to the brim like it used to be where people are almost sitting on each other’s lap?"
2020-03-23,01:09:32,Donald Trump,"And this whole row over here is packed and now they’re outside wanting to get in and they’re very jealous of all of these reporters. Will we ever have that again? Or is that something that will be, you know, it’ll look like this forever?"
2020-03-23,01:09:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,We’re learning a lot about social distancing and respiratory diseases.
2020-03-23,01:09:50,Donald Trump,Right?
2020-03-23,01:09:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And I think those are the discussions we have to have in the future. It was what you were talking about, changing our whole behavior patterns of what we touch and being conscious of that. I remember when I was worried Saturday morning, I was trying to think what all did I touch on Friday? Did I touch a door knob? Did I do this? Do I do that? Did I not wash my hands?"
2020-03-23,01:10:11,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I mean, you go through this whole piece, did I touched my face by accident? I think this, this awareness that we all now have that we didn’t have before, where we would have pushed through that door or turn that doorknob because we were in such a hurry. Now, I think all of us think twice. I think all of you think."
2020-03-23,01:10:28,Donald Trump,"But when the virus is gone, will the people be allowed to sit next to each other again, in your opinion in a tight room with a tight?"
2020-03-23,01:10:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I don’t know. You’ll have to look and see if we have a new respiratory piece. Certainly, this is the way we set up every clinic all around the world when we’re worried about TB and TB transmission."
2020-03-23,01:10:48,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Birx, I’m wondering if you could comment on the new measures that Britain has put into place. Also, Germany has said it doesn’t want to have crowds of less than two people except for families, which is a pretty restrictive number. Does that inform your thinking as you are coming up with advice for this next period for the president and the vice president?"
2020-03-23,01:11:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The president and vice president have asked us to look at every single scenario in every single country, because the more data we have, the more our decisions can be completely data informed and really understanding what impact that has. We’re interested right now, I mean, Italy obviously waited until about March 7th. The virus had been circulating for almost four weeks before actually going into that methodology, but for the first time it looks like their number, their mortality rates are starting to decline, which would be an illustration that things that they did two and three weeks ago may actually have an impact."
2020-03-23,01:11:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Those are the kinds of data we’re looking at very carefully, as well as very careful data within the United States of exactly where the virus is? What’s the attack rate? Has it moved out of its more confined geography? And really looking at each of those pieces of information. It’s a lot of data to go through and that-"
2020-03-23,01:12:09,Unnamed (Reporter),What do you think of Germany and Britain’s moves?
2020-03-23,01:12:12,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, I think if you remember just a week ago, Britain had a very different approach, so everybody is adapting to their data. I haven’t looked at the data that informed that decision, so I can’t really comment on how they got to that decision there or in Germany."
2020-03-23,01:12:27,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Birx, just to be clear, do you agree with the president’s push to reopen the country? He said some of his doctors that he’s talking to about this, he says, “I think they’re okay with it.” Are you okay with that?"
2020-03-23,01:12:38,Dr. Deborah Birx,"What the president has asked us to do is to assemble all the data and get us, give him our best medical recommendation based on all the data. That’s what he’s asked us to do and so that’s what we’ll be doing this week. We were going to have to do it this week anyway-"
2020-03-23,01:12:53,Donald Trump,"Yup, you’re doing it."
2020-03-23,01:12:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Because we had to make a decision come Monday about the 15 days to reduce social spread. This is consistent with our mandate to really use every piece of information that we can in order to give the president our opinion that’s backed up by data, not our perception, but our opinion that’s backed up by data."
2020-03-23,01:13:16,Unnamed (Reporter),"And now, you think you could in a week, like what would your assessment be of right now looking forward?"
2020-03-23,01:13:20,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, we’re pulling all of the data pieces in now and that’s really critical. I don’t like to, I will never speculate on data. I will have to see the data in order to really understand it."
2020-03-23,01:13:32,Donald Trump,"And I think the big factor is the mortality rate, we’re talking about about the mortality rate. When we first started, people were thinking about three and 4% and now we’re talking about a much lower number than that. I think it’s a-"
2020-03-23,01:13:44,Unnamed (Reporter),What is the number?
2020-03-23,01:13:44,Donald Trump,I think it’s a number that will be a lot different than people thought.
2020-03-23,01:13:49,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The mortality rate is driven almost exclusively as we have talked about by people with pre-existing conditions and older. That has become from the very beginning, that was our emphasis. When we started two or three weeks ago talking with one another, our focus has been on how do we protect those with pre-existing conditions and the elderly? And I think these steps were about protecting with pre-existing conditions. The whole key to changing the mortality rates is not just the hospital care, but preventing them from going into the hospital to begin with because you don’t need, want them to be infected."
2020-03-23,01:14:28,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:18:29]. It’s much lower than we originally thought. I mean, frankly-"
2020-03-23,01:14:34,Dr. Deborah Birx,Yes.
2020-03-23,01:14:34,Donald Trump,It’s a lot lower.
2020-03-23,01:14:35,Unnamed (Reporter),Do you have an estimate? Do you have a number?
2020-03-23,01:14:37,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, you know what the estimate in Wuhan was originally, it was over 3%. When they look outside of Wuhan, it was about 0.7%. It depends very much. In South Korea, it was about 0.7-0.8%. But I don’t want, that’s like a tyranny of averages and I, you know, that’s not having, that’s probably missing 50-60% of the data because no one was testing asymptomatics. Remember?"
2020-03-23,01:15:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"In every country you had to be symptomatic to get a test. We’re making case fatality rates when we’re missing a significant part of the data. If anything, it will go lower. But I don’t want people, I don’t… That should not be reassuring because the death rates escalate with age and pre-existing conditions."
2020-03-23,01:15:28,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I really want to be clear that although it may be very low, if you’re under 40, or very low if you’re under 50, and very low if you’re under 70. There is an inflection curve, there are people, the average age of the person who’s dying in Italy is in the mid-eighties, so there is really a significant issue in our older generation that we feel strongly about protecting."
2020-03-23,01:15:50,Donald Trump,"Doctor, it’s just very interesting. The whole thing. It’s an incredible subject. When somebody is very sick, they go to a doctor, go to a hospital, they’re recorded, they’re very sick, and then they live or they don’t live, see what happens. But when somebody isn’t very sick at all, I’ve heard people that they don’t even know they had it and they’re healing. Then I’ve heard people that have like a cold or they have a running nose or even people that stay home and they think they have the flu, or in some cases they think they have a really bad case of the flu."
2020-03-23,01:16:19,Donald Trump,"But all of those people, that vast majority of, I mean beyond vast majority of people, they’re not reporting. They’re not calling the doctor, they’re not calling them."
2020-03-23,01:16:28,Dr. Deborah Birx,Right.
2020-03-23,01:16:28,Donald Trump,"They’re just getting better. You would think it would have to be because the people that are sick are going to a doctor or they’re going someplace, and they’re going to say, “Make me better.” The people that are just short of that and people that aren’t even, I mean, we have many people where they literally don’t even know that they have it. Now, you’re building up the number of cases that we talked about before and yet, so you don’t know any what, you don’t know how many they are. [crosstalk 01:16:55]. It could be a vast number. But what you do know is all the people that are really sick."
2020-03-23,01:16:59,Donald Trump,Because all of the people that are really sick are going to a doctor in some form. And the doctor is reporting it in all cases itself.
2020-03-23,01:17:06,Dr. Deborah Birx,But that’s why your question about the antibody test is so critical because that will give us really a much better baseline to really understand.
2020-03-23,01:17:13,John (Reporter),"So Mr. President, when you talk about how it could be a much, much bigger problem, you said that at several stages on whether or not we keep these guidelines in place. You talked about higher death, are you talking about suicide? Like help us understand [crosstalk 01:17:25]."
2020-03-23,01:17:24,Donald Trump,I’m talking about many forms.
2020-03-23,01:17:27,John (Reporter),Is the risk here a depression? Is that what you’re getting at?
2020-03-23,01:17:29,Donald Trump,"We’re talking about… Look, number one, it’s the country itself. You’re talking tremendous disruption economically, but you’re talking about massive depression, massive numbers of suicide-"
2020-03-23,01:17:41,John (Reporter),You mean economic depression?
2020-03-23,01:17:42,Donald Trump,"No, I’m talking about, no, I’m not talking about economic. Although, you could be talking about that, too."
2020-03-23,01:17:47,John (Reporter),You could be talking about economic depression.
2020-03-23,01:17:48,Donald Trump,"What I’m talking about is people suffering massive depression because they had a fantastic job and now they have no idea what’s going on. Now, here’s the good news. If they get the bill passed, we’re taking care of those people. We’re going to really take good care of those people beyond what any country has done for people. But there’s never been anything like this."
2020-03-23,01:18:08,Donald Trump,"No. I’m talking about where people suffer massive depression,, where people commit suicide, where tremendous death happens. Now in addition to that, we’re talking about economic where you really hurt a country. It could take years and years to recover. And the longer you stay out, the harder it is to recover. I happen to think that you’re going to have, they call it the V, I think you’re going to have a very big bounce, you know, a very big bounce back. I think it’s going to be very big. We’ll see."
2020-03-23,01:18:36,John (Reporter),If you get the bill passed.
2020-03-23,01:18:36,Donald Trump,"Well, I think the bill should pass. It’s should pass quickly."
2020-03-23,01:18:39,John (Reporter),And you’re confident?
2020-03-23,01:18:40,Donald Trump,"Take care of our workers, take care of the companies that pay those workers, help those companies over this rough patch. But the longer it takes, the harder it is to come back. I’d like to be able to bounce back to where we were. And ultimately I think we’re going to be even further than that. But I’m just saying that the… What’s happening when I say the cure and the cure could be worse than the problem itself. Right? That’s what I, we can’t let that happen. We can’t let that happen."
2020-03-23,01:19:09,Donald Trump,"We’ve learned so much and so many good things are going to happen for our country. We can’t let this continue to go on. What we’re doing is we’re meeting with the doctors, Dr.Fauci, Dr. Birx and others and we’re, we’ve already started the discussion. And I can say that I’m a student like you’re students. We’re all learning this together. I learned a lot from Deborah. I learned a lot from Tony."
2020-03-23,01:19:35,Donald Trump,"I learned a lot from a lot of people that this is, this has been their life’s work. I’ve learned a lot. We’re going to come up with a date and we’re going to do two things. We can do two things at one time. At the same time, we’re going to be very vigilant. We’re going to be so vigilant in terms of all of the things that we have to do that we’ve been talking about for the last two weeks ad nauseum. And I think it’s going to be ultimately a far better solution for our country. Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-03-23,01:20:07,Unnamed (Reporter),What advice Dr. Fauci-
2020-03-23,01:20:08,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:20:08] want her to go back and you want her to go back to work. Immediately. Thank you. Great job. Thank you, Deborah."
2020-03-23,01:20:13,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Birx, can I have one more question?"
2020-03-23,01:20:14,Donald Trump,"Yeah, Deborah?"
2020-03-23,01:20:16,Male Speaker,One more.
2020-03-23,01:20:18,Donald Trump,They won’t let you go.
2020-03-23,01:20:18,Unnamed (Reporter),Thank you. There’s still one week left to go and 15 days to slow the spread. Doesn’t talk of reopening the government quickly undermine that? I mean why would anyone today still social distance or not run out to see the Cherry Blossoms?
2020-03-23,01:20:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Actually, it should reinforce it because if people know that we’re considering and trying to understand the impact of the good work that they have done, I think it reinforces them to do good work for the next whatever it is days, weeks in the future. Because it says to them, we’re looking very carefully of the impact that the work that you did, the selflessness that you brought to this, the ability to stay home with your fabulous children, your ability to social distance, the ability to give up on going to restaurants and just having takeout."
2020-03-23,01:21:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"All of those sacrifices, the ability of your protecting our elder generation, the greatest generation and making sure they’re safe in nursing homes, but not seeing them. All of us have made sacrifices. I haven’t seen my grandchildren in three weeks. I know other people are like that, that they have really made those personal sacrifices. What we’re asking every American to do is to make those personal sacrifices for these next week and now so that we can evaluate the impact of that sacrifice. I think if anything, it strengthens the willpower to say, “Yes, I can do this.”"
2020-03-23,01:21:47,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-03-23,01:21:48,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, [crosstalk 01:21:49] what are your thoughts on Fauci today?"
2020-03-23,01:21:53,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, one second, please."
2020-03-23,01:21:54,Unnamed (Reporter),"Sir, one thing some public health officials have said would be helpful is to open back up the ACA exchanges so that people who are worried about perhaps getting treatment could go sign up for insurance now, even though the open enrollment period is open, that’s something you can do with [crosstalk 00:26:12]."
2020-03-23,01:22:11,Donald Trump,"Well, it is. It’s something we’re talking to a lot of people about. We’ll see what happens, but we’re talking to people about it. Go ahead, please."
2020-03-23,01:22:17,Unnamed (Reporter),Where is Dr. Fauci right now? Why is he not at this briefing? Will he attend future ones? And-
2020-03-23,01:22:21,Donald Trump,"Let me just, I was just with him for a long time. And-"
2020-03-23,01:22:24,Mike Pence,He’s at the task force.
2020-03-23,01:22:24,Donald Trump,"Oh, he’s at the task force meeting right now."
2020-03-23,01:22:24,Mike Pence,He’s at the task force.
2020-03-23,01:22:28,Donald Trump,We have a task force meeting. He was there.
2020-03-23,01:22:32,Unnamed (Reporter),Does he agree with you about the need to reopen the the economy soon?
2020-03-23,01:22:35,Donald Trump,"Well, he doesn’t not agree. I mean, we had a long talk and he understands this tremendous, there’s a tremendous cost to our country, both in terms of lives and in terms of economics and in terms of many, many years of rebuilding something that was a fine tuned machine. It was nobody’s fault. It just happened. This horrible virus came from wherever and it just happened. It just happened. He fully understands that now. He’s a good man. I like Dr. Fauci a lot, just so you understand."
2020-03-23,01:23:04,Donald Trump,"No, he’s not here because we really weren’t discussing what he’s best at, but he’ll be back up very soon. Yeah, please. And we’ll be discussing dates and times with him. And we are talking about a… I don’t want to use the word abbreviated because so much has been gained by what we’ve done. But we’re talking about not during the period, you know, during the 14 or 15 days, but not too long after that-"
2020-03-23,01:23:33,Unnamed (Reporter),Mr. President-
2020-03-23,01:23:33,Donald Trump,"Which, I think is going to make a lot of people happy. It’s going to make a lot of companies happy. It’s going to make a lot of workers happy. Yeah, John?"
2020-03-23,01:23:39,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, so ultimately, will you take Dr. Fauci’s recommendation on this or are you thinking he’s just looking at one set of inputs?"
2020-03-23,01:23:46,Donald Trump,"I would certainly, he’s very important to me and I would, I will be listening to him. I’ll be listening to Deborah, who you just spoke to. I’ll be listening to other experts. We have a lot of people that are very good at this, and ultimately, it’s a balancing act, but-"
2020-03-23,01:24:03,Donald Trump,"Ultimately, it’s a balancing act, but the expression, we can do two things at one time and we’ve got an incredible country. We have to keep it that way and that includes not just economics, that also includes life and death. We have to keep it that way."
2020-03-23,01:24:19,Unnamed,"Mr. president you’re talking about social distancing amongst us reporters and you mentioned that one of our own has come down or potentially come down. Even if someone does come down in the white house, press court. Would you pledge to the American people that you’ll keep this room open? We’re clearly six feet apart."
2020-03-23,01:24:37,Donald Trump,"Well, I’ve gotten to like this room. This room is very convenient. I can say from the standpoint of being president of the United States I really… This has been a very convenient room for all of us. You people are set up, so I never even thought of closing it. So you’re asking me a question that I never thought in terms of closing it. Can you give me a good reason to close it? We could build a larger one."
2020-03-23,01:24:58,Unnamed,Opportunity to… I mean you see [crosstalk 01:25:00]-
2020-03-23,01:25:01,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to make commitments like that because it’s not something I’ve ever really thought about. There are certain people that would like to see a larger room built. We need a larger room. Other presidents didn’t need such a large room, but we need a larger room and there are some people, but it’s not something that is really on my mind to be honest with you. Yes, please."
2020-03-23,01:25:19,Unnamed (Reporter),"All right. So quarter two, we know it’s going to be brutal. Who are you listening to? Where is the brain trust to help get us through that period? Also, has your opinion of the chair [crosstalk 01:25:29]-"
2020-03-23,01:25:29,Donald Trump,Which period?
2020-03-23,01:25:29,Unnamed (Reporter),"Quarter two, the second quarter. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, they’re all predicting a pretty dire second quarter. Who are you listening to? Where’s the brain trust? You have all these medical advisors."
2020-03-23,01:25:40,Donald Trump,"I think we’re listening to many people. I mean that was my world. I know many of those people. I have many people that are friends of mine, some enemies also by the way. But it’s been a good world for me. I like that world. I like those people. They’re tough and they’re smart. But I listened to many of them. Ultimately, they all go into that computer and I say, this is what we’re going to do. I have to make a decision. This is a very important man right here to my right, our great vice president, because he’s got a great instinct about things too. So I’m going to be listening to my case, headed up the task force I think brilliantly. I think it’s going to go down as that because he’s really done a job. Not only has he been good, he’s been soothing. He’s really been great for the American public to watch it."
2020-03-23,01:26:26,Donald Trump,"I mean that in the most positive way. There’s a solidity with Mike that you don’t find in many people. He’s been soothing. He’s been good for the American public. They have confidence in him. I think he’s done an incredible job and his advice is very, very important to me. So he’s going to be making… I mean, he didn’t come from that world, the world of finance, but he understands the world of finance. He was a great governor in Indiana. They did very well financially too."
2020-03-23,01:26:55,Unnamed (Reporter),So you won’t give us one name of someone else you’re listening to?
2020-03-23,01:26:55,Donald Trump,I can give you a whole list and we’ll probably even set up committees. I’d rather give you one because then I’m going to leave out… I have spoken to so many people and-
2020-03-23,01:27:03,Unnamed (Reporter),[crosstalk 01:27:03] spigot today-
2020-03-23,01:27:04,Donald Trump,What?
2020-03-23,01:27:04,Unnamed (Reporter),So are you happy over the Fed now that he’s turned on the spigot?
2020-03-23,01:27:07,Donald Trump,"I am happy with him. Yes. I think he’s… I really think he’s a caught up and he’s done the right thing and I think ultimately we will be rewarded because of the decision he made over the last… He’s really stepped up over the last week and I have to tell you, I called him today and I said, Jerome, good job. You really did it [crosstalk 01:27:29]. It might be, he was just a little bit slower than I would have liked in the sense of what he was doing. Now, other people might have liked it, but today I called up Jerome Powell and I said, “Jerome, you’ve done a really good job.” I was proud of him. That took courage and ultimately you’re going to see the fruits. Now. He’s not finished. I mean, he’s got other arrows in the quiver or whatever they say, I will tell you he’s got plenty of arrows. But no, I’m very happy with the job he did."
2020-03-23,01:28:01,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. vice president, you said that you’d bring the secretary of education here either yesterday or today. Why isn’t she here today and can we expect for this week? Also, yesterday you said you have some guidance for us and people who had potentially been exposed to the virus returning to work sooner. You still expect their guidance."
2020-03-23,01:28:16,Mike Pence,"Yes. Thank you for the question. I spoke to the secretary of education today and we’re going to have her at the podium very soon. The department of education has created a very easy waiver application for every state. It’s virtually an automatic application for states that want to be excused from national standardized testing requirements. We reviewed that with all of the governors today and also what’s called distance learning, the accreditation process for higher education. The secretary of education at the president’s urging has loosened the rules around distance learning. You’re seeing many colleges and universities embracing distance learning now putting it into practice, we’ve allowed for that. But also the department of education is setting up a website and best practices information for K through 12 distance learning and she actually told me that the state of Florida and New Hampshire are really setting the pace on distance learning for K-12."
2020-03-23,01:29:24,Mike Pence,"My wife is an elementary school teacher. Obviously there’s different challenges for distance learning for K through 12 students, particularly younger kids. But the department of education is determined to continue to make those best practices available. We talked about the website that’s being built and she’ll be coming in and making a presentation on that because as the president reflected a little bit ago as, Dr. Burkes did. We understand there’s a lot of kids out of school, but parents are anxious. A lot of kids out of college and university. Like my daughter who’s has been dismissed from the what remains of this semester of grad school, bu it’s still doing the work and the department of education is working earnestly to make that a reality."
2020-03-23,01:30:15,Unnamed (Reporter),We’ll see her to see.
2020-03-23,01:30:16,Mike Pence,I’m sorry.
2020-03-23,01:30:16,Unnamed (Reporter),We’ll see her this week.
2020-03-23,01:30:16,Mike Pence,"Yes, I’ll have her here this week. I mean given the issues that we were dealing with today with the attorney general, we thought it might be just as timely in a few days. With regard to the guidance that you asked about the president’s coronavirus task force is in the process of reviewing recommendations from CDC. We’re working with the Department of Homeland Security. We’ll be bringing those to the president as recommendations of approval. We’re specifically looking at people that work in critical infrastructure, people in law enforcement, people in critical transportation."
2020-03-23,01:30:56,Mike Pence,"You can go right now to the department of Homeland security’s website for a very useful definition of critical infrastructure. If you look at the second page of 15 days to slow the spread, you’ll see the president’s recommendation for this 15 days is for people to stay home from work whenever possible except for people working in critical infrastructure. The guidance that we’re looking forward to unpacking is how people who may have come into contact with someone that test positive coronavirus would be able to, if they have no symptoms, would be able to return to work, wear a mask for a certain period of time, but otherwise go back to business. It’s a focus on critical infrastructure jobs. We should have that guidance before the president and before the public tomorrow."
2020-03-23,01:31:44,Unnamed,"Mr president, we have understandably a patchwork."
2020-03-23,01:31:46,Donald Trump,"No wait, I just want to say, we’re thinking about it. China has very much stepped up as you probably know, the agricultural purchases from our farmers and some other purchases too. So they have a difficult time also right now. But they’ve very much stepped up their purchases and significantly. So we’re very happy about that. The other thing, I’m standing here, this case with our vice president trying to let you ask anything you want having to do with the subject, which frankly is pretty much all anyone cares about right now. Because I think it’s very important. I don’t want to stand here for two hours and do this, but I think it’s important that I call it get it out of your system. Give us any question about it because I think it’s important for the public to know. So we don’t want to answer two questions and leave. We want to answer your questions."
2020-03-23,01:32:41,Donald Trump,"That’s why we’re doing this for so long. I think it gives our country confidence and it gives… I think we’re all gaining knowledge. This has been an unbelievable process, but we’re all getting… So I want to stay here. Sometimes we’re here for two hours and we’re answering questions. At least you will say that I’m very transparent. I think you’re going to have a hard time saying he is not transparent. But we take a lot of questions from you. Unfortunately, some of them are repetitive and some of them are fantastic questions. Some of these questions are great. Some of the questions lead to us solving a problem. You bring up problems that people didn’t know existed. But I just want to let you know so we’re doing this so that we can be transparent so that we can get everything out. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-03-23,01:33:29,Unnamed,"Mr president, we have a patchwork of plans, understandably at the moment. Are you coordinating an economic response with the leaders of the G7 at moment?"
2020-03-23,01:33:37,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-23,01:33:37,Unnamed,You are?
2020-03-23,01:33:38,Donald Trump,"We’re very, very close to them. We had a couple of great talks plus I’ve spoken to a number of them individually. Yeah, we’re very, very closely aligned. Please."
2020-03-23,01:33:48,Unnamed,"One for the vice president and one for you. Vice president Pence we’re talking about those self swab tests. When will this be available? They said this week, but do you know which day and do you know where they’re going?"
2020-03-23,01:33:59,Mike Pence,"The FDA just announced that decision and my understanding is that they’ll be now going directly to market. I’ll have a good estimate for you on timeline. But and what the president has charged us to do at the task force is to promote as much creativity and as much innovation as possible. Frankly, Dr. Hahn as the president said at the FDA has done a remarkable job going through the review and approval process for these new methodologies. Really in record time. We reflected a little bit ago about the fact that we’re pretty sure we set a record, I think it was 62 days to be in the phase one clinical trials of a vaccine that’s actually in clinical trials today."
2020-03-23,01:34:53,Mike Pence,"But this new approval from a study done by United Health Group and the Gates Group means that now self collected nasal swabs will become available. We’re going to be working through FEMA with governors around the country to make sure and distribute those, those methods as well as the swabs or any other supporting material and get those into this vast array of labs that are now stood up around the country."
2020-03-23,01:35:23,Donald Trump,"That’s going to make a big difference because that really is a process that’s easy as opposed to the current process, which is not, as I’ve said, it’s not pleasant."
2020-03-23,01:35:33,Unnamed,"I have a question for you. I just want to get clarity on this. If we get to next week you’re deciding what to do with these guidelines, whether to ease them or reinstate them for another 15 days. Will you follow the advice of Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci if they say you should maintain it for to more weeks?"
2020-03-23,01:35:47,Donald Trump,"Yeah. Then ultimately I have to make a decision, but I certainly listened to them. I listened to a number of people. I have a lot of respect for Dr. Fauci and for Dr. Birx and I’ll be listening to them and others that we have that are really doing good. John."
2020-03-23,01:36:01,John (Reporter),"Are you worried that if you do this too quickly, if you lift these restrictions too quickly, the virus will start spreading on unabated and how can you be sure that’s not going to happen?"
2020-03-23,01:36:11,Donald Trump,"We have now a system and the systems in place and we have two very, very powerful alternatives that we have to take into consideration. And as I said, one of the things that has really gotten me thinking about this, number one, I’m looking at what’s going on and you know it’s life is fragile and economies are fragile, but one of the things is the mortality rate, John. When we first started this, nobody knew anything about this particular virus. Very, very little. I mean we started, if we were hearing numbers of 5% that would, that’s an astronomical number when the flu is 0.001 and two and three, right? So 5% would be an astronomical number. Now we’re seeing numbers that may be less than one and that’s not including the exercise that I just went through where many people don’t report. So everybody getting very sick is reporting, but nobody getting not very sick."
2020-03-23,01:37:10,Donald Trump,"That should be part of that equation. So that just keeps reducing the number. So the mortality rate, that’s a big… To me that’s a very big factor. When we were hearing three and 4%, remember we had one day where we thought it was 5% and we’re getting a lot of bad numbers from countries that, I don’t know why, but we were getting a lot of bad numbers. I do wish, again, our relationship’s very good with China, but I wished they could have told us about this a little bit sooner. You know that. But the mortality rate is a big thing for me because I think we’re very substantially under 1% now. It’s still terrible. It’s still the whole thing. The whole concept of death is terrible, but there’s a tremendous difference between something under 1% and four or five or even 3%. So that’s something that we’re learning now. I think the number may be lower than people think because of what I’ve been saying. Yeah, please."
2020-03-23,01:38:04,Jeff (Reporter),Mr. President have you instructed secretary Manisha and the others working on this bill with Congress to meet some of the demands that Democrats have made with regard-
2020-03-23,01:38:13,Donald Trump,"Well, I thought we had a deal last night and then the Democrats changed the deal. So we had a deal last night that was going to be phenomenal for the workers, which is my number one aim. I want to take care of the workers and we had a deal. I was pretty sure we had a deal last night if you would told me at a certain time about 9:00 I would have told you we pretty much have a deal. And then all of a sudden it changed. It changed fairly rapidly. It was unaccepted. It would have been bad for our country and they were asking for things that would have not been good. I mean things that that bore no relationship to what we’re talking about and we said that’s not the game. We can’t play that game. So we’ll see. Look, the Democrats do want to make a deal. But Jeff, I thought we had a deal last night."
2020-03-23,01:38:58,Jeff (Reporter),further into this process for most of them now. And decide that further stimulus is needed. Will you be able to work with speaker Pelosi on that?
2020-03-23,01:39:07,Donald Trump,"I’ll work with anybody to help the American people. I will. I don’t care who it is. I’ll work with anybody. If I feel I’m going to help the American people and the American worker. Yeah, please."
2020-03-23,01:39:16,Unnamed,Mr. President some states are reporting a shortage of materials needed to actually process the tests. So what is the administration doing to get all the States materials that they need?
2020-03-23,01:39:28,Donald Trump,"Well, you just saw the Admiral and you just saw the FEMA people and you just saw the army corps of engineers. We’re building hospitals in New York and California and State of Washington and New Jersey. I just made a commitment to fill that we’re going to help him out with some of the areas in New Jersey, which is very important, a great state. So, we’re doing a great job and with it to help the governors, but the governors are on the front line and they can do some of it themselves. Governor Cuomo, he’s been working very hard and he worked with me on the hospitals and medical centers because it’s not just hospitals, it’s called hospital and another is medical centers of which we’re building numerous for New York. We have it all laid out. We have Javits center and then we have other locations throughout the state."
2020-03-23,01:40:22,Donald Trump,"I think it’s really a great plan and we’re going to have FEMA and the army corps of engineers involved. I’ve worked with them we’re building a wall. We’re up to over 150 miles of wall on our Southern border, which is now turning out to be even more important than we originally thought. But I always thought it was very important having borders. So, I’m working with the army corps of engineers and I see what they do and how they do it. That’s used to be my business. I know it very well and they’re very professional. They’re really good."
2020-03-23,01:40:53,Donald Trump,"So you’re going to see a lot of good things happening in many States beyond the States. I just mentioned in many States, we’re working with governor Ron DeSantis in Florida. We’re working with governor McMaster, right? In South Carolina where they have a little bit of a breakout, not by comparison but a little bit. We’re working with many, many governors and many, many states. Actually States where you almost would think that they have it under pretty good control and they’ve done a great job, but we’re working with many states and that’s primarily FEMA and the army corps of engineer. They’re capable of doing it."
2020-03-23,01:41:29,Unnamed (Reporter),"Back to the stimulus. Can I ask a question on behalf of my radio pool colleague Tamara Keith from NPR, she asked me to ask this to you. You just mentioned that there was some things last night that were unacceptable, which would have been bad for the country that the Democrats were bringing into the stimulus conversation. Her question was what provisions would you absolutely not support in this plant right now?"
2020-03-23,01:41:48,Donald Trump,"Well, a lot of the provisions that they wanted, like stock buy backs. I agree with it. That’s good with me. I mean, I don’t like them buying back stock. I like them spending money on airplanes and on their employees and they real business, not buying back stock. I don’t know if that provision is going to be put in one way or the other. But I’m all for it and many Republicans, I can tell you are for it and I think many Democrats are for it. But they were putting that out like it was a problem last night. Not a problem for me, I can tell you that, please."
2020-03-23,01:42:19,Unnamed (Reporter),"She also wants to know how much would you want the cash relief directly for Americans, what number would you like to [crosstalk 01:42:24]?"
2020-03-23,01:42:25,Donald Trump,"Well, I think when you’re talking about right now is at least $3,000 per family of four in that correct. $3,000 for a family of four, which is bold. If this continued, we have to build this up and if this continued we’ll do something else and we’ll do more at a later date. But that’s a big number. If you remember, they were talking about $500 and $600 and we are all for the three. As of this moment, it’s $3,000 for a family of four. Please go ahead."
2020-03-23,01:42:58,Unnamed,"When you’re looking at some of the economic headwinds that we’re facing, I’m wondering if one of the things you’re concerned about is the strength of the dollar and if there’s something that we should do to address that, including [crosstalk 00:19:08]?"
2020-03-23,01:43:07,Donald Trump,"Well, we have a very strong dollar and a strong dollar is good in many ways, but it’s also tough in many ways because it makes trade much harder. It makes it much harder for a Caterpillar tractor and other companies to sell their goods to Europe or China or wherever they may be sold. So having a strong dollar is good, but it really sounds good. But the truth is it makes certain things like trade much tougher. Our dollar, I don’t know if you’ve seen, but our dollars have been very strong, especially against other currencies, very, very strong. Which again, makes that trading more difficult. But there’s something nice about having a strong dollar, right? No matter what, I’m president, I used to have a strong dollar, but it does make trading more different."
2020-03-23,01:43:49,Unnamed,Just to go back to statements. You’re confident you’re going to get a deal.
2020-03-23,01:43:53,Donald Trump,"Well, I think the Democrats want a deal and I think we want to deal. So it would be very foolish if they didn’t make a deal. The American public is demanding it. I can tell you the Republicans want to make a deal and we want to make a deal that’s good for the workers, good for the country. I really believe the Democrats want to make a deal, but they have to stop asking for things that bear no relationship to what we’re talking about."
2020-03-23,01:44:15,Unnamed,You had a lot [crosstalk 01:44:16]-
2020-03-23,01:44:16,Donald Trump,That are actually bad. That are actually not good for the country.
2020-03-23,01:44:19,Unnamed,"You’ve been very laudatory, [inaudible 01:44:21] democratic governors. You mentioned governor Cuomo. You mentioned some others. If you’d get a stimulus bill, I’m wondering if you extend this bipartisan goodwill to speaker Pelosi and invite her here for a signing ceremony?"
2020-03-23,01:44:33,Donald Trump,"Well, let’s see what happens. I have to see what happens. Right now we don’t have a deal, but I think we’re very close. I mean, when I left, which was quite a while ago now, because again, we’re trying to answer every question so there’s no… Be nice if you were just exhausted and said, “That’s it. We can’t do any more.” But there’s always hands up. Maybe one of those questions is great and unique, but now look I want what’s good for the country and if that means meeting, I think that’s great. I just want what’s good for the country, great for our workers, great for the citizens of the United States. That’s all it [crosstalk 01:45:04]-"
2020-03-23,01:45:04,Unnamed,Have you spoken with Pelosi?
2020-03-23,01:45:07,Donald Trump,"It’s been a little. Yeah, please."
2020-03-23,01:45:08,Unnamed,"Both you and the vice president have been tested for the virus. Also, Mrs. Penn says the first lady been tested?"
2020-03-23,01:45:16,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-23,01:45:16,Unnamed,And?
2020-03-23,01:45:18,Donald Trump,She’s great. She’s fine.
2020-03-23,01:45:20,Unnamed,Negative?
2020-03-23,01:45:22,Donald Trump,Negative.
2020-03-23,01:45:27,Unnamed (Reporter),One of the sticking points on the stimulus. Who’s going to hold treasury accountable for this $500 billion corporate recipe fund?
2020-03-23,01:45:33,Donald Trump,"Well, we need that to help all of these companies that have a chance of not being companies anymore, and that’s going to be a good thing for the country because deals will be made and we’re talking to certain people. Some of the greatest people in the history of Wall Street, frankly. Where when they do a deal, we’ll have stock for America. We’ll take back stock for the United States. At the same time, most importantly, we’ll keep those companies healthy, but we can also make incredible deals for the country so that that number will increase exponentially. I mean, this is"
2020-03-23,01:46:11,Unnamed (Reporter),"[inaudible 01:46:11] with fun, it’s about the lack of oversight. The treasury has these unilateral authority to dual out all of this money."
2020-03-23,01:46:16,Donald Trump,"Oh look, I’ll be the oversight. I’ll be the oversight. We’re going to make good deals. We make good deals, but these companies need it. Even if it was just a simple loan, which would be. But we can do better than that and the companies are willing to do better than that. I mean, they got hit. Most of these companies, it was through no fault of their own. There are a couple where they were troubled before they came in. We talked about one, it had troubled, nobody can believe it actually in that one."
2020-03-23,01:46:42,Donald Trump,"But these companies are through no fault of their own. They have difficulty. I mean, two weeks ago, these companies were among the most solid institutions in the world. You’d want to buy their bonds, their bonds were rated AAA or whatever their highest rating is today. Now all of a sudden they have difficulty because they’ve been closed up. So you need something to keep them going, but that money is not going to be wasted money. That money’s going to be seen. We could multiply that number by many times coming back to the American public, that could be a phenomenal thing. But most importantly, it’s going to keep these great engines of jobs and ingenuity going. Very important. How about one or two more and we’ll go. Go ahead please [crosstalk 01:47:28]."
2020-03-23,01:47:28,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Are there things you regret in the way you handle the crisis so far? Are there words you regret?"
2020-03-23,01:47:34,Donald Trump,"I don’t think so. I’m looking forward. I don’t look back. I guess there’s always something everybody regrets. There things in your life you regret. We all regret things, but I really like to look forward. I’m a person that looks… Forward thinker. I guess they would say. No, I think that we’ve handled it really well. It seems to be the American public thinks that we’ve handled it well. If you look at polling data, but I’m not interested in myself. I’m interested in the American people. We have to get this going. We have millions and millions of jobs that were solid as a rock three weeks ago and today there could be questions."
2020-03-23,01:48:11,Donald Trump,"The faster we get it going, the more likely it is that those stores, little businesses, big businesses, medium sized businesses open up and we’ll get it going very fast. I really believe this is a pent up demand. I think that as soon as we say, “Let’s go.” It’s going to be pretty soon. It’s going to be pretty soon. It’s going to be sooner than people would think. Again, we’re in a position to take care of our country, but at the same time to have the country really, really go up like a rocket ship economically. That’s great for jobs. It’s great for everything else. Yeah, please."
2020-03-23,01:48:45,Jeff (Reporter),"Yeah. Mr. President, I’d like to ask a question for a colleague who can’t be in the room because of social distancing."
2020-03-23,01:48:50,Donald Trump,For who?
2020-03-23,01:48:51,Jeff (Reporter),"A colleague who can’t be in the room because of our social distance. About Florida, he wanted me to ask the governor DeSantis had closed all of the beaches in his state?"
2020-03-23,01:48:59,Donald Trump,"Well that’s really up to the governor. I mean I think first of all, he’s a great governor. He’s done an incredible job. Governor DeSantis of Florida and on the beaches, I guess he’s recently made a decision, but you do have a lot of room on the beaches. I think it’s just a decision that he made originally and then he’s refined it and then he’s done something that a lot of people agree with what he’s done, but he’s done a lot of things right. He’s been truly… I mean, he cares so much about health care, he cares so much about the cost of prescription drugs. He’s been a fantastic governor for Florida. They’re very happy with them."
2020-03-23,01:49:38,Donald Trump,"The whole concept of the beach, it’s a very interesting issue. There are a lot of open spaces that includes parks and other things, but rather than relying on social distancing, they’re probably going to do that one in a different way. But I would imagine when we make our decision, things like that would be opened up and then people will remember what they’re supposed to be doing. Well, I want to thank everybody very much and we’ll see you tomorrow sometime and we’ll get this going, I think really well. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it [inaudible 01:50:04]."
2020-03-24,00:10,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. I had a very busy day. I want to thank the American people for the incredible sacrifices that they’re making a behalf of our nation and I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on social distancing, avoiding large gatherings and hand-washing and all of the other things that everybody knows they’re supposed to be doing. Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy. We’re going for a while, but we’ll win."
2020-03-24,00:52,Donald Trump,"I said earlier today that I hope we can do this by Easter. I think that would be a great thing for our country and we’re all working very hard to make that a reality. We’ll be meeting with a lot of people to see if it can be done. Easter is a very special day for many reasons for me, for a lot of a lot of our friends. That’s a very special day and what a great timeline this would be. Easter as our timeline. What a great timeline that would be. My first priority is always the health and safety of the American people. I want everyone to understand that we are continuing to evaluate the data."
2020-03-24,01:37,Donald Trump,"We’re working with the task force and making decisions based on what is best for the interest of our fantastic country. In order to defeat the virus, we must continue to be very strong. Your resilience and spirit has been inspiring to everyone. Right now this virus is attacking 149 countries, but everybody looks to us and they’re watching us and I’m very proud to be your president, I can tell you that. There’s tremendous hope as we look forward and we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, stay focused and stay strong and my administration and myself will deliver for you as we have in the past."
2020-03-24,02:26,Donald Trump,"Let me provide you an update on critical preparations and supplies in a war on the virus. Through FEMA, the federal government is distributing more than 8,000,095 respirators, 14 million surgical masks and many, many millions more under order and there’ll be arriving soon. 2.4 million face shields, 1.9 million surgical gowns, 13.5 million gloves and more than 4,000 ventilators to the areas of greatest need have already been sent and we have 4,000 being delivered to New York. The federal government is using every resource at its disposal to acquire and distribute critical medical supplies."
2020-03-24,03:16,Donald Trump,"The core element of this strategy is my executive order authorizing the use of the Defense Production Act, which has, as you know, already been activated actually a long time ago, quite a long time ago. Private companies are heeding our call to produce medical equipment and supplies because they know that we will not hesitate to invoke the DPA in order to get them to do what they have to do. It’s called leverage. You don’t have to use it from the standpoint of actually it’s been activated but you don’t have to use it. But the threat of it being there is great leverage and companies are doing as we ask and companies are actually even better than that."
2020-03-24,03:56,Donald Trump,"They’re coming through and they’re calling us and it’s been really something to see. This morning, Ford, 3M, General Electric Healthcare are making tremendous numbers. They’ve already started respirators, ventilators and face shields. They’re working together. We didn’t have to exercise or utilize the DPA in any way. The fact that we have it helps but we didn’t have to and for the most part we won’t have to. We’re receiving full cooperation from companies with the understanding that the federal government stands ready to compel cooperation if need be."
2020-03-24,04:37,Donald Trump,"We haven’t found that to be the case and it’s been really amazing to see these big, strong, powerful, in some cases very small companies, family owned companies step up and make a lot of great product for what we’re going through and what we will continue to be going through for a while. The Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard are building four hospital facilities in New York City at the Javits Center, which will be operational very soon. They’ve already started. In addition, they’re building four separate medical facilities in different parts of the state."
2020-03-24,05:15,Donald Trump,"We’re dealing with Governor Cuomo on that. So you’re going to have four hospitals and four medical facilities at the highest level to really incredible facilities, temporary but incredible. We’re also deploying the US Navy Hospital Ship and that will be arriving in New York Harbor in the not too distant future. It’s finishing its maintenance. They’re doing a very big maintenance and what we did is we condensed it very seriously and as you know, the other hospital ship, and these are incredible ships. It’s already on its way to Los Angeles."
2020-03-24,05:53,Donald Trump,"So we’re in frequent contact with state and local officials and getting a lot of work done. We’re likewise building hospitals in Los Angeles. We are working also the state of Washington. We’re working with the governor of the state of New Jersey building a medical facility, a hospital facility, and doing a lot of work. I want to thank the people from FEMA, the great people from FEMA and also the Army Corps of Engineers. Secretary Mnuchin and the members of my administration continue to work closely with Congress. I’m pleased to report that we are working to pass the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history."
2020-03-24,06:36,Donald Trump,"Senators will soon hopefully vote on a $2 trillion bill that will deliver direct cash payments to struggling Americans, no fault of their own. This came out of nowhere. Nobody can imagine this even happened, but it’s not their fault. We want to protect and we will all of the things that a person needs protected and a family needs protected. We’re working on job retention loans for small businesses and extended unemployment insurance for laid off workers. The legislation will also include billions of dollars for additional resources for our and really heroic."
2020-03-24,07:18,Donald Trump,"These are incredible doctors, nurses, brave and hospitals as well as support for hard-hit industries such as the airline industry and the cruise ship industry, which employ tremendous amounts of people and obviously serve very important functions beyond that with very tough protections for the American taxpayer. The loans will be very secure and they will be very profitable and at the same time they’ll bridge, they call them bridge loans. In many cases, they’ll be bridging these companies back into very good health. Some of them are very important companies that four weeks ago didn’t have a problem."
2020-03-24,07:59,Donald Trump,"I’m also confident that the Democrats will do the right thing. I feel very confident. They’re working very hard together right now, Republicans and Democrats, and they’re getting very close to a very fair deal and a great deal for the people of our country. Today, as you probably saw, the Dow surged over 2,100 points. That’s the all time record history of the exchange. This is very encouraging and I think part of the reason is they are looking at what is close to being passed and I think a very big part of it is they see that we want to get our country open as soon as possible."
2020-03-24,08:35,Donald Trump,"They see we’re working very hard on that. That’s a very big factor, I think, in today’s a historic gain. The legislation developed in the Senate is the first step to restoring confidence and stability to America’s economy as we look ahead to the time when we can carefully and responsibly reopen country for business and we hope that’s going to be very soon. I want to ensure Americans that we have a team of public health experts. We’ve gotten to know them as well as I know them. They’re great people, incredible, talented. They love our country."
2020-03-24,09:09,Donald Trump,"Also, economists and other professionals working to develop a sophisticated plan to reopen the economy as soon as the time is right, one based on the best science, the best modeling and the best medical research there is anywhere on earth. Our great people have been, especially when it comes to our public health experts and officials, have been helping other countries, dealing with other countries, constant touch with other countries, helping them out because many of them have never seen anything like what’s happening."
2020-03-24,09:44,Donald Trump,"But our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening. I’m also hopeful to have Americans working again by that Easter, that beautiful Easter day. But rest assured, every decision we make is grounded solely in the health, safety, and wellbeing of our citizens. This is a medical crisis. This isn’t a financial crisis, but it’s a thing that nobody has seen for many, many decades. Nothing like this. Marshaling our economic strength is a key feature of defeating the virus, producing the material, supplies and equipment that we need, and they’re doing a really fantastic job."
2020-03-24,10:28,Donald Trump,"We’re helping the governors. We had a conference call the other day with the governors and we allowed the press to join us on the call, and the spirit between us and the governors has been really great. We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival. I think we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot. This crisis is underscore just how critical it is to have strong borders and a robust manufacturing sector. For three years, we’ve embarked on a great national project to secure our."
2020-03-24,11:02,Donald Trump,"Embarked on a great national project to secure our immigration system and bring back our manufacturing jobs. We brought back many jobs, record number of jobs, and this really shows, this experience shows how important borders are. Without borders, you don’t have a nation. Our goal for the future must be to have American medicine for American patients, American supplies, for American hospitals and American equipment for our great American heroes. Now both parties must unite to ensure the United States is truly an independent nation in every sense of the word."
2020-03-24,11:45,Donald Trump,"Energy independence, we’ve established that. That’s something incredible that we’ve established. We’re energy independent. Manufacturing independence, economic independence, and territorial independence enforced by strong sovereign borders. America will never be a supplicant nation. We will be a proud, prosperous, independent and self reliant nation. We will embrace commerce with all, but we will be dependent on none."
2020-03-24,12:19,Donald Trump,"Above all, we know that the best thing for our economy and the world right now is a very, very powerful victory over the virus. Every day the American people are showing the unity and resolve that has always defined the character of our nation. In New York, citizens are using 3D printers to make hundreds of face shields. They’re making them by the hundreds. In Texas, businesses and churches are uniting to collect gloves and thermometers for hospitals. In the selfless actions of our amazing citizens, we’re seeing enduring strength of our magnificent nation, a spirit that can never be broken and a victorious future that can never be denied. It never will be denied."
2020-03-24,13:08,Donald Trump,"Now what I’d like to do is perhaps ask a person who has really established herself as maybe the world’s great expert on what she does, if I could ask Deborah to come forward and say a few words and then I’ll ask Tony to come up and speak and then our vice president, and then we’ll take a few questions and we’ll do it quickly and we’ll probably see you again tomorrow. So Deborah, please."
2020-03-24,13:41,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I think those of you who heard the town hall, we are continuing to accelerate testing at a record rate. We now have 370,000 tests that have been done. The majority of those, over 220,000 in the last eight days, which those of you who have been tracking the South Korea numbers, put us equivalent to what they did in eight weeks that we did an eight days. This was made possible because of the HHS team working together, bringing together the strength of the FDA with the CDC and under the leadership of secretary ASR. We’re very proud of those numbers but we know that we have to do more and we continue to accelerate in testing to ensure that those who need the test are tested first and have access."
2020-03-24,14:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"As we talked about yesterday, we’re working on the ability for people to take their own sample. That does not mean home testing, that means taking your own sample in the front of your nose with available swabs into normal saline that can be transported to the laboratories. That will allow and free up all of the drive throughs to be very sparing on PPE, because you’ll be able to do that with gloves rather than the full PPE outfits. This will allow for more of that PPE to be dedicated to our hospitals."
2020-03-24,15:01,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think those of you who are tracking this epidemic closely like I am, you will begin to see that there is encouraging results coming out of Italy. We are impressed by the decreases that are seen in mortality, the number of people succumbing to this illness, and the number of new cases. Our new cases will continue to surge because we’re still working on our backlog, although we will be in touch with the laboratories after this press conference to really find out how many are still in backlog and how many were run in the last 24 hours. Until we can get into a 24 hour cycle, we’re going to have disproportional number of new cases compared to the actual new cases, and we will let you know when we’ve reached that equilibrium."
2020-03-24,15:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, and I know Dr. Fauci Will talk about this further, we remain deeply concerned about New York City and the New York Metro area. About 56% of all the cases in the United States are coming out of that Metro area and 60% of all the new cases are coming out of the Metro New York area, and 31% of the people succumbing to this disease. It means, because they still are at the 31% mortality compared to the other regions of the country, that we can have a huge impact if we unite together."
2020-03-24,16:18,Dr. Deborah Birx,"This means, as in all places, they have to be following the presidential guidelines that were put out eight or nine days ago, and this will be critical. But to everyone who has left New York over the last few days, because of the rate of the number of cases you may have been exposed before you left New York. And I think like Governor DeSantis has put out today, everybody who was in New York should be self quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread to others, no matter where they have gone, whether it’s Florida, North Carolina or out too far, far reaches of long Island."
2020-03-24,16:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We are starting to see new cases across new one across Long Island that suggest people have left the city, so this will be very critical that those individuals do self quarantine in their homes over these next 14 days to make sure they don’t pass the virus to others based on the time that they left New York. So if they’ve already are four days out, then it’s just 10 more days. So I thank you if you help get that message out to others. Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-24,17:29,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much Mr. President, Deb. I want to just talk very briefly about two or three things. First, the issue of testing and how that has really changed the complexion of the approach that we’re going to be able to take. We right now, testing was an issue. We had many questions of testing in this room for a number of times. Now that we literally have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of testing out there, there are a few things that we can do with that."
2020-03-24,17:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"One of the things is that when we make policy about what we’re going to be doing with the rest of the country, particularly those areas that are not hotspots, we need to know what the penetrance of infection is there, so we need to put a light on those dark spots that we don’t know. We have to act policy-wise on data and we’re going to be getting more data, a lot more data."
2020-03-24,18:16,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The other thing is that the areas of the country that are not hotspots, that are not going through the terrible ordeal that New York and California and Washington state are going through, they still have a window of significant degree of being able to contain. In other words, when you test, you find somebody, you isolate them, you get them out of circulation, and you do the contact tracing. When you have a big outbreak, it’s tough to do anything but mitigation. We have an opportunity now that we have the availability of testing to do that, so you’re going to be hearing more about how we can inform where we’re going, particularly because we have the ability to test."
2020-03-24,18:53,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The second thing is, I just want to reiterate what Dr. Birx said about New York. It’s a very serious situation. They’ve suffered terribly through no fault of their own, but what we’re seeing now is that understandably, people want to get out of New York. They’re going to Florida, they’re going to Long Island, they’re going to different places. The idea, if you look at the statistics, it’s disturbing about one per thousand of these individuals are infected. That’s about 8 to 10 times more than in other areas, which means when they go to another place for their own safety, they’ve got to be careful, monitor themselves, if they get sick, bring it to the attention of a physician, get tested. Also, the idea about self isolating for two weeks will be very important because we don’t want that to be another seating point to the rest of the country wherever they go."
2020-03-24,19:45,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And then thoroughly just one, one just comment about drugs and the testing of drugs. You know, you heard yesterday about drugs being out there that physicians on an off-label way can prescribe it to give people hope of something that hasn’t been definitively proven to work, but that might have some hope. I don’t want anybody to forget that simultaneously with our doing that, we’re also doing randomized clinical trials on a number of candidates. You’ve heard about candidates, but there are others in the pipeline where we’ll be able to design the study, and over a period of time, particularly since we have so many infections, we’ll be able to determine definitively, are these safe and are they effective? We’re talking about Remdesivir, other drugs, Immune Sera, Convalescent Serum, Monoclonal antibodies. All of these are in the pipeline now, queuing up to be able to go into clinical trial, so I’ll stop there and [inaudible 00:09:39]."
2020-03-24,20:39,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Tony. Good job. Larry, how about just a quick few minutes on how we’re doing over at the Hill, please?"
2020-03-24,20:46,Larry Kudlow,"Thank you sir. We’re gaining great progress on this phase three legislation, negotiations continue. We’ve had continued reports. I’ve been up there with Secretary Mnuchin. Secretary Mnuchin continues today with the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, checking in with the president. They’re getting closer and closer. They expect to vote as soon as possible. I just want to walk through a couple of key points."
2020-03-24,21:15,Larry Kudlow,"This legislation is urgently needed to bolster the economy, provide cash injections in liquidity and stabilize financial markets to get us through a difficult period, a difficult and challenging period in the economy facing us right now, but also to position us for what I think can be an economic rebound later this year. We started the year very strong, and then we got hit by the Coronavirus in ways that probably nobody imagined possible. We’re dealing with that as best we can. This package will be the single largest main street assistance program in the history of the United States. The single largest main street assistance program in the history of United States-"
2020-03-24,22:03,Larry Kudlow,"The largest main street assistance program in the history of the United States. Phase two delivered the sick leave for individuals, hourly workers, families, and so forth. Phase three, a significant package for small businesses. Loan guarantees will be included. We’re going to take out expenses and lost revenues. As the president said, eligibility requires worker retention. We will maintain the people eligible, we’ll maintain their payrolls during this crisis period. And on top of that, we will have direct deposit checks of roughly $3,000 for a family of four, and that will bridge to enhanced, plus step on unemployment insurance benefits that will essentially take those up to full wages. This is one, two, three, four."
2020-03-24,22:55,Larry Kudlow,"A strong workforce requires strong business. You can’t have a job without a business to work for. And the hope here is that the companies that were operating very well at the beginning of the year, when the economy was in good shape, we will help them and their employees get through this tough period so they will come out the other side, let’s say later this spring or summer, and will continue their operations. That’s the key point."
2020-03-24,23:20,Larry Kudlow,"Now don’t forget, there’s income tax deferrals for individuals and corporations without interest and penalties, there’s student loan interest and principal deferrals without any penalties. And finally, I want to mention the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Refund, that will be replenished. It’s important because that fund opens the door for Federal Reserve firepower to deal a broad based way throughout the economy, for distressed industries, for small businesses, for financial turbulence, you’ve already seen the Fed take action, they intend to take more action. And in order to get this, we have to replenish the Treasury’s emergency fund. It’s very, very important. Not everybody understands that. That fund, by the way, will be overseen by an oversight board and an inspector general. It will be completely transparent."
2020-03-24,24:16,Larry Kudlow,"So the total package here comes to roughly six trillion dollars, two trillion direct assistance, roughly four trillion in Federal Reserve lending power. Again, it will be the largest main street financial package in the history of the United States. Liquidity and cash for families, small business individuals, unemployed, to keep this thing going. We’re headed for a rough period, but it’s only going to be weeks, we think. Weeks and months. Not going to be years, that’s for sure. And hopefully pave the way for continued economic recovery after this crisis departs. Thank you sir."
2020-03-24,24:55,Donald Trump,"I’ve been hearing that voice for so many years, like 30 years or more maybe, and it’s a great voice and it’s a great man. So Larry Kudlow, thank you very much."
2020-03-24,25:04,Donald Trump,"I want to say that that package, and we went over parts of it, but pretty big parts. It really sets us up to, I think even supersede where we were a month ago. I think we can get up there quickly, and I think it allows us to supersede, it allows us to help these great companies that need help like Boeing, which had a problem and then on top of that problem it had the virus come in. But we’ll be helping Boeing, we’ll be helping the airlines, we’ll be helping the cruise lines. We’ll be doing a lot of things and the money will all come back to us and it’ll come back to us in a very strong form. And before we take some questions, I’d like to ask our great vice-president to say a few words if you wouldn’t mind, please."
2020-03-24,25:50,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President. The White House coronavirus task force met again today, and on behalf of the president of the United States, everyone on our team, and our state leaders, let me just say thank you America."
2020-03-24,26:03,Mike Pence,"People across this country, businesses large and small, are responding to the threat of the coronavirus in ways that are deeply inspiring. People are acting on the president’s 15 days to slow the spread, and it is making a material difference. Our experts standing beside us told us that if every American, regardless of whether you’re in an area that’s impacted by an outbreak of the coronavirus or not, if every American would embrace these guidelines, that we could significantly reduce the number of Americans that would contract the coronavirus, and protect the most vulnerable. And as the president reflected earlier, tens of millions of Americans are doing just that, and we’re grateful."
2020-03-24,26:49,Mike Pence,"The focus of our task force of course is to slow the spread, to promote mitigation strategies. Beyond that though, the president has us focused on testing and on supplies, and making sure that those that are enduring the symptoms of the coronavirus, and those who are ministering to them, our extraordinary healthcare workers, have the support that they need. In the category of supplies, you just heard Dr. Burks indicate that we’ve made great progress. We have done more tests in the last eight days than were done in the previous eight weeks, and it’s because of the public private partnership that the president forged with commercial labs. And I would encourage people around the country to remind your family members and friends that if you don’t have symptoms, don’t get a test. We want to make sure that people who are having symptoms, who have a concern, have the ability to be tested and to have those tests processed. We’re continuing to urge all county hospitals, all labs around the country, to report to the CDC all the results of the test, as it’ll give these experts around us the ability to continue to advise the president on best practices."
2020-03-24,28:05,Mike Pence,"As I mentioned, we all continue to follow the outbreak around the country and the test results, but as several have mentioned, we’re particularly focused on New York. The reality is the New York Metro area was 60% of the new cases in the country. And specifically as a lay person, I can tell you that the infection rates are roughly one in 1000 in the New York City metropolitan area, where they are 0.2% per thousand, or 0.1% per thousand in places like Washington state. It is the reason why today, the White House coronavirus task force is calling on any American, first and foremost if you’re in the New York City metropolitan area or elsewhere, to take the guidelines that we issued and avoid non-essential travel. But for anyone in the New York metropolitan area who has traveled, our task force is encouraging you to monitor your temperature, be sensitive to symptoms, and we are asking anyone who has traveled out of the New York City metropolitan area to anywhere else in the country to self isolate for 14 days. We have to deal with the New York City metropolitan area as a high risk area, and for that reason we’re taking these steps and asking for the cooperation of the American people."
2020-03-24,29:35,Mike Pence,"Because of the spread in New York City, we will continue to surge resources. The president’s described this, FEMA is coordinating with New York State for the arrival of the USS Comfort in just a matter of a few short weeks. Over the next 24 hours, more than 4,000 additional ventilators will be delivered to New York State as well. New York State has prioritized three alternative medical facilities, and at the president’s direction, the Army Corps of Engineers is working on plans to build those facilities out. You’ve heard the president speak about the Javid Center, the addition of a thousand beds, and we’ll continue. I want the people of New York City and the greater New York City area to know that we’re with you. We’re going to continue to provide resources to support your state and local officials as they confront the spread of the coronavirus in that great city."
2020-03-24,30:36,Mike Pence,"On the subject of supplies, we had team meetings today at FEMA, which is working on identifying the critical personal protective equipment and ventilators. At this point, FEMA informs us today that they are distributing 7.6 million N95 respirator masks, more than 14 million surgical masks, and FEMA has already shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York, 36 pallets of personal protective equipment to the state of Washington. We’ll be meeting again tonight. As you know, the president stood FEMA as a national response center up, and they are in the lead for the approach to the coronavirus which is locally executed, state managed, and federally supported. And we’ll continue to surge those resources and make sure that they’re available."
2020-03-24,31:28,Mike Pence,"One last word, if I may. The president reflected on the response businesses around the country have brought to this moment. It truly is extraordinary. And the president did initiate the Defense Production Act last week. But as the president has reflected many times, we will use the Defense Production Act if we need it to mandate production of critical supplies. But so far no one has said no, and in fact we see industry stepping up. President mentioned Ford Motor Company working with 3M and GE Health to expand production of medical supplies. We heard that McDonald’s is now offering curbside delivery to truckers who are unable to use the drive through to pick up a Big Mac. And I spoke today, and the president spoke last week with Tim Cook of Apple, and at this moment in time, Apple went to their store houses and is donating nine million N95 masks to healthcare facilities all across the country, and to the national stockpile. There is a level of generosity that I know is inspiring to the president, and it’s truly inspiring to all of us who are working on the White House coronavirus task force."
2020-03-24,32:40,Mike Pence,"The president’s made it clear that he hopes in weeks, not months, to be able to open up the country, but let me make one last encouragement to every American. We will get to that day quicker if every American will put into practice the president’s coronavirus guidelines for our nation, 15 days to slow the spread. If every American will do this, I have-"
2020-03-24,33:03,Mike Pence,"Is to slow the spread. If every American will do this, I have no doubt that we will slow the spread. We will protect our most vulnerable and we will heal our land. Thank you."
2020-03-24,33:14,Press,"Mr President, you just reiterated that you hope to have the country reopened by Easter. You said earlier you would like to see churches packed on that day. My question is, you have two doctors on stage with you. Have either of them told you that’s a realistic timeline?"
2020-03-24,33:26,Donald Trump,"I think we’re looking at a timeline, we’re discussing it. We had a very good meeting today. If you add it all up. That’s probably nine days plus another two and a half weeks. It’s a period of time that’s longer than the original two weeks, so we’re going to look at it. We’ll only do it if it’s good and maybe we do sections of the country. We do large sections of the country. That could be too but we’re very much in touch with Tony and with Deborah whenever they [crosstalk 00:33:54]."
2020-03-24,33:54,Press,Who suggested Easter? Who suggested that day?
2020-03-24,33:58,Donald Trump,"I Just thought it was a beautiful time, a beautiful timeline. It’s a great day."
2020-03-24,34:02,Press,So that wasn’t based on any of the data?
2020-03-24,34:02,Donald Trump,"It was based on a certain level of weeks from the time we started and it happened to arrive, actually we were thinking in terms of sooner. I’d love to see it come even sooner, but I just think it would be a beautiful timeline, John."
2020-03-24,34:16,John (Reporter),"Mr President, if you look at what we’ve just seen in the last day or so, you’ve seen the number of known coronavirus cases in the country double in just two days and another 95 people have died just in the last 24 hours. New York’s governor is saying this is running like a bullet train across the country and the governor of Louisiana is saying that his state, I may not be able to handle the cases that they’re facing by early April. So what are you seeing in all of this that leads you to think they we can reopen by Easter or even earlier?"
2020-03-24,34:51,Donald Trump,"We’re working with all of them. We can be talking about large sections of our country because there are sections of our country that you didn’t talk about that are doing unbelievably well. They’ve very little incidents or problem, there very small numbers. It’s very possible that they won’t be ever subject to what’s happening in New York. New York is definitely a hot spot. There’s no question about it and what we’re doing in New York to try and help and I think we’re doing an incredible job. We’re going to have the hospitals up quickly, the medical centers also quickly, but we’ll just have to see. We have to follow it. We have to see where to look at that curve. We’re going to see what it starts coming down and we’ll do the best job that can be done, John."
2020-03-24,35:32,Press John2,"Question for you Mr President and Dr. Fauchi if we could. When looking at this idea of an Easter timeline and I know that’s probably flexible. What are the metrics by which you will make the decision as to whether you can say, “Yes, we can open up this area of the country or no, we can’t open up that area”. Will you be looking at disease numbers? Will you be looking at possible containment, isolation?"
2020-03-24,35:54,Donald Trump,"I think we’ll be looking at a lot of things. We’ll also be looking again at very large portions of our country and I will be guided very much by Dr. Fauci and by Deborah and by some of the other professionals that work with both of you. And we’re going to see what will be. But that would certainly be, I think that’s a goal that perhaps can happen or at least for a very large portion of our country."
2020-03-24,36:19,Press,"Dr. Fauci, since the President said you and Dr.Burkes and others will be guiding him and making the decision. Where are you now with this timeline, 19 days from now?"
2020-03-24,36:28,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That’s really very flexible. We just had a conversation with the president in the oval office talking about, you can look at a date, but you got to be very flexible and a literally day by day and week by week basis. You need to evaluate the feasibility of what you’re trying to do. And John, you asked for what kind of metrics, what kind of data. When you look at the country, obviously no one is going to want to tone down things where you see what’s going on in a place like New York City. That’s just, you know, good public health practice and common sense, but the country is a big country and there are areas of the country and I refer to this in my opening remarks, that we really need to know more about what the penetrance is there."
2020-03-24,37:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So if we do the kind of testing that we’re doing and testing will always be associated by identification, isolation, and contact tracing. And you find after a period of time that there are areas that are very different from other areas of the country. You may not want to essentially treat it as just one force for the entire country, but look at flexibility in different areas."
2020-03-24,37:35,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So I think people might get the misinterpretation. You just going to lift everything up and even somebody’s going like that, that’s not going to happen. It’s going to be looking at the data and what we don’t have right now that we really do need is we need to know what’s going on in those areas of the country where there isn’t an obvious outbreak. Is there something underneath the surface that says, wait a minute, you better be careful and really clamp down or what looks there that you don’t really have to be as harsh as you are in other areas. So it’s looking at information that up to this point, John, we never had, so it’s a flexible situation."
2020-03-24,38:10,Press,So is New York becoming on [inaudible 00:38:12] is the North becoming F percent?
2020-03-24,38:14,Donald Trump,"Well certainly is by far if you call it hot, if you call it any word you want to use. It is at a level that I was speaking to Tony before. It’s a level that no place else is close. It’s very unfortunate. One of the things that’s happened that we’ve done, I think a really good job on it. I think that it’s something special what’s happened, is I learned from Dr. Burkes a little while ago when she said, I learned it actually this afternoon. In eight days because we kept hearing about South Korea. They had a very tough time at the beginning if you remember. In eight days we’re doing more testing than they’ve done in eight weeks. That’s a tremendous turn and with our testing it’s going exponentially it’s going up, up, up every day. So we’re going to be able to do things with his very highly sophisticated testing and it’s also the test itself is considered the best test. So on top of doing now more than anybody else, we have a very high quality test. That makes a big difference."
2020-03-24,39:17,Donald Trump,"It also makes a big difference even in terms of opening because we’re going to see those areas like the hotspots, but New York City definitely is a very hot spot, Steve."
2020-03-24,39:24,Steve (Reporter),"When you talk about areas that you could open up, what specifically are you looking at? What states are you talking about? Out West or mid West or South?"
2020-03-24,39:31,Donald Trump,"Well you can talk about the farm belt and take a look at the farm belt. Take a look at the areas out West. Look at big sections of Texas. I was talking to the great governor of Texas. They’ve done a fantastic job out there, but they have very big sections of Texas where it’s… That’s numerous States frankly. But we can have large sections if we want to do it that way, we could have large sections of the country open. I think it’s very important that we start moving on that and start thinking about it because our country wants to be open."
2020-03-24,40:04,Donald Trump,"Our people want it to be open and they’re raring to go and I think it’s one of the reasons that we’re going to have a tremendous bounce back. I think it’s going to go very quickly. Also, I want to thank while I’m here. I want to thank Larry for the job he’s done. Steven Mnuchin for the job he’s done. If you look at Peter Navarro, he’s doing different things. He’s really a force in terms of getting masks and getting all of the ventilators and all the things. He’s been fantastic, Peter. But I also want to thank Congress because whether or not we’re happy that they haven’t quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I’m talking Republicans and Democrats, all of them, the House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there and I think they will and I’ll see you all tomorrow. Thank you very much."
2020-03-24,40:59,Press,Did you give Governor Cuomo a heads up about quarantine [crosstalk 00:08:02]?
2020-03-24,41:06,Donald Trump,We’re talking to them about it yeah.
2020-03-24,41:08,Press,"[crosstalk 00:41:08] Is it wise to pack churches on Easter? Takes one person to contaminate a whole County. Hey Larry. Yeah. You want us, we could go informal. Yep. Meet you out front. Yep. That sounds good. (silence)."
2020-03-25,00:00,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. So, nice to be with you. America continues to gain ground in the war against the virus. I want to thank the American people for answering the call, following our guidelines and making the sacrifices required to overcome this terrible threat more aggressively. We commit to social distancing. So important social distancing, such an important phrase, and we do it right now the more lives we can save and the sooner we can eventually get people back to work, back to school, and back to normal. And there are large sections of our country probably can go back much sooner than other sections and we’re obviously looking at that also. People are asking, “Is that an alternative? And I say, “Absolutely. It is an alternative.”"
2020-03-25,01:11,Donald Trump,"I have now approved major disaster declarations for New York, California, Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. That has great significance as you know, and legal significance. We’re in a constant grouping and I can say this we have a large grouping of people that does nothing but communicate with the various officials including, we’ve been spending a lot of time with New York officials because that really is by far the hottest spot. They’ve got a number of very tough weeks ahead of them. The governor is doing a very good job. I spoke to the governor, Governor Cuomo, last night and this morning and he mentioned that in his remarks that he’s using, that we are using and I think he feels, cause he understands negotiation, he thinks we’re using very appropriately the Defense Production Act and we are. We’re using it where needed. It’s a great point of leverage. It’s a great negotiating tool. But I’ve really, I will tell you there’s tremendous spirit from people and tremendous spirit with respect to these companies and I don’t have to use it very much at all. They want to do it. As you know, General Motors is involved, Ford’s involved, 3M’s involved, others are involved and they’re all working very hard to produce product, different, all different products. We had very little product when we came. We built it up and we give it away as fast as we can to the different states."
2020-03-25,02:59,Donald Trump,"We’re also, as you know, building numerous hospitals and medical centers throughout certain areas. In New York it’s at the convention center, the Javits Convention Center. We’re doing four hospitals and we’re doing throughout the state four medical centers there, somewhat different. I want you to know that I’m doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge. I’m working very hard on New York. It’s really by far our biggest problem. Maybe it will be, maybe it won’t be, but there’s a lot of good capable people working on it with us and our teams are working very well with the state representatives. We’re also doing some very large testings throughout the country. I told you yesterday that in South Korea, and this is not a knock in any way because I just spoke with President Moon, we had a very good conversation about numerous other things, but they’ve done a very good job in testing but we now are doing more testing than anybody by far. We do more in eight days than they do in eight weeks and we go up on a daily basis exponentially, so it’s really good."
2020-03-25,04:12,Donald Trump,"By the way, while I’m on it, I also spoke with Prime Minister Abe of Japan last night and I congratulated him on a wise choice. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics, 2021. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics. It was the absolute right decision to delay it for a full year and now have a full beautiful Olympics. It’s going to be very important because it’s probably the first time, maybe ever or certainly in a long time that it was on a odd year. It’s always on an even year they tell me. But he’s going to have a fantastic success and now they’ll have even more time. He didn’t need any more time. Everything was perfectly ready. What a job they’ve done. But Japan, I want to congratulate Japan, the IOC, and Prime Minister Abe on a great decision. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics. I told him I’ll be there, I’ll be there."
2020-03-25,05:04,Donald Trump,"As we fight to protect American lives, we’re also protecting American livelihoods. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are very close to passing an emergency relief bill for American workers, families, and businesses. This legislation in addition to the two bills I signed this month that includes, as you know, sick leave and we have all sorts of things in for the workers, for families, but we have a tremendous paid sick leave provision for workers at no cost at all to the employers. And that’s a big thing, no cost to the employers. We want to get everybody back working. Together, this $2.2 trillion legislative package is bigger than anything I believe ever passed in Congress. Perhaps, relatively speaking, if you go back look during the FDR New Deal days there was something that if you time value it you could say it was bigger. I don’t know, but this is certainly in terms of dollars by far and away the biggest ever, ever done, and that’s a tremendous thing because a lot of this money goes to jobs, jobs, jobs and families, families, families."
2020-03-25,06:28,Donald Trump,"The Senate bill, as you know, includes $350 billion in job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers. They continue paying their workers. That’s what we want. We want them to keep their workers and pay their workers. This will help businesses keep workers in the payroll and allow our economy to quickly accelerate as soon as we defeat the virus. $300 billion in direct cash payments will be available for every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year. That would be $3,400 very quickly for the typical family of four. Nothing like that’s ever been done in our country. Up to $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. The average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months. Unlike normal unemployment benefits, independent contractors and the self-employed will be eligible, so you have independent contractors and self-employed people will be eligible for this."
2020-03-25,07:41,Donald Trump,"Over $100 billion to support the heroic work of our doctors, nurses and hospitals. They have been incredible. $45 billion for Disaster Relief Fund. We are setting up a fund, a $45 billion for disaster relief. That’s more than doubling the amount available to support my national emergency and disaster declarations. It’s a doubling up. $27 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile with critical supplies including masks, respirators, pharmaceuticals, and everything you can imagine because it was very depleted like our military was depleted. Now we have a brand new military. Never had a military like this. We have equipment either coming or it’s already come, for the most part it’s already come, but we have a lot of things that will soon be coming; planes, missiles, rockets, lots of things. But the stockpile was very depleted like everything else."
2020-03-25,08:45,Donald Trump,"This will also include significant funding for the development of vaccines on top of the $8 billion we approved several weeks ago. Over $500 billion in support for the hardest hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks, which is something I insisted on and frankly I tell you the Republicans wanted that and the Democrats wanted that. We want them to use the money for the companies and the planes or whatever they may be helping to get over this rough patch. And I don’t think it’s going to end up being such a rough patch. I think it’s going to, when we open, especially if we can open it the sooner the better, it’s going to open up like a rocket ship. I think it’s going to go very good and very quickly."
2020-03-25,09:33,Donald Trump,"You’re going to have some tough new limits on executive compensation also. They need the money. They’re going to have to sort of just make things work cause we’re interested in the workers, the jobs, and we’re interested in the companies cause that’s really what fuels the workers in those great jobs. We also have $16 billion in funding for the purchase of personal protective equipment, you know about that, such as masks and respirators through the Strategic National Stockpile."
2020-03-25,10:07,Donald Trump,"I encourage the House to pass this vital legislation and send the bill to my desk for signature without delay. I will sign it immediately. We will have a signing and it’ll be a great signing and a great day for the American worker and for American families and frankly for American companies, some of which were having the best years they’ve ever had, those last few years, and then little bit less than a month ago they went into a position that they haven’t seen because of the hidden enemy, the virus."
2020-03-25,10:43,Donald Trump,"Earlier today I spoke to the leaders of many of America’s amazing nonprofit organizations. I thank them for their unwaving and unwavering devotion to American people, to American families, to our nation. They have been fantastic. They’ve been collecting supplies, distributing food, supporting healthcare workers, caring for vulnerable workers and families. I encourage them to continue to do it, but I’ll tell you the nonprofits have been fantastic. They’ve been great. They’re great people actually. I know a lot of them."
2020-03-25,11:18,Donald Trump,"Finally, I want to provide a brief update on the critical supplies through FEMA. The federal government has delivered or is in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators, think of that 9.4 million, 20 million surgical masks and we have others that we think are going to be delivered pretty quickly. The whole world, you know it’s not just us, it’s not just the states, the whole world is trying to get these things, so in competition with many, many countries. I believe today you broke the 150 mark for the virus. We have 150 countries, over 150 countries where you have this virus and nobody would ever believe a thing like that’s possible. Nobody could have ever seen something like this coming, but now we know and we know it can happen and happen again. And if it does, somebody’s going to be very well prepared because of what we’ve learned and how we’ve done. It’s been incredible how we’ve done."
2020-03-25,12:18,Donald Trump,"Remember, there’s more tests than anybody by far and the news, the reporters, the media always likes to bring South Korea. They called me and they told me it’s amazing, your testing procedures are amazing. Plus we have a test that’s a very high level test and it’s a test that’s very accurate. 3.1 million face shields, 2.6 million surgical gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and almost 6,000 ventilators which go to the areas of greatest needs. We sent over the last day 4,000 ventilators to New York and I spoke with the governor about that. He was happy. I spoke with the mayor also about that, Mayor de Blasio. He was very happy. It’s hard not to be happy with the job we’re doing that I can tell you."
2020-03-25,13:09,Donald Trump,"Throughout this national emergency, everyday heroes continue to step forward and demonstrate the extraordinary character of our nation, including the people behind me. By the way, these people are amazing. They are amazing people and they become, I don’t know, maybe I should just speak for myself, but to me they’ve become friends. Maybe they don’t like me. Maybe they don’t. Maybe they do. I don’t know. All I can tell you is they’re talented people, they work very hard."
2020-03-25,13:35,Donald Trump,"In Maryland, a seven-year-old boy used his own birthday money to buy meals for dozens of senior citizens. In Nevada, a college student recruited 90 of her friends to help deliver groceries and supplies to the most vulnerable. This is happening all over the country, thousands and thousands of instances. I could stand up here all day and tell you about other things. In Minnesota, hundreds of medical students have volunteered to provide childcare for hospital workers, helping to keep our doctors and nurses on the front lines fighting to save lives. These inspiring Americans remind us that we all have a role to play in winning this great national battle and it’s really a worldwide battle. We’re dealing with other nations all the time The people here are. I am a little bit. I take calls from a lot of people. They’re in trouble. A lot of countries are in big trouble."
2020-03-25,14:27,Donald Trump,"So, now we will hear from our great Secretary of the Treasury. He’s been working rather hard I will tell you. Steven Mnuchin is a fantastic guy and he loves our country and he’s been dealing with both sides, Republican and Democrats. He sort of lived over in that beautiful building. It’s a very beautiful building, to me one of the most beautiful buildings actually in the world, and he’s gotten to know it, Steve, very well. So if we could have a little update Steve would be fantastic as to how we’re doing and what it’s looking like. Thank you."
2020-03-25,15:02,Steve Mnuchin,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. First let me say, I would like to thank Mitch McConnell for his leadership and I’d also like to thank Chuck Schumer for the enormous bipartisan support we had on this bill and the many senators, both Republicans and Democrats that worked tirelessly over the last five days on all the task force. As the President said, I got to live in the LBJ Room for the last five days and we couldn’t be more pleased with the unprecedented response from the Senate to protect American workers and American business in this situation."
2020-03-25,15:39,Steve Mnuchin,"The President has outlined many of these, but let me just quickly go through them. Again, small business retention loans. This will cover roughly 50% of the private payroll in small businesses where we will immediately make loans that will supply eight weeks of salaries as long as they keep workers employed and overhead. Those loans will be forgiven at the end of the period as long as they keep workers employed. These are SBA loans, but the Treasury will be issuing new regulations authorizing almost every single FDIC insured bank to make these. I expect by the end of next week we will have a very simple process where these can be made and dispersed in the same day, so this will be a very simple system to get money into small business hands."
2020-03-25,16:33,Steve Mnuchin,"For companies that don’t qualify that we have a economic program of tax incentives to retain workers, and as the President said we have enhanced unemployment insurance for people don’t fit into these two programs that will be administered through the states. We also have economic impact payments. These will be within the next three weeks direct payments into most people’s deposit accounts and for those that don’t have it we will be having the checks in the mail. Treasury will have additional authorities. We have $500 billion that we can use to work with the Federal Reserve for emergency programs that will create up to an additional $4 trillion if needed to support American business and American workers in an unprecedented way. And then finally, the President mentioned $100 billion to hospitals and $150 billion to states that have specific Coronavirus expenses as well as many additional things."
2020-03-25,17:38,Steve Mnuchin,"Mr. President, I especially want to thank you and the Vice President. You were constantly available to us. We spoke constantly throughout the day. You gave us guidance and quick decisions on many issues, and again thank everybody for this great bipartisan work. This is going to be enormous help for the American workers and the American economy. The President was very determined that Congress would move swiftly to protect hardworking Americans and business in this unprecedented situation."
2020-03-25,18:07,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Steve. Great job. Day and night, right?"
2020-03-25,18:11,Steve Mnuchin,[inaudible 00:18:11].
2020-03-25,18:11,Donald Trump,"Day and night we were [inaudible 00:18:13]. That was a lot of work and we’ll see how it all goes. We still need a vote, Steve, don’t we? Do you have a question? Yes."
2020-03-25,18:20,Unnamed,How long do you think this bill will keep the economy afloat?
2020-03-25,18:23,Donald Trump,"Hopefully a long time. You know, we’ll see. If we have to go back, we have to go back. We’re going to take care of the American worker. We’re going to take care of these companies that fuel this country and make the country great. It’s not their fault. It’s not their fault, but we think…"
2020-03-25,18:37,Steve Mnuchin,"I would say, we have anticipated three months. Hopefully you won’t need this for three months. Hopefully this war will be won quicker, but we expect that this is a significant amount of money if needed to cover the economy."
2020-03-25,18:52,Donald Trump,"And don’t forget, a lot of this is going to be to keep companies that are very strong, AAA-rated companies previously, to keep them going and it’s going to be in the form of loans, so the money’s going to come back. This money’s…"
2020-03-25,19:03,Donald Trump,"And it’s going to be in the form of loans, so the money’s going to come back. A lot of this money’s coming back."
2020-03-25,19:05,Steve (Reporter),"Separately, let me ask you about something you said yesterday. You said we should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival."
2020-03-25,19:13,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-25,19:13,Steve (Reporter),What did you mean by that?
2020-03-25,19:14,Donald Trump,"Well, I’ve been saying that for a long time. Well, we’re reliant on many countries, where we give up our supply chains. We give up our factories. We give up our production facilities and we can buy it someplace else for a little bit lower price. But it’s really costing us more when that happens, because we lose jobs, we lose everything and we lose our independence and we can’t let that happen. So we’ll be making some changes. We have been making those changes."
2020-03-25,19:39,Steve (Reporter),[Inaudible 00:19:39] considering an executive order to basically ban the export of medical equipment?
2020-03-25,19:43,Donald Trump,"I don’t know that we’ll need that, but I think it’s happening by itself. I think a lot of things are happening. Well, we make the best medical equipment in the world, and you have some people like the European Union, they don’t take it because they have specifications that don’t allow our equipment in because it’s designed in a different way, even though it’s a better way. It’s designed. They’re all playing games against us, okay. They’ve been playing games against us for years and no president has ever done anything about it."
2020-03-25,20:16,Donald Trump,"But the European Union, you look at medical equipment, we make the best medical equipment in the world, but we can’t sell it, or not appropriately. And yet we take their medical equipment in our country. We’re changing things, Steve. All of this is changing. But they have specifications, designed specifically, so that our equipment can’t come into their countries. It’s a very terrible thing that’s happened to our country."
2020-03-25,20:46,Donald Trump,"And let me tell you some of the people that took the biggest advantage of us, our allies. We talk about allies, they took advantage of us in many ways, financially as well as even militarily. Look, if you look at NATO, the abuse that was given to our country on NATO, where they wouldn’t pay, and we were paying for everybody. Now, because of me, they’re paying a lot. Now, they’ve paid 125, 135, billion dollars more."
2020-03-25,21:23,Donald Trump,"And then ultimately Secretary General Stoltenberg, who I think you would say is maybe my biggest fan, we got him to pay an additional $400 billion, billion, other countries. But you know that. And then there’s the trade. They make it almost impossible for us to have a fair deal. They know this. They know I’m just waiting. We have all the advantages, by the way. It’s going to be easy when I decide to do it, but this isn’t the right time to do it. But we’ve been treated very, very unfairly by the European union."
2020-03-25,21:56,Donald Trump,"Please, go ahead."
2020-03-25,21:57,Unnamed,"Mr. President, four Republican senators have indicated that the extra $600 for unemployment insurance may encourage workers to leave their jobs, even though you can only collect unemployment if you’re fired. I’m curious what you think of that concern."
2020-03-25,22:13,Donald Trump,"I know the issue very well. We talked about it just a little while ago. I’ll let, Steve, I’m going to let you maybe discuss that."
2020-03-25,22:19,Steve Mnuchin,"Sure. Now, the president, I spoke to several of those senators today. But let me explain the issue, which is we wanted to have enhanced unemployment insurance. Most of the States systems have technology that’s 30 years old or older. So if we had the ability to customize this with much more specifics, we would have. This was the only way we could assure that the States could get money out quickly, in a fair way. So we used $600 across the board. And I don’t think it’ll create incentives. Most Americans, what they want, they want to keep their jobs. And I said for 50% of these businesses, they will have the businesses keep those jobs. Our number one issue was how do we make sure that American workers who needed to keep getting paid, this is no fault of their own, that businesses have been shut down. The president and vice president wanted to make sure those hardworking Americans got money and this was the most efficient way of doing it."
2020-03-25,23:19,Unnamed,"The senators that you spoke with, are they in agreement now?"
2020-03-25,23:22,Steve Mnuchin,"I’m not going to comment on the specifics of where they are, but I would say, our expectation is this bill passes tonight and gets to the house tomorrow and they pass it. We need to get this money into the American economy and American workers. That’s the importance of this."
2020-03-25,23:38,Donald Trump,"The one good thing, when you think about that, people would get actually more money, but we don’t want to give a disincentive. But they have been talking about that. It’s a good question, actually. Yes, ma’am, please."
2020-03-25,23:49,Unnamed,"Yes, thank you. On another subject, the family of retired FBI agent, Robert Levinson, says that US officials have concluded that he’s died in Iranian custody. Are you aware of that? And how did US officials reach that conclusion?"
2020-03-25,24:05,Donald Trump,"I’ve been very much involved in that. He was a great gentleman and a great family. I have to say this and they’ve been making the statement to the family, I believe, but it’s not looking good. He wasn’t well for years, anyway, in Iran. It’s not looking promising. We’ve gotten so many people back. We got two people back this week, but Robert Levinson, who was outstanding, he’s been sick for a long time. He had some rough problems prior to his detainment or capture. We feel terribly for the family."
2020-03-25,24:49,Unnamed,Do you accept that he is dead?
2020-03-25,24:51,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t accept that he’s dead. I don’t accept it. I’m telling you, it’s not looking great, but I won’t accept that he’s dead. They haven’t told us that he’s dead. But a lot of people are thinking that that is the case. Feel badly about it."
2020-03-25,25:07,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you tweeted earlier, linking the closing of the country to your election success in November. Is this Easter timeline based on your political interests?"
2020-03-25,25:19,Donald Trump,What do you mean by election success? No.
2020-03-25,25:19,Unnamed,You tweeted. You said that the media wants the country to remain closed to hurt your odds of being reelected.
2020-03-25,25:24,Donald Trump,"No, no, no. I think the media would like to see me do poorly in the election."
2020-03-25,25:28,Unnamed,"Sir, lawmakers and economists on both sides of the aisle have said that reopening the country by Easter is not a good idea. What is that plan based on?"
2020-03-25,25:34,Donald Trump,"Just so you understand. Are you ready? I think there are certain people that would like it not to open so quickly. I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls. And I don’t know if that’s so, but I do think it’s so that there are people in your profession that would like that to happen. I think it’s very clear."
2020-03-25,25:58,Unnamed,Your own medical expert does not endorse that plan.
2020-03-25,25:59,Donald Trump,"I think it’s very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news. You do. She does. There are people in your profession that write fake news. They would love to see me, for whatever reason, because we’ve done one hell of a job. Nobody’s done the job that we’ve done. And it’s lucky that you have this group here, right now, for this problem or you wouldn’t even have a country left. Okay."
2020-03-25,26:23,Donald Trump,"Go ahead in the back, please."
2020-03-25,26:24,Unnamed,"Mr. President, two questions. The first one, once you sign the $2 trillion package, how soon or how rapidly do you expect to see economic-"
2020-03-25,26:30,Donald Trump,Who you with?
2020-03-25,26:35,Unnamed,"I’m with CBN. And my second question is, we are hearing you are pushing for April 6, to have direct payments issued to tax payers. Is that the target date?"
2020-03-25,26:41,Donald Trump,"I think it’s pretty much, yeah."
2020-03-25,26:42,Steve Mnuchin,"Again, I would say our expectation is within three weeks, we will have direct payments out where we have depository information. And we’re looking to get a lot more information and we have procedures to do that. So three weeks for that. And I would say the end of next week, we want all the banks to be able to originate loans, same day."
2020-03-25,27:03,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for you. One is this, that tomorrow you’re going to be speaking with the G20 leaders, and I want to know if you’re going to lead an effort to craft a worldwide ban on wild animal markets, so as to prevent another pandemic, given that COVID-19 is a zoonotic that was transferred to humans in trade of exotic animals?"
2020-03-25,27:23,Donald Trump,"I don’t know that that subject’s going to come up. There is a lot of talk that that’s how this all happened. Came out of China, and they say that’s how it happened in China. So it’s something maybe it will be talked about, but it’s not the top of my list. I think we’re going to have a very good conference tomorrow."
2020-03-25,27:40,Unnamed,"And to follow up, also Dr. Ashish Jha, who is the head of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, says that the key to getting this economy open as soon as possible is to test everyone who needs testing so we can quarantine all infected individuals and allow everyone else to go back to work immediately. Would you subscribe to that strategy?"
2020-03-25,27:59,Donald Trump,"No, but we have tested more than anybody. I saw him."
2020-03-25,28:02,Unnamed,"And if not, how many deaths are acceptable?"
2020-03-25,28:05,Donald Trump,"Yeah. How many? None. Okay. How many deaths are acceptable to me? None. Okay. None. If that’s your question. Look, I saw him. I saw his statement. We have tested, by far, more than anybody. We’re testing more than anybody right now. There’s nobody even close. And our tests are the best tests. They’re the most accurate tests. But if you’re saying we’re going to test 350 million people, I watched his statement, I disagree with it."
2020-03-25,28:36,Donald Trump,"We can go to certain States. I could name them now, but I’m not going to do that. But we can go to certain States right now. They have virtually no problem or a very small problem. We don’t have to test the entire state in the Middle West or wherever they may be. We don’t have to test the entire state. I think it’s ridiculous. We don’t have to do it. A lot of those States could go back right now and they probably will, because at some point in the not too distant future, certain States are going to come off the rolls. Maybe New York can’t and maybe California can’t. Maybe the state of Washington can’t. Although if you look at them, their biggest problem was in one nursing home. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-03-25,29:14,Unnamed,"But the States aren’t siloed. And so if you test one state and then the person moves over to the other state, well then."
2020-03-25,29:21,Donald Trump,"Yeah, you’re going to look at that. But if you take a look at the States and many States that I’m talking about, they don’t have a problem. We have some big problems, but it’s confined to certain areas, high density areas. So why would we test the entire nation, 350 people? With that being said, I’m going to say it again, we tested far more than anybody else. We have the ability to test… we’ve come a long way from an obsolete, broken system that I inherited. We have now tested, with the best test, far more than anybody else. When I say anybody else, I’m talking about other countries. No country is even close."
2020-03-25,29:59,Donald Trump,"They came out with a statistic, I guess a yesterday, that I heard from Dr. Burks where it’s for eight days here, more than eight weeks in South Korea. And South Korea has done a good job, but we did in eight days more than South Korea did in eight weeks. That’s a big number. And we’re getting, I said before, exponentially better. Every day is going up substantially. We have an incredible apparatus built, now. But no, I don’t want to test 350 million people. I think it’s ridiculous."
2020-03-25,30:36,Donald Trump,"Yes, please."
2020-03-25,30:36,Unnamed,"Thank you so much, Mr. President. Two questions. One follow up on the G20, because the UN asked the G20 countries for more resources, for a coordinated seamless package, ban all tariffs, waive all sanctions, to try to prevent what they call an apocalyptic pandemic. Would you consider those measures and-"
2020-03-25,30:56,Donald Trump,With respect to what?
2020-03-25,30:59,Unnamed,On tariffs and related also to waive tariffs and also sanctions.
2020-03-25,31:05,Donald Trump,"Look, we have strong borders."
2020-03-25,31:08,Unnamed,Would you consider to join this global effort?
2020-03-25,31:10,Donald Trump,"Before I came here, we weren’t into borders. We had a country people could come in. We had a whole different deal. Now we’re up to almost 164 miles. Think of that, 164 miles of wall, big beautiful wall and in those areas it’s very, very tough to come in. We’ve been very tough on the borders. Where we have the wall built, nobody’s getting through. Now, they’re going around, but that’s a long trip. If they’re going around, that’s the way they get through. No, I’m very strong on borders and I don’t want people coming in here. What I want is, if they’re going to come in, they have to come in legally. They have to come in through merit. We’re not having the people that you’re talking about coming to our country."
2020-03-25,31:55,Unnamed,"Mr. President, a followup on another question."
2020-03-25,31:55,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-25,31:55,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. A question for you and for Dr. Fauci, if you’ll let me. Both Republican and Democrat packages of the stimulus, included $25 million worth of funding for the Kennedy Performance Art Center, here in Washington, DC. Shouldn’t that money be going to masks, respirators?"
2020-03-25,32:15,Donald Trump,"Well, I approved that. And I knew… it was 35 million and we actually took off 10. But I’m a fan of that, although I haven’t spent time there because I’m far too busy. I’d love to go there evenings, but I’m too busy doing things, because that’s more important for me than going there. But the Kennedy Center has suffered greatly, because nobody can go there. It’s essentially closed. They do need some funding. I said, look, that was a Democrat request. That was not my request, but you’ve got to give them something. It’s something that they wanted. It works that way. Democrats have treated us fairly. I really believe that we’ve had a very good back and forth. And I say that with respect to Chuck Schumer. I spoke to him a number of times, but they had requests also. So that was a request."
2020-03-25,33:03,Donald Trump,"There were 35, as you know, and it came down to 25. We got it down to 25. We agreed. I said, “That’s a lousy soundbite. That’s not a good sound bite.” But that’s the way life works. With that being said, the Kennedy Center, they do a beautiful job, an incredible job. David Rubenstein does a fantastic job. He’s very much involved and he puts up a lot of money and he does things that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do, or do. But they’ve been essentially closed. They have tremendous deficits that are built up. This thing has been devastating to it. So I didn’t have a big problem with it, but this was a request from the Democrats, because of the fact that they have a facility that’s essentially closed up."
2020-03-25,33:43,Unnamed,"Another question, sir."
2020-03-25,33:44,Donald Trump,"Otherwise you couldn’t go there if you wanted to. If I wanted to go there tonight to look at Romeo and Juliet, I’d love to see Romeo and Juliet tonight. You know what would happen? They say, “Sorry.” 250 people or 50 people, whatever it might be down to. Go ahead."
2020-03-25,33:57,Unnamed,"And then earlier today, Senator Marco Rubio told RCP that, “The World Health Organization showed favoritism to China.” and then Representative Michael McCaul, the ranking member on the house foreign relations committee, he questioned the integrity of the World Health Organization’s director, saying, “That there were several red flags in his past with respect to his relationship with China.” Do you agree? Do you think the World Health Organization showed favoritism and then once all the dust settles, do you think that the United States should re-explore its relationship with the World Health Organization?"
2020-03-25,34:30,Donald Trump,"I think there is certainly a lot of talk that has been very unfair. I think that a lot of people feel that it’s been very unfair. It’s been very, very much sided with China and a lot of people are not happy about it. At the same time, Dr. Fauci and myself and other people, there are people on there that we like and we know. A lot of, I think your friends, are on there. A lot of good people, a lot of good professionals. I don’t know, it’d be interesting to hear if you’d like to talk about the WHO, but the fact is that, I have heard for years that that is very much biased toward China. So I don’t know."
2020-03-25,35:08,Donald Trump,"Dr., you want me to get you into this political mess?"
2020-03-25,35:10,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, I don’t want you to do that, but I will. So Tedros is really an outstanding person. I’ve known him from the time that he was the minister of health of Ethiopia. Obviously, over the years, anyone who says that the WHO has not had problems, has not been watching the WHO. But I think under his leadership, they’ve done very well. He has been all over this. I was on the phone with him a few hours ago leading a WHO call."
2020-03-25,35:37,Unnamed,"Praising China’s transparency, sir?"
2020-03-25,35:39,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, I’m not talking about China. You asked me about Tedros."
2020-03-25,35:43,Unnamed,World Heath Organization praising China for its transparency and leadership on their response to the pandemic?
2020-03-25,35:48,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I can’t comment on that, because I don’t have any viewpoint into it. I don’t even know what your question is."
2020-03-25,35:57,Unnamed,"Can I follow up on that phone call, please?"
2020-03-25,35:59,Donald Trump,"Welcome to the group. Let me just tell you, I have heard that for years. I spoke to him yesterday. Seems fine to me. I don’t know. But we’re the ones that gave the great response and we’re the ones that kept China out of here. And if I didn’t do it, you’d have thousands and thousands of people who would have died, that are now living and happy. If I didn’t do that early call on China, and nobody wanted that to happen. Everybody thought it was unnecessary to do it, and if we didn’t do that, thousands and thousands of people would’ve died, more than what’s happened. So that’s it. Maybe one more. Steve, go ahead."
2020-03-25,36:36,Steve (Reporter),"When you have this G20 meeting tomorrow, what sort of coordinated response are you expecting?"
2020-03-25,36:40,Donald Trump,"No coordinated… we’re going to have a meeting with the 20 nations total, including us. It’ll be a conference call tomorrow morning sometime. I look forward to people I know, I like. I think in every instance I like every one of them, but it’ll be an interesting call. You’ll be the first to know."
2020-03-25,36:59,Steve (Reporter),"Next week when the 15 day period ends, what should we expect then? Are you going to extend it for another week or two?"
2020-03-25,37:05,Donald Trump,"We’ll be talking. I’ll be speaking with Tony. I’ll be speaking with Deborah. I’ll be speaking with some of the people that they like and respect, and they’re going to bring along with them. We’ll be speaking to Vice President Mike Pence and Steve, and we’ll be speaking to everybody. I’m not going to do anything rash or hastily. I don’t do that. But the country wants to get back to work. Our country was built to get back to work."
2020-03-25,37:29,Donald Trump,"We don’t have a country where they say, “Hey, let’s close it down for two years.” We can’t do that. It’s not our country. So we’re going to be talking, and it could be we’ll do sections of our country. There’s big sections of our country that are very little affected by what’s taken place. Then there are other sections that are very heavily affected, so there’s a big difference. But no, I would say by Easter we’ll have a recommendation and maybe before Easter, and at the end of the 15th day or even during the 15th day, I think we’ll have some kind of a recommendation, but our country wants to get back to…"
2020-03-25,38:03,Donald Trump,"Did they? I think we’ll have some kind of a recommendation, but our country wants to get back to work, Steve. I have had so many people and they want to practice social distancing and they want to practice no handshaking, no handshaking. They’re not going to go walk around hugging and kissing each other in the office where they come back. Even though they may feel like it. They’re going to do, they’re going to wash their hands more than they’ve ever done. They’re going to do all the things you’re supposed to do. But Steve, you know what? It’s time. They want people want to get back to work. I’m having, I get it from both sides. In all fairness, and maybe it’s a combination of both. Tony said before, combination of both is sometimes very good, but there are areas that possibly, probably they won’t qualify."
2020-03-25,38:45,Donald Trump,"There are other areas that qualify almost now. So we’re going to have to see what happens, but it’ll be an interesting period of time. I’d like to get our country back. I have tremendous numbers of people wanting to go back. You have store owners where the store is sitting there, they don’t know what’s happened. They got to get back. You have businesses that are going to be closed. The longer we stay out, the longer we do it. We want to go quickly. The longer we stay out, the harder it is to bring this incredible, we were having the most successful years that we’ve ever had in the history of our country. You saw what happened yesterday with the stocks and today they’re up. I’m telling you, if Steve gets the deal done, the incredible incentive that’s going to take care of people, it’s going to take care of our workers, going to take care of companies that employ all these workers. Small and big."
2020-03-25,39:33,Donald Trump,"By the way, I would say we spend more time on the small companies, Steve, than we did under big companies. People ask about that. We spent more time thinking about the small businesses than the big and that’s, but that really fuels our country. We want to get back and the people want to get back. We want to get our country going again and we’ll be able to do that. So Vice-President is going to stay with you and going to take a few more questions specifically and I will see you tomorrow. Thank you very much. [crosstalk 00:02:03]"
2020-03-25,40:06,Unnamed,"Mr. President, a question for you on the DPA."
2020-03-25,40:15,Mike Pence,"Well, thank you all. Report on today’s action by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The president and our entire team continue to be inspired. By the way people all across this country are putting into practice 15 days to slow the spread. We are 10 days into the 15 days. And let me say again to every American, if you’re in an area that’s been impacted by the Coronavirus, it’s absolutely essential that you listen to state and local authorities for guidance. But for every American, what you can do is implement the practices outlined in the President’s coronavirus today because we truly do believe that as millions of Americans have done and will continue to do, that we can significantly impact the rate of growth in this epidemic in our country. We can spare Americans from exposure to the Coronavirus and we can save lives and so on behalf of the President and our entire task force, I want to say thank you to the American people."
2020-03-25,41:26,Mike Pence,"I thank you for your cooperation. Thank you for embracing the principles in 15 days to slow the spread. We heard about that cooperation today in a series of conference calls. We spoke with equipment manufacturers who are stepping forward as never before to assist us in developing the medical equipment that is essential, whether it be masks or other medical supplies or ventilators. FEMA reported to our task force today that hundreds of companies have stepped forward to be involved in the supply chain. And we are vetting nearly 70 of those companies for specific repurposing of their manufacturing to produce everything from mass to gloves to gowns and of course to ventilators. We also had a very productive call with Secretary Betsy DeVos with education leaders from around the country today. And let me say on behalf of the President and a grateful nation, thank you to all of our teachers, many of whom are now home teaching children from afar, even in many cases while they have their own kids home from school."
2020-03-25,42:36,Mike Pence,"You are truly heroes and the Department of Education as well as your state department of education are grateful to each and every one of you who find yourselves educating out of home. And the Department of Education has a helpful website on Coronavirus recommendations, ed.gov/coronavirus. And as we mentioned before, Secretary Betsy DeVos and Secretary Sonny Purdue will be joining us at this podium on Friday to speak about distance learning recommendations that have been made, not just for secondary or for college education, but also for K through 12 education. We’re opening up avenues, creating new flexibility so that not only college students can continue to be involved and learning from afar, but children K through 12 can do the same. Secretary Purdue will also be here to talk about the food lunch program and free and reduced lunches. Today the President and I also spoke to over 150 CEOs of the top nonprofit organizations in the country."
2020-03-25,43:43,Mike Pence,"We thanked them for their ongoing work, supplying the needs, not only of people impacted by the Coronavirus, but the most vulnerable among us in our communities. Organizations like Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Feeding America are all still working every day and we promised to urge every American if you have the means and have the ability, continue to be generous to nonprofit organizations that are helping those most in need in your community."
2020-03-25,44:13,Mike Pence,"The President marshaled a whole of government approach, that means working with our governors. Today, the president and I were in direct contact with governors of New York, California, Washington state, New Jersey, Michigan and others and we continue to be inspired and impressed by the leadership that governors are providing in their states, making tough choices, leading their states and the President and I are truly grateful. The task force made a recommendation and FEMA has assembled a team for to provide technical assistance to the state of New York and that team was welcomed by Governor Cuomo, will be arriving on the ground there very soon along with all the other resources that the President recently announced would be flowing to New York and to Washington state and to California."
2020-03-25,45:04,Mike Pence,"In my conversation with governor Gavin Newsom of California, I was pleased to speak to him and hear that our FEMA team is literally at the table with the state of California’s team working to meet their supply needs. Working to work on capacity and I want people to know in the states that are most impacted by the Coronavirus that we are with you. We’re going to stay with you and we’re going to continue to work around the clock to make sure your courageous healthcare workers, your health systems and your state governments have the resources to support your response. On the subject of testing, Dr. Birx will reflect on what the data is showing in just a moment, not including local labs and hospitals, we are at 432,000 tests completed."
2020-03-25,45:52,Mike Pence,"And we’re pleased to see that there are literally drive through and community sites around the country in the U.S. Public Health Services assisting states in standing those up each and every day. We do remind hospitals and labs around the country, the moment the President signs the bill that it, that it is absolutely essential that they provide the results of the test to us. It gives us visibility into what’s happening on the ground. But because of the public private partnership, President Trump initiated with these vast commercial lab networks around the country, we are adding tens of thousands of tests every single day."
2020-03-25,46:32,Mike Pence,"On the subject of supplies, before the end of the week we’ll talk a bit more as the president did moments ago about the supply chain. I was at FEMA last night and literally saw a room full of people with laptops and cell phones. We are literally leaving no stone unturned as I told governors today to find medical supplies. Whether it be masks or gowns or gloves or ventilators and the team is working around the clock to meet those needs."
2020-03-25,47:04,Mike Pence,"A few smaller items. First and foremost, the CDC is developing guidance, which we’ll be publishing tomorrow about the best way to utilize our natural resources at our parks. It would be several weeks ago that our park service waived all entrance fees and we directed the CDC to produce guidance for how people can still practice social distancing and common sense, but be out of doors and enjoy our natural parks. We’ll also be sharing that guidance with the vast state park systems around the country and encouraging their support with that. Let me, let me last say again. There is nothing more important for the American people to do to slow the spread than to heed your state and local guidance in areas impacted by the Coronavirus and for everyone else to put into practice the 15 days to slow the spread."
2020-03-25,48:03,Mike Pence,"Dr. Fauci will reflect on the importance of mitigation and the impact that we believe that it is having around the country. But it is, people ask me from time to time, “What can I do?” And I say from my heart to every American, this is what you can do, not just to protect your own health and that of your family, but no American wants to inadvertently spread the Coronavirus, particularly to those that may be vulnerable to serious health consequences. Remember that the risk of serious illness to the average American remains low. I mean the vast majority of people that contract the Coronavirus will have mild symptoms to flu like symptoms and and, and will recover. But for seniors with serious underlying health conditions or with people with immuno-deficiencies, everyone needs to practice the principles of 15 days to slow the spread. The President announced this week that we are looking forward to the day that we can open up the country and this team will be bringing him recommendations about how we can safely and responsibly do just that. But for every American that wants to see America back in business, you can hasten the day by putting into practice the 15 days to slow the spread. Go to coronavirus.gov for details and I truly do believe if all of us will do all that we can do, we will slow the spread. We will protect the most vulnerable and we will heal our land. With that, let me recognize Dr. Tony Fauci, to speak about… Oh, Dr. Birx please and then Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-25,49:41,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Oh, thank you Mr. Vice President and thank you all for listening to us talk to the American people. We’ve been watching the testing results, it’s very critical to us. It’s very to be looking at that very carefully. Let me tell you two things that are going on in parallel. Our system to look at flu like illnesses is still up and running and in county after county and state after state. And why is that important for those who’ve been following the flu epidemic this year? You’ll remember we had Flu A, then we had another peak of Flu B."
2020-03-25,50:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And those systems that are in every single state and local government is the platform where we can see whether there’s any increase in flu-like illnesses. So if you have very few cases in your state and in your counties, maintain your flu surveillance system that you work closely with the CDC on. And look for changes in your slope of new flu-like illnesses and there are enough test kits and there’s particularly enough of the CDC test kit where we started that runs on your flu surveillance platform to be constantly surveilling what those flu-like illnesses are in our states and counties that have very low number of cases."
2020-03-25,50:56,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We have counties still with zero to one cases, but they can participate in their surveillance that we need to have out there now by using their flu-like surveillance system and we thank all of the states who have that up and running. If you go to cdc.gov and go to flu surveillance, you can see state by state and you can be looking at those curves with us. It’s what we’re looking at day by day in addition to the testing results that are coming in. For the testing results still on, there’s four counties that constitute the majority of both the current cases and new cases. I think you know those are New York City, Westchester, New York Suffolk and Nassau county. Those are the four counties all associated with New York and the New York Metro area. There’s a few counties in New Jersey, but this is still where 56% of the cases are and 56% of the new cases."
2020-03-25,51:53,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It’s very important that people look at the number of new cases per day. Remember we told you it was going to take us a while to work through the testing backlog? I think we are close to working through the testing backlog so that you can interpret the number of cases per day and you will see in New York City that the number of cases per day has been relatively constant over the last three days. Those are the number of new cases per day. This is a real call to every person in New York City, in the New York Metro area, to continue every one of these 15 days to slow the spread and to do that part of that at the same time that they’re following the mayors and governors piece."
2020-03-25,52:35,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yesterday we talked about people that may have left the Metro area that were residents, residents of the Metro area that may have gone to secondary homes or other places to reside. And we’ve asked all of them to carefully monitor their temperatures and self-isolate from the communities where they went just to ensure their own health and the health of their communities while people move around the country."
2020-03-25,52:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, why this is so important? It’s very important to me personally because my grandmother for 88 years lived with the fact that she was the one at age 11 who brought home flu to her mother named Leah, for which I am named. When her mother had just delivered and her mother succumbed to the great 1918 flu. She never forgot that she was the child that was in school that innocently brought that flu home. This is why we keep saying to every American, you have a role to protect each and every person that you interact with. We have a role to protect one another. It’s why we are social distancing and you are social distancing. But to every American out there, when you are protecting yourself, you’re protecting others. And if you inadvertently, I know, brought this virus home to someone with a preexisting condition, I can tell you my grandmother lived with that for 88 years. So this is what we’re trying. This is the message that’s important to everybody. This is not a theoretic. This is a reality. You can see the number of deaths that are occurring. We all have a role in preventing them, so thank you for the work that you do to get our message out to others. To really ensure that every American understands how important their role is as we move through these next five days to not let up for an instant. I hear some reports that someone said, “Oh well, the new cases in New York are increasing,” or “the hospitalizations are increasing.” The number of new cases over the last three days have been consistent but not rising any more than a consistent day over day rise. You will see hospital cases continue to increase because they are a reflection of what happened one to two weeks ago before the full mitigation efforts were put into place. So each person in every place, no matter what county, what community, what state can work with us to ensure that we prevent the spread of this virus to others. So thank you."
2020-03-25,55:10,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you, Mr. Vice-President. I just want to spend a couple of minutes telling you a little bit about some information that I got on our weekly call that we have at least once a week with the WHO, which is led by Dr. Tedros and Mike Ryan, who is the point man there to give us some information. And in that regard, I want to apologize for my curt response to you when you asked me about the China deal because I shouldn’t have done that. That’s not my style. But what I really wanted to say is that my job is that I’m a scientist. I’m a physician. And I’m a public health person and I don’t like to get involved in that stuff. So anyway, getting back to the WHO. So we learned some really interesting information because obviously the other countries like China and others have had been hit prior that we did."
2020-03-25,55:55,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"One of the things that was striking to me, and I just throw it out because it’s something that we will face, we’re not facing it now, but we will face. Our Chinese colleagues are very concerned because they went through the entire cycle of the curve to come down and they have very, very few cases. But what they’re starting to see as they’re relaxing the constraints on travel, that they’re getting imported cases and they wanted to warn us that when we get successful, make sure you very carefully examine how you’re going to release the constraints on inputs."
2020-03-25,56:34,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So I know we’re going to be successful in putting this on the control, but I think we’re going to have to remember, we don’t want to import cases in. That’s the first thing for today. The second thing that was important is that it was something that Dr. Birx mentioned. And that is when you look at the inflection of the curves, we now have multiple different countries that have gone through various phases of their individual outbreaks, and you could learn something from them."
2020-03-25,57:02,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And you could learn something from them about where you are in your own outbreak. For example, when China went up, what happened is they just didn’t turn around. They went from going to, I’ll just take an arbitrary number, 500 new cases a day. The next day it was 1000 cases, then 1500 and then 2000, but once the number of new cases each day starts to flatten out, that’s when you get to that point where the inflection goes down. So, things we want to look for, the things that Dr. Birx had mentioned, that doesn’t mean you declare victory when it does that, but you know you’re at least on the way to where you want to go, and I think that’s really very important."
2020-03-25,57:45,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The third and final thing that I think gets back to the question that many of you in the audience have asked of us is about would this possibly become a seasonal cyclic thing? And I’ve always indicated to you that I think it very well might. And the reason I say that is that what we’re starting to see now in the southern hemisphere, in southern Africa, and in the southern hemisphere countries, is that we’re having cases that are appearing as they go into their winter season, and if in fact they have a substantial outbreak, it will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we’ll get a cycle around the second time."
2020-03-25,58:25,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What does that mean for us in what we’re doing? It totally emphasizes the need to do what we’re doing in developing a vaccine, testing it quickly, and trying to get it ready so that we’ll have a vaccine available for that next cycle. In addition, to do the randomized controlled trials of drugs, so that we will have a menu of drugs that we have shown to be effective and shown to be safe, because I know we’ll be successful in putting this down now, but we really need to be prepared for another cycle, and what we’re doing I believe will prepare us well. Thank you."
2020-03-25,58:59,Mike Pence,"Thanks, Doc. We’ll take a few questions. Please."
2020-03-25,59:03,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, on ventilators, some really important reporting from the Center of Public Integrity today, they suggested that there’s only 16,000 in the national stockpile. Can you just give us some clarity? How many ventilators do you have in the national stockpile? Who else is making them and how long will it take for them to make a critical mass? Because based on the Center for Public Integrity, it appears there aren’t enough if you live or you die as a result."
2020-03-25,59:25,Mike Pence,"Ventilators has been a singular focus of a good portion of our Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force at FEMA since the President stood up on FEMA’s National Response Center, and we’re making progress in a variety of ways. First, there is the national stockpile which you refer, and depending on what’s been distributed, we just delivered 4,000 ventilators to New York, including ventilators that we sent to New York City, but there’s that number of some 20,000, less than 20,000, I won’t dispute your number. Beyond that, there literally are, by most estimates, more than 150,000 ventilators in the broad healthcare system all across the country. We also, working with anesthesiologists and there was a very important conference call today, we have determined several weeks ago that the devices that anesthesiologists use for outpatient surgery can be converted with the change of a single vent to a very useful ventilator."
2020-03-25,01:00:35,Mike Pence,"I actually spoke to Governor Cuomo about that today. He’s in the process of serving all of his surgical centers, as governors around the country are doing. We literally believe there’s tens of thousands of ventilators that can be converted now that the FDA has given guidance. And Dr. Birx can probably speak to that in a moment. We actually have produced a helpful video to explain how quickly those devices can be converted. But we’re also working with General Motors and other companies to immediately spin up production. Those contracts are being reviewed. We’re vetting their capability."
2020-03-25,01:01:14,Mike Pence,"But one of the other ideas is as we look at areas of the country that are most impacted, and now more than half of the cases for coronavirus are in New York state and in the region around there, but we’ll want to focus our resources, including ventilators, on where communities are struggling the most with coronavirus. And so one of the ways that we’re working through that at FEMA now is by spinning up production and at the same time working with the existing national supply, maybe from areas that don’t have a particular burden yet with the coronavirus, and making sure that we’re manufacturing, backfilling and meeting that need."
2020-03-25,01:01:56,Mike Pence,"But what I can tell you is we’ve got an extraordinary team. Admiral [inaudible 01:02:00] is a two star Navy Admiral who’s doing an incredible job. We literally are identifying resources around the country and around the world. We’re contracting and arranging transportation for those. But maybe, Dr. Birx, you can speak to the ventilator, quickly transition."
2020-03-25,01:02:19,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. Thank you, sir. So I just want to thank Dr. Mary Peterson and the whole team of the American Association of Anesthesiologists because they immediately, when we asked them, could these be modified, they went to immediate work on it. They’re going to have Q and A’s up for, but more importantly, every anesthesiologist in every city has been working with their state and local health officials to really work with them how to change this. And I think that it’s not only the ventilators that they’ll be supplying, they have the people that run those ventilators that are not any longer doing elective surgery. So changing that elective surgery piece over a week ago has freed up lot of additional resources."
2020-03-25,01:02:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"When I talk to you about how we are, we’ve done some things that are very horizontal across the country, but we’re collecting data now in a county by county granular way. So it’s like any epidemic. It’s not equal everywhere. There are places that are very spared, and there’s places where there’s more. We have a very vast country with a lot of capacity and a lot of infrastructure, and so looking very specifically about where the virus has been, where is it going, who has got freed up resources from where it has been, because it didn’t hit all, it hit Washington state earlier than it hit New York, and looking at all of those pieces to really ensure how we can innovatively move equipment around based on the need. And so I know that it has become a place where people are looking at numbers rather than what is needed."
2020-03-25,01:03:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Because if you do these projections, when you got to those projections that said like in Germany and others, that implied that 60% or 50% of the population would get infected, I want to be very clear. The only way that happens is if this virus remains continuously moving through populations in this cycle, in the fall cycle, and another cycle. So that’s through three cycles with nothing being done. And so we’re dealing with the cycle A right now, not the one that could come in the fall of 2020, or though we’re getting prepared for it by the innovations that are being worked on, and not the 2021, we’re really dealing with the here and now, why we’re planning for the future. And I think the numbers that have been put out there are actually very frightening to people. But I can tell you, if you go back and look at Wuhan and Hubei, and all of these provinces, when they talk about 60,000 people being infected, even if you said, “Oh, right, well there’s asymptomatics,” and all of that, so you get to 600,000 people out of 80 million."
2020-03-25,01:05:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That is no where close to the numbers that you see people putting out there. I think it is frightened the American people. I think on a model that you just run full out, you can get to those numbers if you have zero controls and you do nothing, and we know that every American is doing something. And so I think what our job right now is, is to carefully detail on a hospital by hospital, state by state, county by county, to outline what the infrastructure needs are and ensure that we’re meeting them, both from the stockpile and from the generosity and movement of the American people and other hospitals."
2020-03-25,01:05:43,Unnamed,"Dr. Birx, a lot of folks out there, well intentioned, are sewing cloth masks and donating them to hospitals. Can you or Dr. Fauci, can you weigh in on that because obviously these people have great intentions, but there’s some mixed feedback on whether that’s a good idea, better than nothing?"
2020-03-25,01:05:58,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I’m sorry, what [crosstalk 01:05:58]?"
2020-03-25,01:05:58,Unnamed,"For the surgical masks. People are sewing them, so clothing manufacturers, volunteers dropping them off at hospitals, is that necessary? Is that helpful? Is it something you’d recommend?"
2020-03-25,01:06:08,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, I mean, you would only recommend that under desperate situations if you don’t have any masks, but what we’re seeing now as you’ve heard, is a rather significant inflow of masks that are coming in that are going to be available. I mean, obviously if you don’t have a mask and you need a mask and it’s appropriate for you to wear it, you do what you can, but I don’t see that now as a necessity given what’s going on right now."
2020-03-25,01:06:32,Mike Pence,Great. Great. We’ll take a couple more things. Thanks. Go ahead.
2020-03-25,01:06:35,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We can keep hearing reports of competition among states that are trying to apply this necessary equipment onto a private market. And the Governor of Kentucky said yesterday that his state was in line to buy some equipment, but FEMA came in and purchased it from under them. So he says this is creating a problem for states because on the one hand they’re being told to get the equipment themselves if they can. But on the other hand, the federal government is buying up the supply chain. So is this a problem that you’re hearing about and what is your advice to states like Kentucky that are having this issue?"
2020-03-25,01:07:10,Mike Pence,"I actually spoke to the Governor of Michigan today, Governor Whitmer and I, about just that. And we put our FEMA regional representative right on the case. We want to make sure that we’re acquiring every bit as much as we can through FEMA, but as we’ve worked with the supply chain, we want to have full coordination with the states, and of course they’re making in hospitals that they’re making. And we’re looking into those matters."
2020-03-25,01:07:41,Mike Pence,"But make no mistake about it. This FEMA team at the President’s direction is leaning into this effort, leaving no stone unturned, literally searching not just the nation but the world for all of these critical supplies, and as the President just a reported to you, we’re in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators, 20 million surgical masks, 3.1 million face shields, and the list goes on, and we’re going to be shipping those every single day. But as I told Governor Whitmer today, who’s leading her state through all of this with great energy, we want to partner with her. We want to partner with every governor and make sure that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing in terms of acquiring resources."
2020-03-25,01:08:29,Mike Pence,"[crosstalk 01:08:29] Or, how about you right here."
2020-03-25,01:08:31,Unnamed,Thank you so much.
2020-03-25,01:08:31,Mike Pence,"No, right here."
2020-03-25,01:08:31,Unnamed,"Oh, thank you."
2020-03-25,01:08:34,Unnamed,Then can I ask the next one.
2020-03-25,01:08:35,Mike Pence,Thank you. Go ahead.
2020-03-25,01:08:36,Unnamed,"On the mask question, healthcare workers on the ground still report that there are mask shortages. What timeline do you predict for making sure everyone who needs a mask is adequately supplied?"
2020-03-25,01:08:50,Mike Pence,"Well, I’m going to let Dr. Birx address that as well, but let me say again, I just received a report, we’re going to be detailing it before the end of the week, where we’ve literally identified significant resources, not just around the country but around the world, of the masks that can be used by healthcare workers. But as Dr. Birx said, we are focusing those resources in the areas where health care workers are most exposed to the prospect of contracting the coronavirus. The President’s made it clear from early on, right after seeing the needs of Americans who are struggling with the coronavirus, making sure they have the support that they need on the same level of priority. We want our healthcare workers to have the personal protective equipment to be able to do their job safely and we’re working on that."
2020-03-25,01:09:48,Mike Pence,"I will tell you, I spoke about this today to several governors, not only the Governor of Michigan, but the Governor of Indiana and President Trump and I couldn’t be more grateful the way governors around the country are joining us in calling on businesses to go back to their warehouses and identify industrial masks, N95 masks, that because of the change that President Trump insisted on in the law can now be used by hospital workers. And they’re perfectly acceptable to protect a healthcare worker from the possibility of a respiratory disease."
2020-03-25,01:10:24,Mike Pence,"But we’re calling on and our governors are joining us in calling on every business across America during this time of great challenge, where many businesses are idled, go back to your store houses, identify N95 industrial masks, and as I told our governors today, they can call FEMA, they can call the state healthcare services, or they can just load them up on a flat bed and drive them over to their local hospital. And literally we hear stories in every state in the union of people doing that. And so it’s happening all at the same time and we’ll be detailing the progress we’re making on masks. Anything further, Deb?"
2020-03-25,01:11:04,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I just wanted to add one piece and this is really a call to every state out there and every county that has been doing community based testing. The FDA put out new guidance, we talked about it several days ago, that people can do self-testing in the drive through, where you give them the materials to do it in their car, and you pick it up in a biohazard bag. This would free up all of that PPE that you see being utilized in those drive throughs back to the hospitals and back to the clinics that need it the most. We have to move to the new technology. FDA worked tirelessly to get that out there so that it could be sparing of gowns, and gloves, and full respiratory N95s. This is the moment to move to that self-testing front of nose with the new applicators that can be utilized, so that every single bit of the N95s can be put into the hospitals that need it. [crosstalk 01:12:09]."
2020-03-25,01:12:12,Mike Pence,"Let me just say, we look forward to seeing you all tomorrow. We’ll be back here with further progress and news. But if I could just say to every American, we’ll get through this. We’ll get through this, but we’ll get through this together. Every American needs to understand that whether you are in an area that’s impacted by the coronavirus, or an area where there’s very few cases, if you do your part to put into practice 15 days to slow the spread, you will do just that. You’ll impact the spread of this coronavirus epidemic in our country. These experts tell me that we can significantly reduce the number of Americans that would be exposed to the coronavirus as every American continues to put these guidelines into practice."
2020-03-25,01:13:03,Mike Pence,"And we just know that with all of the extraordinary effort that’s being done at the federal level by this tremendous team, and all of our agencies, all the great leadership by governors in both parties across the country, with all the incredible and courageous work by healthcare workers, with the cooperation and the prayers of the American people, we will get this done. We will not only slow the spread, we’ll protect the vulnerable, and we’ll heal our land. Thank you all. We’ll see you tomorrow. [Inaudible 01:13:34]"
2020-03-26,00:15,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful day. Very good, what you’re doing, look at all those empty seats. Never seen it like that. Oh, boy. Oh, how the world has changed. How the world has changed, right? But it’s going to end up being better than ever. I want to thank you very much for being here and I’d like to update you on the steps we’re taking on our ongoing fight to defeat the virus. This morning at 7:55 AM, I spoke to the leaders of the G20, had a great meeting and we have a lot of different ideas, a lot of good ideas, we’re working together. The leaders gathered virtually around the world to discuss the whole subject of the problem that right now a 151 nations have got. We had President Alberto Fernandez of Argentina, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, President Xi of China, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Modi of India, President Widodo of Indonesia, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan."
2020-03-26,01:52,Donald Trump,"Congratulations to Japan, on making a great decision on the Olympics, going to make it next year, 2021. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico. I want to thank the President of Mexico for having done such a great job with respect to the military. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border and very few people are getting through, I can tell you that. We got to keep it that way. And we have a great relationship with Mexico now. President Putin of Russia, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, President Ramaphosa of South Africa, President Moon of, as you know, a country that we spend a lot of time in, South Korea. We’re working very hard on that. Prime Minister Sanchez of Spain, President Erdogan of Turkey, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Council Charles Michel, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom, World Bank President David Malpass, and the International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva."
2020-03-26,03:35,Donald Trump,"So that’s a big group, but it’s a great group, and they were all there, every one of them. And we talked about the problem and hopefully it won’t be a problem for too much longer. The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts. We discussed how vitally important it is for all of our nations to immediately share information and data. And we’ve been doing that to a large extent, but we’ll do it even more so, and to inform our, I guess you could say inform each of us on the fight that we’ve got going one way or the other, it’s a little bit different, but we’re handling it a little bit in different ways. But there is great uniformity I think, we had a… it was a terrific meeting, tremendous spirit among all of those countries. You had 20 countries plus the other people that I mentioned, and a tremendous spirit to get this over with."
2020-03-26,04:33,Donald Trump,"After the meeting with the world leaders, I spoke with the governors of our 50 states and territories. Our team as a been in constant communication with the governors and we had a terrific meeting. Somebody in the fake news said that one of the governors said, “Oh, we need Tom Brady.” I said, “Yeah, he meant that in a positive way.” He said, “We need Tom Brady.” We’re going to do great and he meant it very positively, but they took it differently. They think Tom Brady should be leading the effort. That’s only fake news, and I like Tom Brady, spoke to him the other day. He’s a great guy. But I wish the news could be real, I wish it could be honest, I wish it weren’t corrupt, but so much of it is. It’s so sad to see. Just so sad to see. We had a great meeting. I’ll tell you what, I’m sure you have tapes of the meeting. I’m sure that you were able to get tapes, very easily see it 50 governors plus."
2020-03-26,05:34,Donald Trump,"And if you had tapes you’d see it was really, I mean, there was no contention, I would say virtually none. I would say maybe one person that was a little tiny bit of a raising of a voice, a little wise guy a little bit, but he’s usually a big wise guy, not so much anymore. We saw to it that he wouldn’t be so much anymore, but he is… we had a… I mean I would rate, Mike was there, a lot of the folks in the back were there, and it was a great meeting. Took place at about 12 o’clock. So we went from the G20 to the governors, we also spoke about the economic relief with the governors and the package that we’re moving through Congress to deliver much needed financial assistance to hardworking families and small businesses. I want to thank the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate for unanimously passing the largest financial relief package in American history, 96 to zero, and I have to say it’s the largest by far. And I’m profoundly grateful that both parties came together to provide relief for American workers and families in this hour of need."
2020-03-26,06:48,Donald Trump,"The House of Representatives must now pass this bill, hopefully without delay. I think it’s got tremendous support when you’re at 96 to nothing. And, as you know, a couple of those people are quarantined and one, Ryan Paul, he’s actually got it, but he’ll be better. He’s been a great guy. He’s been a great friend of mine actually. The massive $2.2 trillion relief package includes job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that keep their workers on the payroll, it’s pretty good. Loan forgiveness, keep the workers on the payroll, it’s pretty good. Direct cash payments will be available to American citizens earning less than $99,000 per year. $3,400 for the typical family of four. Expanded unemployment benefits, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months."
2020-03-26,07:50,Donald Trump,"These are things that, by the way, we have plenty more to go and, but there are things that nobody’s ever had any package like this done, and I just want to thank them. Hopefully it’ll get approved equally easily in the House. Really, I think it will go through pretty well from what I hear. Virtually everybody, there could be one vote, one vote, one grand stander maybe, you might have one grand stander. And for that we’ll have to come back and take a little more time, and it’ll pass, it’ll just take a little longer. But let’s see whether or not we have a grand stander. Critical support for the hardest hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks and tough new safeguards to prevent executive compensation abuse. Over $100 billion for our amazing doctors, nurses and hospitals, $45 billion for the disaster relief fund, more than doubling the amount available, this is tremendous stuff. $27 billion for the coronavirus response, including $16 billion to build up the strategic national stockpile, with critical supplies, including masks, respirators, and all sorts of pharmaceuticals."
2020-03-26,09:07,Donald Trump,"$3.5 billion to expand assistance to childcare providers and childcare, the benefits to healthcare workers, first responders and others on the front lines of the crisis, and these are really brave, incredible people I have to say. And some of them are getting sick, and some of them are getting very sick, and some of them don’t even recover. They’re incredible people. $1 billion for Defense Production Act procurement. We are, as you know, using the act, but we use it only when necessary. We use it as leverage, we generally don’t have to use it to accomplish what we want to accomplish. As of today, FEMA has shipped over 9 million n95 masks, 20 million face masks, 3.1 million face shields, nearly 6,000 ventilators, 2.6 million gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and we’re sending more every day and we’ve got tremendous amounts of equipment coming in. A lot of great companies are making equipment right now. The ventilators, obviously they take a little longer to make, but we have a lot of companies making them and we’re going to be in great shape."
2020-03-26,10:20,Donald Trump,"We took over an empty shelf. We took over a very depleted place in a lot of ways. As you know, the testing is going very, very well, and that was obsolete and broken and we fixed it, and it’s been going really good. And I think very importantly, the stockpile, we’re really filling it up and we fill it up rapidly. But we get it out, sometimes we have it sent directly to the states instead. And again, the state has to be doing this kind of a thing also. We’re sort of a… we look from behind a little bit and we look at how are they doing and if they need help, we do it, but it’s their first responsibility. Sometimes they just can’t get it, but we load it up and we send it out, but if we can, we have it sent directly to the state. We want it to go directly to the point where we want it."
2020-03-26,11:12,Donald Trump,"I can now announce something that I think is incredible, what they’ve done in the Navy, because the incredible Naval hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, which is incredible actually when you see it inside, will be underway to New York city on Saturday. So it’s going to be leaving on Saturday rather than three weeks from now. They did the maintenance quickly and it was going to be there for quite a while longer, another three or four weeks, and it should be arriving. I told the governor 20 minutes ago, Governor Cuomo, that the ship will be arriving at New York Harbor on Monday. I think I’m going to go out and I’ll kiss it goodbye. I’ll go to, it’s in Virginia as you know, and I will go and we’ll be waving together, because I suspect the media will be following. Johnny, you going to be following? Maybe, you never know, huh?"
2020-03-26,12:14,Johnny,"I have concerns, a very important vessel."
2020-03-26,12:14,Donald Trump,"It’s a great chip. It’s a great vessel, that’s right. So if you want to go, I’ll see you there, and if you don’t, that’s okay. After being fully loaded with medical supplies, it’s going to be, it’s loaded up to the top and it’s over at the Norfolk Naval Base, that’s where it departs. It is expected then to, I mean we’re saving about three to four weeks by the incredible work done by the Navy, and I actually look forward to Saturday to see it go. The ship will arrive and I believe it’s going to get a little bit of a ceremony. There’s something very beautiful about it. It’s an incredible piece of work. Going to be landing at Pier 90 in Manhattan to provide hospital surge capacity for the New York metropolitan area, so it’s a surge capacity. They may use it for this or they may have other people coming in from hospitals unrelated to the virus and then they’ll use those hospitals on land, they’ll use those hospital for the virus, but we’ll see how they do it. They could do it either way, one way or the other, whichever one is best."
2020-03-26,13:22,Donald Trump,"But it could be, because it’s set up so well for a regular hospital, that they may take people out of hospitals and then use those rooms for the virus. The National Institute of Health and the private sector, working closely with the FDA, continue to collaborate to discover and test treatments and therapies that can effectively reduce the duration and symptoms of the virus and help, very much help, people to recover. And I’m firmly committed to bringing these treatments to market very quickly. We have a lot of tests going on with regard to different medicines, and I hope we get lucky. I hope we hit… a lot of talented scientists and doctors are working on therapeutics, a cure, vaccines. I think we’re doing very well. Tony may speak to that a little bit later, but I think we’re doing very well with regard to the vaccines. I think we’re doing well with regard to a lot of the things I just mentioned, but we’ll have to see what happens. We’re going to know fairly soon about a lot of them."
2020-03-26,14:27,Donald Trump,"But it’s very advanced and the vaccines are very advanced prior to, as you know, a fairly reasonably long test period of, in that case, over a year. Every American should be proud of the incredible spirit our country has brought to this effort. It’s been incredible. Citizens from all walks of life have come together to turn the tide in this battle. We’re witnessing the extraordinary of American unity like a lot of people have never seen, even getting a vote. You’re talking about trillions of dollars and you get to a vote of 96 to nothing. We are waging war on this virus using every financial, scientific, medical, pharmaceutical and military resource to halt it’s spread and protect our citizens. I want to express our tremendous thanks to the American people for continuing to practice social distancing like you people are practicing right here. I don’t know, this room may never be the same. Maintaining good hygiene and follow government guidelines. Vice President Pence lifts up that card every time, and it’s not very complicated, but hopefully you can do that. And your commitment will make all the difference in the world, and that’s one of the big ones will be for awhile, stay home. Just relax, stay home. Making a lot of progress as we continue to gather more information and accelerate the testing where we’re doing record numbers of tests now, far more than any other country has done. I told you yesterday, eight days here, because you heard so much about South Korea, the media kept of themself, South Korea, South Korea, we have a great relationship with president Moon and South Korea. But when I hear so much about South Korea, so in eight days we do more testing than they did in eight weeks, and it’s a very highly sophisticated test. We’ll be able to deploy even more data-driven and targeted approaches to slow the… ultimately it’s a very devastating thing, but we will vanquish this virus, and a lot of progress has been made."
2020-03-26,16:44,Donald Trump,"That’s why earlier today I sent a letter to Americas governors describing how we will be using the data to update existing guidance on social distancing, which will be developed in close coordination with our nation’s public health officials and scientists. Because of the sacrifices of our great doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals, the brilliance of our scientists and researchers, and the goodness and generosity of our people, I know that we will achieve victory and quickly return to the path of exceptional health, safety and prosperity for all of our citizens."
2020-03-26,17:20,Donald Trump,"We have to get back to work. Our people want to work, they want to go back. They have to go back and we’re going to be talking about dates, we’re going to be talking with a lot of great professionals. But this is a country that was built on getting it done and our people want to go back to work. I’m hearing it loud and clear from everybody, so we’ll see what happens. We’re going to have a lot more information early next week and we’ll be reporting that back, but I just want to leave it with you, we have to go back. This is the United States of America, they don’t want to sit around and wait and there’ll be practicing. And by the way, a lot of people-"
2020-03-26,18:03,Donald Trump,"And then wait and there’ll be practicing. And by the way, a lot of people misinterpret when I say go back. They’re going to be practicing, as much as you can, social distancing and washing your hands and not shaking hands, and all of the things that we talk about so much. But they have to go back to work. Our country has to go back. Our country is based on that. And I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly. I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly. A lot of progress is made, but we got to go back to work."
2020-03-26,18:32,Donald Trump,"We may take sections of our country, we may take large sections of our country that aren’t so seriously affected and we may do it that way, but we’ve got to start the process pretty soon. So we’ll be talking to you a little bit more about that next week. And with that, if you have any questions you could ask. And then I’m going to have vice president stay behind and he’s going to take questions and also introduce some of the people. You can ask them some questions. John, please."
2020-03-26,19:02,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, unemployment numbers out today, 3.3 million. I take it, not a surprise?"
2020-03-26,19:07,Donald Trump,"No, not at all."
2020-03-26,19:11,John (Reporter),But still a staggering number. I wonder about your perspective on that.
2020-03-26,19:14,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s a nobody’s fault, certainly not in this country. Nobody’s fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China at a very early date. I say that because some people don’t want to accept it, but this was a great decision made by our country. Or the numbers that you’re talking about, we’re a big country, they’d be far greater, far, far bigger."
2020-03-26,19:41,Donald Trump,"So when I heard the number, I mean, I heard it could be six million, could be seven million. It’s 3.3 or 3.2, but it’s a lot of jobs. But I think we’ll come back very strong. The sooner we get back to work, every day that we stay out, it gets harder to bring it back very quickly. And our people don’t want to stay out. So I know those numbers, John, but I think you’ll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the hidden enemy, as I say, it’s a hidden enemy. Sometimes a hidden enemy is a lot tougher than somebody that stares you in the face, right? So we’ll see what happens. But, I mean, they’re fully expected numbers, at least. I mean, at least. Steve, please."
2020-03-26,20:22,Steve (Reporter),"The U.S. proposal to deploy some troops along the Canadian border, Prime Minister Trudeau is complaining about that. Why is that necessary?"
2020-03-26,20:31,Donald Trump,"Well, we have very strong deployments on the Southern border, as you know, with Mexico. And we had some troops up in Canada, but I’ll find out about that. I guess it’s equal justice to a certain extent. But in Canada, we do have troops along the border. We have a lot of things coming in from Canada. We have trade, some illegal trade that we don’t like. We have very strong sanctions on some, we have very strong tariffs on dumping steel."
2020-03-26,21:04,Donald Trump,"And we don’t like steel coming through our border that’s been dumped in Canada so they could avoid the tariff. I charge a lot of tariff for the steel, and it’s been great for our steel companies because now they can really go. You look at what’s happened with steel, it’s been pretty incredible. But we’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs on steel, and much of it comes in from China, but they can come through the Canadian border too, so we’re always watching for that."
2020-03-26,21:28,Steve (Reporter),"If I’m reading the numbers correctly, the United States now has surpassed China as the country with the highest number of virus cases. Does this surprise you at all? Is it following a predictable trajectory?"
2020-03-26,21:41,Donald Trump,"No, I think it’s a tribute to our testing. Number one, you don’t know what the numbers are in China. China tells you numbers and … I’m speaking to President Xi tonight. I believe that we’ll have a good conversation, I’m sure. But you just don’t know. What are the numbers?"
2020-03-26,21:57,Donald Trump,"But I think it’s a tribute to the testing. We’re testing tremendous numbers of people and every day, the way the system works, and I want to thank especially, Roche has been fantastic, a great company. They’ve done a tremendous amount … Deborah was telling me before that they were really, they’ve really stepped up to the plate and done great, as have other of the companies. But it seems that they’re really doing it particularly well. So we’ll see what happens there. But it’s a tribute to the amount of testing that we’re doing. We’re doing tremendous testing. And I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing, and I think that’s a little hard."
2020-03-26,22:33,Unnamed,"Mr. President, on the 3.3 jobless claims, you just suggested it could be six to seven million. A lot of those workers-"
2020-03-26,22:40,Donald Trump,"No, I didn’t say that. No, you’re wrong. I didn’t say that. I said some people were projecting that it would be six or seven and it’s, I believe, 3.3."
2020-03-26,22:48,Unnamed,"It came it at 3.3. Millions of Americans out of work, some of them will be losing their insurance. What’s your plan to make sure, through no fault of your own, as you just mentioned, that they stay insured? Are you willing to plus up the subsidies for some of the exchanges under Obamacare, expand Medicaid? What’s being considered?"
2020-03-26,23:05,Donald Trump,"I mean, the things I just read to you are being considered and other things are being considered. People are going to be getting big checks and it’s not their fault. What happened to them is not their fault."
2020-03-26,23:16,Unnamed,But for their health-
2020-03-26,23:16,Donald Trump,"So we’re doing a lot of different things on health insurance. We have meetings on it today. We’re taking care of our people. This is not their fault what happened, and we’re taking care of … We’re starting off by sending them very big checks. I think for a family of four, it’s about $3,000. And we’re taking care of our people, we’re taking care of our workers. As I say, this was not a financial crisis. This was a health crisis, a medical crisis. We’re going to take care of our people. Please. Yeah."
2020-03-26,23:44,Unnamed,The National Restaurant Association came out with the survey this morning saying that 3% of all restaurants in this country have shuttered for good in the past three weeks. And the projection is that 11% more are going to close in the next 30 days. So what do you say to a restaurant owner who is looking at his sheets and thinks he has to close within the next 30 days?
2020-03-26,24:15,Donald Trump,"Well, I hate to … I know the business very well. I understand the restaurant business is a very delicate business. It’s a business that is not easy. I always say, in a restaurant business, you can serve 30 great meals to a person or a family and they love it. One bad meal, number 31, they never come back again. It’s a very tough business, but they’re great people that run restaurants."
2020-03-26,24:39,Donald Trump,"And I’ve heard 3% could be lost and you could go as high as 10 or 11%, but they’ll all come back in one form or another. It might be a different restaurant, but it’s going to be a great business for a lot of people. And we’re making it easy for people to … Look, what we’re doing in terms of loans, what we’re doing in terms of salaries, they’ll all come back. It may not be the same restaurant, may not be the same ownership, but they’ll all be back. Yes, sir. Please."
2020-03-26,25:05,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you mentioned the pledges from American companies to provide supplies, but as we top 81,000 cases in the U.S., does it make sense to re-look at using the Defense Production Act?"
2020-03-26,25:19,Donald Trump,"Well, I talked about the Defense Production Act a lot and I’ve enacted it. I have it. I can do it with a pen. And we have actually used it on two minor occasions, and then we could withdraw it. But for the most part, the companies, we don’t need it. We say we need this and they say, don’t bother, we’re going to do it."
2020-03-26,25:39,Donald Trump,"I mean, we’re dealing with Ford, General Motors, 3M. We’re dealing with great companies. They want to do this, they want to do this. They’re doing things that, frankly, they don’t need somebody to walk over there with a hammer and say, do it. They are getting it done. They’re making tremendous amounts of equipment, tremendous amounts. And when this is over, we’re going to be fully stockpiled, which they would have never been except for a circumstance."
2020-03-26,26:05,Donald Trump,"This was something that nobody has ever thought could happen to this country. I’m not even blaming … Look, we inherited a broken situation, but I don’t totally blame the people that were before me and this administration. Nobody would’ve ever thought a thing like this could have happened. But the production act, Defense Production Act is a wonderful thing, but I just haven’t had to use it. They know it’s activated. They know I can use it. Maybe that frightens them a little bit. It’s got tremendous power, but I haven’t had to. Please."
2020-03-26,26:35,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. A question for me and then another question, if you’ll let me, for some of my colleagues who are social distancing."
2020-03-26,26:43,Donald Trump,Where are they? They were all outside trying to get in. I know.
2020-03-26,26:46,Unnamed,"The first question has to do with a cruise liners like Carnival and Royal Caribbean. They want this relief aid, but they’re worried because they offshored to places like Panama and Liberia, they might not qualify. Senator Holley has said that they should move back to the United States before they get a check. Do you agree? Should they pay U.S. taxes to get U.S. taxpayer relief?"
2020-03-26,27:10,Donald Trump,"So I’m a big fan of Senator Holley and I also like the idea. There were some senators that didn’t want to do anything like Carnival, great company, but they’re based in different places. I won’t tell you why. I could tell you exactly where they’re based, but I won’t do that. But they’re based in actually more than one places, as ships are registered in different locations."
2020-03-26,27:33,Donald Trump,"I do like the concept of perhaps coming in and registering here, coming into the United States. It’s very tough to make a loan to a company when they’re based in a different country, but with that being said, they have thousands and thousands of people that work there, and maybe almost as importantly, that work on shore filling these ships with goods and products. And the cruise line business is very important. And I know Carnival, what a great job they do, Micky Arison. And I would think that we could stick with Senator Holley and maybe really look at that very seriously."
2020-03-26,28:11,Donald Trump,"Look, it’s a big business, it’s a great business. It’s a business that employs tremendous number of people outside of the ship itself. I mean, you look at these ports, it’s loaded up with shops and people that are involved with the ship. So we’re going to work very hard on the cruise line business and we’re going to try and work something out, but I like the concept. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-03-26,28:32,Unnamed,"The second one. Thank you, sir. The Senate bill includes aid that’s directly tied to the airlines and since before the pandemic, Boeing was already suffering from the losses of 737 MAX airplanes. Do you think it’s appropriate to use this legislation to provide them with $17 billion of aid on top of 25 billion that they could qualify for as a passenger airline, and then another four billion that they could qualify for as a cargo airline? Is that fair?"
2020-03-26,29:05,Donald Trump,"So the airline business is a very tough business, over many years. It’s been very, very tough. It’s got everything. It’s got labor, it’s got very strong, powerful … You look at the cost of these airliners. Everything is tough. Very highly technological, you look at how complicated, how complex. It’s got unions, it’s got everything. The airline business, generally speaking, it’s a very tough business, always been a very tough business."
2020-03-26,29:32,Donald Trump,"With that being said, we have to keep our airlines going. And we’re going to be using some … Now maybe we’ll take a piece of the airlines for the country, for our country, where we loan money and we take a piece. It’s all fully ready, we’re ready to go. But if we didn’t do that, we’d end up with no airlines and we can’t do that. The airline business is very vital to our country. It’s a tough business. We have to understand that. I mean, I could tell you other businesses that are different kinds of business, they are very good businesses, but airlines have always been very, very tough. Please. No, please. Yeah, I didn’t call you, I called this gentleman."
2020-03-26,30:09,Unnamed,Thank you. Thanks a lot. On Monday-
2020-03-26,30:11,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-03-26,30:12,Unnamed,Did you speak with-
2020-03-26,30:12,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-03-26,30:13,Unnamed,I’m with Bloomberg.
2020-03-26,30:14,Donald Trump,"Yeah, Bloomberg."
2020-03-26,30:15,Unnamed,Mario Partners.
2020-03-26,30:16,Donald Trump,How’s Michael? Doing good?
2020-03-26,30:19,Unnamed,"Mr. President, on Monday, did you speak with Chinese President Xi before you urged Americans to not blame Asian Americans for the coronavirus? We noticed that you’ve backed off of that language. I know you’re speaking with him again tonight."
2020-03-26,30:35,Donald Trump,"No, I didn’t. I’m speaking to him tonight. It’s scheduled to go tonight. I’ll have a call with President Xi of China. A very good relationship. No, I didn’t like when they came up, and it wasn’t him. Somebody at a lower level, mid level, we found out pretty much. But they made a statement that our soldiers brought it into China. No, it came from China."
2020-03-26,30:57,Donald Trump,"And we just signed a very big deal with China. They’re paying us a lot of money in tariffs and other things. They never paid us 25 cents. Look, China has taken advantage of the United States, until I came here, with sleepy Joe Biden and Obama and Bush and everybody else. I’m not blaming them, I’m blaming everybody. They were allowed to, $500 billion a year they were taking out. We had trade deficits that were so large, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, and we’ve changed it."
2020-03-26,31:30,Donald Trump,"Look, now we’re taking in billions of dollars and we gave some to our farmers, because China, they targeted our farmers. And our farmers are very happy and our farmers got through a very rough period because of what I was able to do. Took the money from China and gave it to the farmers and we had plenty of leftover after that. Now we’re going into a phase two negotiation with China, but we’re getting 25% on $250 billion, and then we’re getting a lot on money after that."
2020-03-26,31:59,Donald Trump,"So we’ve never had to deal with China. China took advantage of the United States. And you know what? I don’t blame China for that. I blame the people that were right here, because they should have never allowed it to happen. But the relationship with China has been a very good one. John?"
2020-03-26,32:15,Unnamed,"Mr. President, did President Xi ask you to calm that language down or to not use that language?"
2020-03-26,32:20,Donald Trump,"He never asked me to calm it down, no. Somebody might’ve spoken to somebody, but nobody spoke to me about it. I think it was time though, because I talk about the Chinese virus, and I mean it. That’s where it came from. If you look at Ebola, if you look at all … lyme, right? Lyme, Connecticut. You look at all these different horrible diseases, they seem to come with the name, with the location. And this was the Chinese virus. But I don’t have to say it if they feel so strongly about it. We’ll see."
2020-03-26,32:53,Donald Trump,"But we just made a great deal with China. Great, hopefully, for both parties. But we’ve made a deal with China and we’re going to do another one it looks like. They want to do it very badly. Maybe they’ll want to wait, like Iran. They want to wait to see whether or not Trump gets beaten in the election, because would they love to negotiate with Biden or somebody else other than me. They would love it. That’s their best dream in the world. So many others. So there are some that maybe are waiting until after November 3rd, the election day."
2020-03-26,33:23,Donald Trump,"But I think we’re doing very well. It would be sad if we blew all of the advantages that we have right now, because we’ve made unbelievable trade deals. Whether it’s Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, and others, we have changed the whole thing around. Please."
2020-03-26,33:41,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, earlier today you sent a notification letter to the nation’s governors saying that you will soon come out with new guidelines about social distancing and other items. Do you have any data yet to suggest which specific areas of the country may have their guidelines relaxed, which areas of the country may have their guidelines tightened?"
2020-03-26,34:00,Donald Trump,"I think Deborah will talk to you about that, and Tony in a few minutes. But I think we’ll start talking about that, because we have to open up. We can’t say, let’s close. People don’t want to close, John. I say it again and again. The reason I do, because I want you to report it eventually. Go ahead, Steve."
2020-03-26,34:15,Unnamed,How would that work without widespread testing done to-
2020-03-26,34:16,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, Steve."
2020-03-26,34:19,Steve (Reporter),"From President Xi tonight, what do you want to talk to him about?"
2020-03-26,34:22,Donald Trump,"Yeah, it’s his call. I mean, I’ll talk to him, whatever he wants to … We’ll have, I think, a very fruitful call, have a good call tonight at nine o’clock. Please."
2020-03-26,34:32,Steve (Reporter),Is it about the virus [inaudible 00:34:34]?
2020-03-26,34:33,Donald Trump,"We’ll be talking about that. Yeah, we’ll be talking about the virus. In the back first, please."
2020-03-26,34:40,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Despite the jobless claim numbers today, the market rallied again. It’s up over 4,000 points the last three days."
2020-03-26,34:46,Donald Trump,"Yeah, record."
2020-03-26,34:48,Unnamed,"The largest charge since 1931. Do you think that the economic uncertainty has passed, in the market?"
2020-03-26,34:55,Donald Trump,"No, not yet. It hasn’t passed, but it’s come a long way. I think they think we’re doing a really good job in terms of running this whole situation having to do with the virus. I think they feel the administration, myself and the administration, are doing a good job of keeping very important people informed. Because it was a great fear and a lot of good things are happening."
2020-03-26,35:22,Donald Trump,"The mortality rate is at a, in my opinion, you’ll have to speak to Deborah, Tony, all of the others, but in my opinion, it’s way, way down and that takes a lot of fear out. It’s one thing to have it, it’s another thing to die. When I first got involved, I was being told numbers that were much, much higher than the number that seems to be. And remember that people that have it … many people have it. I just spoke to two people, they had it. They never went to a doctor. They had it, absolutely had it, but they never went to a doctor. They never went to any of that. They didn’t report it. You have thousands and hundreds of thousands of cases like that, so you have to add that to the-"
2020-03-26,36:03,Donald Trump,"… hundreds of thousands of cases like that, so you have to add that to the case load also. And the people that actually die, that percentage is a much lower percentage than I ever thought. That’s one of the reasons I say, look, we’re going to beat this and we’re going to get back to work."
2020-03-26,36:16,Unnamed,I have one more question-
2020-03-26,36:17,Donald Trump,"Yes, please."
2020-03-26,36:18,Unnamed,"… on more news from the administration today, the DOJ announced charges against Nicolas Maduro for drug trafficking. They designated him as a narcoterrorist."
2020-03-26,36:25,Donald Trump,Sounds appropriate.
2020-03-26,36:27,Unnamed,It’s also expected that Venezuela is going to get hit really hard by the coronavirus. Does the administration see this as a weak point for the Maduro regime?
2020-03-26,36:35,Donald Trump,"Well, no. No, we don’t look at a weak point. This is a serious problem for over 150 nations, the virus. I would say this. Maduro and Venezuela, we’re watching it very closely. We’ll see what happens. But that is correct. Those charges were made. Please."
2020-03-26,36:50,Unnamed,You said a moment ago that you used the Defense Production Act on two minor occasions. What were those?
2020-03-26,36:55,Donald Trump,We will give you that notification. We’ll let you know.
2020-03-26,36:57,Unnamed,Can I follow up on John’s question about the classifying for counties? A lot of these areas have not done testing yet. Is it safe to say that the current guidelines will be extended into next week? Will you wait to change those guidelines until you have the data [crosstalk 00:01:23]?
2020-03-26,37:23,Donald Trump,"I want those guidelines to go even when we’re open and fully operational, and frankly, much of the guidelines like shaking hands, maybe people aren’t going to be shaking hands anymore. Tony had mentioned to me, Tony Fauci, the other day that I don’t think he would be too upset with the concept of not shaking hands. He was saying that the flu would cut down, the regular flu would be cut down by quite a bit if we didn’t do that, if we didn’t shake hands. Even the regular flu, of which we have a lot of deaths and a lot of problems with that too. So I think a lot of great things are going to… When we’re open, as soon as we open, that doesn’t mean you’re going to stop with the guidelines. You’ll still try and distance yourself, maybe not to the same extent because you have to lead a life. But I think the time is coming. How about one more question? Go ahead, in the back."
2020-03-26,38:13,Unnamed,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. I also have two questions because I’m asking on behalf of foreign press as well. So one domestic question, one international. Domestically, you just tweeted the other day saying that it’s very important that we totally protect Asian Americans."
2020-03-26,38:31,Donald Trump,"Yes, I do. Very important to me."
2020-03-26,38:33,Unnamed,But still millions-
2020-03-26,38:34,Donald Trump,"Very important to me. We have to protect our Asian Americans. It’s very important, that was a very important tweet to me because I didn’t like things that I was hearing. Please go ahead."
2020-03-26,38:43,Unnamed,"Well, what’s the concrete measure that you’ll take to combat the hate crimes against the Asians?"
2020-03-26,38:48,Donald Trump,"Well I don’t know. All I know is this. Asian Americans in our country are doing fantastically well. I’m very close to them as you know, and they’re doing fantastically well. And I think they appreciate the job we’re doing, but I did want to put that statement out, the social media statement, because to me Asian Americans are a great part of our country. Thank you all very much. We’ll see you soon. Thank you."
2020-03-26,52:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"There are a large group of people who are asymptomatic, who have never presented for any test. In order to have the kind of numbers that were predicted, to get to 60 million people infected or have six million people infected, you have to have a large group of asymptomatics. Because in no country to date have we seen an attack rate over one in a thousand. So either we’re only measuring the tip of the iceberg of the symptomatic cases, and underneath it are a large group of people. So we’re working very hard to get that antibody test because that’s a good way to figure out who are all these people under here and do they exist? Or we have the transmission completely wrong. So these are the things we’re looking at because the predictions of the models don’t match the reality on the ground in either China, South Korea or Italy. We are about five times the size of Italy."
2020-03-26,53:11,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So if we were Italy and you did all those divisions, Italy should have close to 400,000 deaths. They’re not close to achieving that. So these are the kinds of things we’re trying to understand. Models are models. We’re adapting now to the react… There’s enough data now of the real experience with the coronavirus on the ground to really make these predictions much more sound. So when people start talking about 20% of a population getting infected, it’s very scary. But we don’t have data that matches that based on the experience. And then finally, the situation about ventilators, we were reassured in meeting with our colleagues in New York that there are still ICU beds remaining, and there’s still significant, over a 1,000 or 2,000 ventilators, that have not been utilized yet."
2020-03-26,54:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Please, for the reassurance of people around the world, to wake up this morning and look at people talking about creating DNR situations, do not resuscitate situations for patients. There is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion. You can be thinking about it in a hospital. Certainly many hospitals talk about this on a daily basis, but to say that to the American people… to make the implication that when they need a hospital bed, it’s not going to be there, or when they need that ventilator, it’s not going to be there. We don’t have an evidence of that right now, and it’s our job collectively to assure the American people that… it’s our collective job to make sure that doesn’t happen."
2020-03-26,54:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Right now, you can see these cases are concentrated in highly urban areas. There are other parts of the states that have lots of ventilators and other parts of New York state that don’t have any infections right now, so we can be creative, we can meet the need by being responsive, but there is no model right now… I mean, no reality on the ground where we can see that 60 to 70% of Americans are going to get infected in the next eight to 12 weeks. I just want to be clear about that."
2020-03-26,55:22,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, we’re adapting to the reality on the ground. We’re looking at the models of how they can inform, but we also are learning very clearly from South Korea and from Italy and from Spain. Just a final, because I know many of you will look up my numbers… the only people who are over really one in a thousand cases are people that have very small populations like Monaco and Lichtenstein, so you will see a different number coming from when your population is really tiny; one case can put you over one to a thousand or two to a thousand. Thank you."
2020-03-26,55:59,Mike Pence,We’ll do questions involving Dr. Fauci.
2020-03-26,56:02,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I’m going to change the topic just a little bit because there was the questions that came up and I had been asked about this on a couple of media interactions regarding the interventions that we’re talking about. And it’s important because it’s about something that I said yesterday, about what we would likely see… whenever you put the clamps down and shut things down, you do it for two reasons: you do it to prevent the further spread; this we call mitigation, but are you also do it to buy yourself time to get better prepared for what might be a rebound. It may be a rebound that we get things really under control and then you pull back, which ultimately we’re going to have to do. Everybody in the world is going to have to do that. You’re either going to get a rebound or it might cycle into the next season."
2020-03-26,56:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So, what are we going to do to prepare ourselves for that? One of the most important things is one that I mentioned several times from this podium, and that is to clarify a bit about the timeline for vaccines, and would that have any real impact on what we would call the rebound, or what we would call a cycling in the season?"
2020-03-26,57:06,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Certainly, for sure, a vaccine is not going to help us now, next month, the month after. But as I mentioned to you, we went into a phase one trial, and I keep referring to one vaccine; there’s more than one. There’s a couple of handfuls of vaccines at different stages of development, but they’re all following the same course, and the course is, you first go in to a phase one trial to see if it’s safe, and you have very few people, 45 people within a certain age group: all healthy, none at really any great risk of getting infected."
2020-03-26,57:39,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And the reason you do that… because you want to make sure that it’s safe. Then the next thing you do… and that takes about three months easily, maybe more; so that’s going to bring us into the beginning or middle of the summer. Then you go to a phase two trial or what we say two-three, which means we’re going to put a lot of people in there. Now, we hope that there aren’t a lot of people getting infected, but it is likely there will be somewhere in the world where that’s going on, so it’s likely that we will get what’s called an efficacy signal, and we will know whether or not it actually works."
2020-03-26,58:11,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"If, in fact, it does, we hope to rush it to be able to have some impact on re-cycling in the next season, and like I said, that could be a year to a year and a half. I’m not changing any of the dates that I mentioned. But one of the things that we are going to do that you need to understand, that has been a stumbling block for previous development of vaccines, and that is… even before you know something works, at risk, you have to start producing it because once you know it works, you can’t say, “Great, it works. Now give me another six months to produce it.” So we’re working with a variety of companies to take that risk. We didn’t take it with Zika. That’s why we have a nice Zika vaccine, but we don’t have enough to do it because there’s no Zika around; same with SARS. So that’s one of the things we’re really going to push on, is to be able to have it ready if, in fact, it works."
2020-03-26,59:06,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Now, the issue of safety… something that I want to make sure the American public understand. It’s not only safety. When you inject somebody and they get maybe an idiosyncratic reaction, they get a little allergic reaction, or they get pain. There’s safety associated… does the vaccine make you worse? And there are diseases in which you vaccinate someone, they get infected with what you’re trying to protect them with, and you actually enhance the infection. You can get a good feel for that in animal models. So, that’s going to be interspersed at the same time that we’re testing. We’re going to try and make sure we don’t have enhancement. It’s the worst possible thing you could do, is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse."
2020-03-26,59:51,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Next. And finally, with regard… I’ll get you to your question. Finally with regard to therapies… I mean, we keep getting asked about therapies. There’s a whole menu of therapies that are going into clinical trial. As I’ve told you all on a repeated… again, the best way to get the best drug as quickly as possible is to do a randomized controlled trial so that you know, is it safe and is it effective? If it’s not effective, get it off the board and go to the next thing. If it is effective, get it out to the people that need it. So, you’re going to be hearing over the next month or more about different drugs that are going to go into these randomized controlled trials. And I feel confident knowing about what this virus is and what we can do with it, that we will have some sort of therapy that will give at least a partial, if not a very good protection, in preventing progression of disease. And we’ll be back here talking about that a lot, I’m sure. Thank you"
2020-03-26,01:00:48,Mike Pence,"Tony, you can take a question. Go ahead."
2020-03-26,01:00:51,John (Reporter),"If I could just get back to what you’re saying about this idea of risk and drug manufacturer. Are you saying that at some point in the phase two trials, that if you’re seeing some form of efficacy, that you may try to convince a laboratory to school up production at that point so that there’s a reason-"
2020-03-26,01:01:06,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Even before, even before. When I go into phase two, I’m going to find somebody that’s going to make it."
2020-03-26,01:01:11,John (Reporter),[crosstalk 01:01:10].
2020-03-26,01:01:14,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Partially the federal government, I think in some respects, to de-risk it, but also investments by the companies. A lot of companies are not shy now about doing that. Usually when you do that at risk, John, you’ve got to give some backup for them, and we’ve done that. We’ve put hundreds of millions of dollars into companies to try and make vaccines. I wouldn’t hesitate to do that for a moment, now"
2020-03-26,01:01:33,Unnamed,"On the county issue, let’s talk about having low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk counties… Dr. Birx, but there’s no domestic travel restrictions. What’s to prevent somebody from a high-risk county going to a low-risk county? Don’t you risk creating a patchwork system, allowing more cases to slip through the cracks and the virus to spread in other areas of the country?"
2020-03-26,01:01:56,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think this is a very important concept and it’s why we’ve really worked on messaging to the American people about these 15 days to stop the spread, because part of this will be the need to have highly responsible behavior between counties, and I think the American people can understand that, that they will understand where the virus is, because we’ll have the testing data and where it isn’t, and make sure that they’re taking appropriate precautions as they move in and out of spaces. I think this will be critical for our future as we work together to really understand where the virus is and where it isn’t in real time."
2020-03-26,01:02:37,Unnamed,"Can I just follow up on sort of your modeling. Everyone’s talking about this Neil Ferguson study out of Imperial and how the modeling’s changed. You, last week, said… or it was on Monday that you talked about a serology test, something promising coming out of Singapore. Where are we on a serology test? The President said very quickly. And then, is that what you need to do, some sort of community survey so you can get to some of these X and Zs so you can figure this all out?"
2020-03-26,01:02:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, we’re talking to CDC right now. They are extraordinary in outbreaks and contact tracing. So, they are going to be the workforce behind any new strategy that looks at counties that need to completely move into containment and surveillance and contact tracing. But part of what they’re looking at now is, where are these antibody assays? To be clear, there is antibody assays available right now, but they’re by ELISA. And what we’re trying to do is not just do ELISAs, because they can use that now, but to be able to have point-of-care rapid diagnostics like we have with HIV, where you just get a drop of blood, you put it on a little cassette, and it tells you if you’re positive or negative. So, that’s what companies are working on."
2020-03-26,01:03:43,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:09:41].
2020-03-26,01:03:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yes, correct. That’s the IgG to measure. Now remember, that’s not going to be helpful in diagnosis. That’s going to be helpful for us to know how many asymptomatic cases there are, or were."
2020-03-26,01:03:57,John (Reporter),How close are we to figuring out what the asymptomatic rates are? Because that seems to be the big question here. [crosstalk 01:03:59]
2020-03-26,01:03:58,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It is a big question. It is a very big question, and so, we have people… the FDA is working on that around the clock. They do have applications that are coming in. We put out a call for applications. I’ve been talking about it from this podium. If you have an IgG assay rapid test, not an ELISA… I mean, you could do the ELISA today because the SARS… the original SARS antigens react very well to the current COVID-19 antibodies that people have. But we’re really working on that, both so that we could have therapeutics that could be plasma-derived, so thank you. Yes, we’re very much focused on that."
2020-03-26,01:04:40,Unnamed,"How soon will you be able to classify these counties, because there’s a lot of testing that has not been done yet?"
2020-03-26,01:04:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, there are states, and I just want to really recognize state and local health officials that, behind all of this, have continued to test and have continued to do surveillance. So, we do have states that have been doing surveillance all along, who have been doing contact tracing all along. It never gets reported because it’s not that exciting that they’ve identified 10 cases, but there are states doing that and have been doing it throughout this entire outbreak, and that’s why we have some confidence that that testing has been going on. We have to expand testing for surveillance."
2020-03-26,01:05:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But this is that… we talked about it a little bit yesterday, the flu platform? So the flu platform is driven off of emergency rooms and hospitals reporting flu-like illness to their state and local governments, and that, then, will trigger the individuals to get tested. So we have a platform that states and local governments are completely used to. They’re not used to doing it this late in the season. They’ll do it usually through the end of March, but flu usually tails off a lot by April. So, we’re asking them to continue the activation of screening for flu-like illness."
2020-03-26,01:06:01,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Now, that doesn’t get to his question about, where is the asymptomatics and how much of that? That helps us find cases and contact trace on systematic cases."
2020-03-26,01:06:12,Unnamed,"So, will there be different guidance for the places, the counties that don’t have good data yet? Will there be different CDC guidelines?"
2020-03-26,01:06:21,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So these are very early days of us trying to… what we’re trying to do is to utilize a laser- focused approach rather than a generic, horizontal approach. And I think in the 21st century, we should be able to get to that. Why am I confident that we can do that? Because we do that in Sub-Saharan Africa right now for HIV. That’s how we’re stopping the epidemic there. So we’ve done it; we’ve done it in resource-limited settings. So I do believe we can transpose that approach here to the United States and be able to have… we have granular data down to a GPS coordinate of a site of a clinic and hospital. We think that same thing can be done in the United States."
2020-03-26,01:07:04,Unnamed,"Quick question on the restrict… when you said no restrictions to states for something like that… if there was a high-risk county, and the restaurants are open in a low-risk county, wouldn’t your fear be that people in that high- risk county go over to the restaurants in that low-risk district?"
2020-03-26,01:07:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"These are dialogues that the federal government has to have with state and local governments, because state and local governments make those decisions, and that’s what’s been inspirational to me, is seeing how much the governors understand where they are in their epidemic and what they will need to do in the future."
2020-03-26,01:07:33,Dr. Deborah Birx,"This is what we’re trying to tailor. It requires us to have very clear data disaggregation at the county and state level. But I think you’ve been hearing from us, these outbreaks and clusters, we’ve been able to very well define, to date… the one that was in King County, the one that is now in New York City, the one in New Orleans, the one in Wayne County… and we can see that spread throughout the region and as closely-related counties. So this is what we’re talking about, how to do surveillance, how to do contact tracing, and how to do each of these items to make sure that you prevent that spread."
2020-03-26,01:08:11,Unnamed,What’s your timeline? What’s your timeline for implementing guidance like this?
2020-03-26,01:08:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, we have to get all of our data together. We owe it to the President, and we owe it to the President to be able to make that decision. So that’s what we’re working on right now, is getting that granularity."
2020-03-26,01:08:26,Mike Pence,"I can speak to that, too."
2020-03-26,01:08:28,Unnamed,"All right guys, last question."
2020-03-26,01:08:28,Mike Pence,I’ll go to John for a second. I can speak to that.
2020-03-26,01:08:30,Mike Pence,"The President sent a letter to all the governors today indicating that, as every American recognizes, that the importance of 15 days to slow the spread… that we’re approaching day 15. And what the president told the governors, that we’re going to listen to the very best health experts in the world, we’re going to examine that data very carefully and we’ll be presenting this weekend, the President, a range of recommendations and additional guidance for going forward."
2020-03-26,01:09:03,Mike Pence,"The President’s made it clear that, in his words, he wants to open the country up, but we’re going to do that responsibly, and as the President told the governors today, we’ll do that based on the data. John, one last one."
2020-03-26,01:09:14,Unnamed,"Can I ask a quick follow-up, Mr. Vice President?"
2020-03-26,01:09:15,Mike Pence,"I’ll just go to John, [inaudible 00:15:16]."
2020-03-26,01:09:17,John (Reporter),"Unless there was a last minute glitch, we should probably see phase three pass the house tomorrow. Already there are many members who are talking about the need for a phase four. Do you see the need for a phase four, and if so, what do you think should be addressed in it?"
2020-03-26,01:09:35,Mike Pence,"Well, first, let me just say again how grateful the President and I, and I know governors across the country are, for the extraordinary bi-partisan work that’s been done on Capitol Hill, not just in the bill that will be taken up by the House of Representatives tomorrow, but in legislation last week that extended paid family leave; free coronavirus testing to every American; made sure that all the agencies at every level of the federal government had the resources to meet this moment. It’s really been a very inspiring time."
2020-03-26,01:10:07,Mike Pence,"But what the president’s made clear to our governors, we’re going to do whatever it takes. And already, we’re hearing from some governors about the need for additional resources, and we will evaluate those very carefully, and I think the Secretary of the Treasury has already indicated, and Congressional leadership has already indicated a willingness to remain open to that. The American people know we’re all in this together, and the unity that you see on Capitol Hill, the unity that this President has marshaled among governors all across this country and our States and territories will continue to drive forward, and we’re going to make sure the people on the front lines… our healthcare workers and the people that are serving them… make sure our state governments, make sure every agency of the federal government have everything we need to put the health of America first. We’ll see you back here tomorrow. Thank you all."
2020-03-27,01:03,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Great to have you, and thank you all for being here. My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic. It’s been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world. We’ve had great success over the last month. We’ve, as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us, purchased and delivered, and we’ve made it available to the states and the governors have been very gracious, for the most part, I would say. A couple that aren’t appreciative of the incredible job, they have to do a better job themselves. That’s part of the problem. But generally speaking, I have to tell you the governors have been great. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he’s very thankful and Governor Cuomo has been very nice."
2020-03-27,02:09,Donald Trump,"They’ve really appreciated, I think, what the federal government has done, you look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. It’s been really incredible. Nobody has seen it. They’ll build hospitals in two or three days, portable hospitals. This afternoon I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to accept, perform, prioritize federal contracts for ventilators. Ventilators are a big deal and we’ve delivered thousands of them, and oftentimes you don’t need ventilators very much, hospitals don’t have very many, and now we’re turning out that we have to produce large numbers, but we’ve been able to do that and we’re going to be doing a lot more. This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis. We thought that we had a deal with, as an example, General Motors and I guess they thought otherwise they didn’t agree and now they do."
2020-03-27,03:15,Donald Trump,"They do agree and I think we might be able to pull it, but we let them know the way we felt and they can’t be doing that. We’ll work in partnership with the private sector, but where an emergency exists and it’s very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly we will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available awful authorities to get the job done. This afternoon I also signed an executive order investing, and very, very strongly investing the Department of Health and Human Services, and the department of Homeland Security with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus, the invisible enemy, as we say. My order also establishes that Peter Navarro, a very trusted person from the White House and he’s been an incredible … He’s done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going economically, but my order establishes that Peter will serve as national Defense Production Act policy coordinator for the federal government."
2020-03-27,04:30,Donald Trump,"That’s a very important position, more important probably than it’s almost ever been in our country, and so I want to congratulate Peter and his family. It’s a … I know he’s going to do a fantastic job. He’s been doing that job over the last few weeks. Peter is a PhD in economics from Harvard, has a master in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard, and he’s a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job. But I’d like to maybe ask before I continue Peter to say a few words, please."
2020-03-27,05:07,Peter Navarro,"Thank you Mr. President. And of course you know, a Harvard junkie and total Harvard man, you just can’t tell them much, right? So anyway, on a serious note, let me just give you a little idea of the Defense Production Act and why it is so important. We are engaged in the most significant industrial mobilization since World War II. We have a wartime president fighting an invisible enemy and we have the full force of government coupled with the full power of private enterprise bearing down on this problem for the American people. What we had to do today with president Trump’s order with respect to General Motors. I want to give you a little background on that. We need industrial mobilization to make adequate ventilators, particularly in the very short run to help the people in New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, all around this country as this virus bears down. And the ventilators really are the most important thing for patients who become most seriously ill."
2020-03-27,06:09,Peter Navarro,"They are literally the lifeline for people. And I personally have been working with FEMA and I’ve been working with HHS and over 10 ventilator companies, making sure we can get what we need as quickly as possible. And virtually every one of those companies has been cooperative, patriotic, moving in Trump time, which is to say as soon as possible, sir. But we did have a problem with GM and Ventech. On the one hand, we had Ford and GE moving forward on a similar kind of project, patriotically moving as fast as possible. Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM. We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days. So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating his mobilization. I salute him for doing so. It’s going to make my job so much easier. For the most part, we’ve had tremendous cooperation from the private sector. Today, sir, was the right day to do it. Thank you, sir."
2020-03-27,07:12,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Peter. Good luck. My administration is marshaling the full power of the American government and we will do that and that’s what we’ve done and we will continue to do it until our war is won. Economic, scientific, medical, military and Homeland Security. All of this to vanquish the virus. We are working to sign contracts immediately with the major ventilator companies in the country, including GE, Phillips, Medtronic, Hamilton, Zol, Resmed, Hillrob and Viar. These are all companies that do this, great companies, the FDA will be reducing and waving unnecessary regulations in order to get this done, we’re going to be getting rid of certain, let’s say, barriers to speed. We want them to get it done quickly. They’ve been doing it for a long time. They’ve been making ventilators for a long time. Hopefully General Motors will join in the fray, under the normal condition that you would be."
2020-03-27,08:22,Donald Trump,"Regular times, 29,000 ventilators are distributed in the United States each year. In the next 100 days … Well, first of all we’ve already delivered thousands of them, but within the next 100 days we will either make or get in some form over 100,000 additional units. And I guess to put it in other words, in the next 100 days we’ll receive over three times the number of ventilators made during a regular year in the United States. And that doesn’t include all of the thousands and thousands that we’ve given to the various states, a lot of them."
2020-03-27,08:59,Donald Trump,"We delivered thousands, as you know, to New York and they didn’t know they got them. And then we also had thousands put in a warehouse and that was also for New York and they just found out that they were there. So we have to make sure that when we deliver things, they get distributed. Earlier today I spoke to the CEO of Boeing, Dave Calhoun, and Boeing will be producing and donating face shields to help our medical professionals on the front lines. These are actually pretty intricate in terms of the plastic and the quality of the materials. They’re important. They’ve got to be top of the line and they’ll go into do thousands of these a week. They’ve already tested the production and they’re ready to begin producing all of these shields. It’s the plastic shields that go over the face. Boeing is also offering us the use of their, what they call the dream lifter cargo plane."
2020-03-27,09:59,Donald Trump,"It’s the largest plane in the world and this is sort of a picture of it. They called up just a little while ago and that can sort of take anything, that’s the biggest in the world and they’re letting us use that for the distribution of product all over the country, especially the heavy product or large quantities of product, and Boeing will dedicate up to three planes to the mission of flying medical supplies anywhere we needed. Each plane can carry 63, 000 pounds of cargo per flight. That’s a lot of cargo."
2020-03-27,10:35,Donald Trump,"I also signed an executive order giving the Department of defense and Department of Homeland Security the authority to activate the ready reserve components of the armed forces. This will allow us to mobilize medical disaster and emergency response personnel to help wage our battle against the virus by activating thousands of experienced service members, including retirees. We have a lot of people, retirees, great, great military people, they’re coming back in who have offered to support the nation in this extraordinary time of need. And they come back in. They don’t say, “How much?” They don’t say, “What are we getting paid?” They just want to come back in. It’s really an incredible thing to see. It’s beautiful."
2020-03-27,11:19,Donald Trump,"This afternoon I also signed into law 2.2 trillion dollars in urgently needed relief for our nation’s families, workers, businesses, and Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. And the 2.2 trillion goes to 6.2 trillion depending on need. So it’s the largest bill ever signed and not just emergency relief, but of any kind. We’ve never signed a bill of that magnitude, and incredibly it was 96 to nothing in the Senate and it was essentially the same thing in congress, they did it very quickly in the house. They did it very, very quickly."
2020-03-27,12:01,Donald Trump,"So if you look at Congress, what they’ve been able to do, the house was a voice vote, I guess they would call it, and something like that rarely takes place, and 96 to nothing in the Senate for the largest bill in the history of our country. That’s pretty good. And I want to thank Republicans, I want to thank Democrats for coming together for the whole of the nation and this is a great thing, a great victory. This is going to save companies that are incredible companies, but that are going to need some help because of what happened. A month ago, they were outstanding. They were having the best year they ever had and then we got hit and so we’ll help them out. It’s thousands and millions of jobs, millions of jobs. And I just want to thank everybody for working so hard. And that includes the people standing with me right here."
2020-03-27,12:55,Donald Trump,"The legislation extends a vital lifeline to American families and American workers with job retention loans for small businesses, and a big focus of the bill is small businesses. They’re really … They’re the energy, they’re whatever you want to call it in terms of our nation that push … People have no idea how big a factor Peter can tell you, the small businesses are in this country from an economic standpoint, from a job standpoint. We expand the unemployment benefits for workers very substantially and direct cash payments will be going to American citizens. Substantial. This legislation also provides a massive increase in funding for hospitals for the disaster relief fund, and critical supplies including masks, respirators, and pharmaceuticals of all types. And speaking of pharmaceuticals, as you know, we’re working on vaccines. We’re getting some good response and we’re working on therapeutics and cures and we have some very interesting things happening. This afternoon, Apple launched a new tool created in partnership with our task force, the CDC and FEMA. Any individual who is concerned that they might have the virus can now download the free C-O-V-I-D dash 19 app on their iPhone and answer a set of simple questions about their symptoms and risk factors. It’s getting to be a very modernized system indeed. They’ll soon receive HHS recommendations on what to do next, including whether they should get tested or not. And again, we only want people to get tested if they … If we think they need it. In a few moments. Secretary Devoss and Secretary Perdue will discuss new partnerships with the private sector that are providing meals to millions of students while schools are closed. They’ve both been incredible, the job they’ve done. I appreciate them very much. We’re grateful for the assistance of Niren Chadhaury, CEO of Panera Bread Company, they’ve been so incredible to us and to the people of our country. And Denton McClain, chairman of McClain Global Logistics, and they’ve joined us. They’re on stage with me. They’re going to speak."
2020-03-27,15:14,Donald Trump,"Throughout this ordeal, I’ve been ordered and inspired by the American people more than anything else, more than anyone else. Americans of every walk of life have followed the guidelines shown incredible compassion and sacrifice greatly on behalf of their fellow citizens. I want every American to know that their selfless and heroic actions are saving lives and I want them to know, and I’ve said it before, that I’m very proud to be their president, I’m very proud of the American people. My administration is actively planning the next phase in an all out war against this horrible virus. We’re now testing nearly 100,000 patients per day, more than anybody in the world and we have now, as of even a couple of weeks ago, tested more than any other country in the world, and our capacity continues to grow."
2020-03-27,16:05,Donald Trump,"Widespread surveillance testing will allow us to monitor the spread of the virus and we’re doing that quite accurately, and Deborah and Tony will be speaking about that and coordinate with the States to contain new hotspots as they arise with a targeted, fact-based and data-based approach. It’s all data driven. This surveillance testing will soon enable us to publish updated guidelines for state and local leaders. We want every county and region in the country to have the on-the-ground evidence that they need to determine the mitigation measures that are right for them. Each location is different. Some are very, very different. Some are day and night, some are in great shape and some aren’t in great shape, and we’ll be able to have very accurate information very shortly. We already have a lot of that information. America’s bravely battling this pandemic through cutting edge science and medical innovation and rational, deliberate and determined vigilance."
2020-03-27,17:07,Donald Trump,"No effort will be spared in winning this war. We’re going to win the war. Hopefully we’re going to win soon and with as few lives as possible lost. You see what’s going on all over the world, you see the lives, you see Italy, you see Spain, you see all of these countries going through so much, going through such hell and we’re all in very strong communication. I can tell you our professionals are dealing with them every day. Many of the countries, so many countries, but many of the countries we’re dealing very directly and closely, and we’re going to be in very good shape in terms of certain equipment that’s very hard to get, very hard to manufacture, and at the right time will be distributing that equipment throughout the world to other countries."
2020-03-27,17:51,Donald Trump,"Boris Johnson was asking for ventilators today, as you know, Boris is … He’s tested … Unfortunately he’s tested positive and it’s a terrible thing, but he’s going to be great. I’m sure he’s going to be totally great, but they want ventilators, Italy wants ventilators, Spain wants ventilators, Germany wants ventilators, they’re all calling for ventilators. Well, we’re going to make a lot of ventilators and we’ll take care of our needs, but we’re also going to help other countries."
2020-03-27,18:20,Donald Trump,"So I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank our great American citizens and a lot of incredible things are happening, really happening, and it’s too bad … I was saying before we had the press conference when we signed, we had a signing ceremony where we signed the largest bill in our history. And I said, “Think of it, 22 days ago, we had the greatest economy in the world. Everything was going beautifully. The stock market hit an all time high again for the over 150th time during my presidency, and the world was looking good. And then we got hit by the invisible enemy.” And now you have countries all over the world reeling. But we’re winning it and we’ll be a bigger and better and stronger than where we were even before. And we will also have apparatus in place that works. We won’t have broken systems, we’ll have incredible systems. So if this should happen again, hopefully it won’t. But if a thing like this should happen again, we’ll be able to handle it very much more easily. So with that I’ll take a few questions [inaudible 00:19:33]."
2020-03-27,19:33,Unnamed,Tell us a little bit about these negotiations with General Motors. What were they reluctant to do? Or was it a debate over cost or profit?
2020-03-27,19:40,Donald Trump,"Well, it got to be a debate about cost, and we don’t want to think too much about cost when we’re talking about this. This is not cost. I wasn’t happy where general motors built plants and other locations over the years, not so much during my term, but they built a lot of plants in other countries. I won’t name the countries, but you can imagine. And so I didn’t go into it with a very favorable view. I was extremely unhappy with Lordstown, Ohio, where they left Lordstown, Ohio in the middle of an auto boom because we had 17 car companies coming in and then they were leaving one plant in Ohio. I love Ohio."
2020-03-27,20:15,Donald Trump,"And what happens? That became the story. Not that all these plants are moving in, but that you had a one plant, they were leaving. And frankly I think that would be a good place to build the ventilators. But we’ll see. We’ll see how that all works out. But so I wasn’t too thrilled. And then we thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators and all of a sudden it became six and then price became a big object. But Peter Navarro’s going to handle that and Peter will do a very good job. We’ll see, maybe they’ll change their tune, but we didn’t want to play games with them."
2020-03-27,20:47,John (Reporter),"Two questions for you. One on state quarantines and the other one on this search for treatment. The first one over the last 24 hours, governors in multiple States, including Florida, Rhode Island, have issued quarantine orders for travelers coming from-"
2020-03-27,21:01,Donald Trump,The quarantine orders.
2020-03-27,21:02,John (Reporter),"Quarantine orders, yeah. And they are intercepting people on highways, at airports. They say this is at the recommendation of your administration. Is that true? And if so, why doesn’t-"
2020-03-27,21:12,Donald Trump,"I think I’m going to let Tony speak to that a little bit later. But we’re being very strong on quarantine. We’re being very strong on people not leaving, especially certain states and going to other states where they have less of a problem. I mean, you’re hearing constantly about people leaving New York and going down to Florida, and New York obviously is a hot spot and that’s why we’re building all those hospitals in New York and all those medical centers in New York. So we’ll let Tony answer to that, but specifically you have to understand, we’re not playing games. John?"
2020-03-27,21:43,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, if I can come back to the invoking DPA, this morning you tweeted about it and I’m told it was coincidentally not long after that tweet, Vintech and GM announced that they had reached an agreement to at their Kokomo, Indiana plant, which is a clean facility that makes electronic equipment, produce up to 10,000 ventilators a month with the first ones to be delivered in a couple of weeks. Why the need after that to invoke DPA?"
2020-03-27,22:08,Donald Trump,"It wasn’t after, it was before and we just were not getting there with General Motors. We weren’t getting there. We’re getting there with a lot of other companies and we have the people that are doing it for me in the room right here and we can talk to you later about it, but we have to get these people on board. We’re not looking to get into a big deal on price. We’re not looking to be ripped off on price. We don’t want prices to be double, triple what they should be. So General Motors, we’ll see what happens. But now they’re talking, but they weren’t talking the right way at the beginning and that was not right to the country."
2020-03-27,22:41,John (Reporter),"Last night you told Sean Hannity you didn’t think that there was a need for 30 or 40,000 ventilators, yet today you basically federalized General Motors to produce tens of thousands."
2020-03-27,22:50,Donald Trump,"I think there’s a very good chance we won’t need that many. And I think frankly there’s a great chance that we’re not going to need that money. But you know what, there are a lot of other people that are going to need them. We have countries all over the world that are friends of ours and we will help those countries. We’re in a position to do things that other countries can’t. So we have a sort of an interesting position we can make them, because we’re going to be making over 100,000 pretty quickly. So we can make them. And if we don’t need them, John, that’s okay because we can help Italy and we can help UK, Boris Johnson specifically. I mean when I say, “How you feeling?” And the first thing Boris said to me is, “We need ventilators.”"
2020-03-27,23:26,John (Reporter),[inaudible 00:23:29].
2020-03-27,23:29,Donald Trump,"We’re not going to be keeping them. All over the world, they want them, and we’re in a position to make them and other countries aren’t. Okay?"
2020-03-27,23:35,Unnamed,"First can follow up on that. Governor Cuomo had said 30 to 40,000 ventilators is what he needed. He based that on the experts that were advising him. What are you basing your assessment he doesn’t need that many on?"
2020-03-27,23:46,Donald Trump,"Well, if you look, and I think you can ask that question best of Deborah, but I think their estimates are high. I hope they’re high. They could be extremely high. We’re doing even hospitals based on pretty high estimates, I’m doing them anyway and as I told John, “If we do not need them, that’ll be wonderful. We can help a lot of great people all over the world. We can help them live.” But I think his estimates are going to be very high. We’re going to see. Don’t forget, we sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they didn’t know they got them. Then we sent thousands of ventilators to New York, they have a warehouse a New York, warehouse in Edison, New Jersey, which is an interesting thing. And we sent them to Edison, New Jersey. They were in the warehouse, ready to go, and New York never took them."
2020-03-27,24:32,Donald Trump,"So they knew they were there. So we have to get people lined up, but we’ve given the … And I’m not blaming New York. Look, this is something that’s of a magnitude that nobody’s ever seen before. But I’ll tell you what, the federal government’s done a hell of a job. So we sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they didn’t know about it at the time they were complaining. Thousands. We had 2,000 and then 2,000 and then 4,000, and they were going there in large numbers. And then before that we sent many thousands. We want to have so many-"
2020-03-27,25:03,Donald Trump,"And then before that we said many thousands. We want to have so many that we do have more than we need, because we can send them to other great countries, other countries that have been our friends and they’ll never be able to do it themselves. Yeah, please?"
2020-03-27,25:12,Unnamed,"You also said that some of the governors are not appreciative of what the federal government’s done, and you’ve suggested that some of these governors are not doing everything they need to do, like these governors are at fault. Can you be specific, what more in this time in this time of a national emergency-"
2020-03-27,25:25,Donald Trump,"Well, I think we’ve done a great job for the State of Washington and I think the governor, who is a failed presidential candidate as you know, he leveled out at zero in the polls, he’s constantly chirping, and I guess complaining would be a nice way of saying it. We’re building hospitals. We’ve done a great job for the State of Washington. Michigan, she has no idea what’s going on. And all she does is say, “Oh, it’s the federal government’s fault.” And we’ve taken such great care of Michigan. You know the care we’ve taken of New Jersey."
2020-03-27,25:54,Donald Trump,"I think if you ask Governor Murphy of New Jersey, “How are we doing?” I think he’d say great. I think. He’s a Democrat. Governor Cuomo has really said we’re really doing a great job, and I saw the news conference where he was thanking the people from FEMA, the people from Army Corps of Engineers this morning. I mean, they built a hospital like in three and a half days, and it’s a big hospital in the Javits Center. And they’re building medical facilities in different parts of New York, and Governor Cuomo has been appreciative. But a couple of people aren’t. We have done a hell of a job. The federal government has really stepped up."
2020-03-27,26:28,Unnamed,"But what I’m asking is, what more specifically do you want the governor of Washington, the governor of Michigan-"
2020-03-27,26:32,Donald Trump,"All I want them to do, very simple, I want them to be appreciative. I don’t want them to say things that aren’t true. I want them to be appreciative. We’ve done a great job, and I’m not talking about me. I’m talking about Mike Pence, the Task Force, I’m talking about FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers. There’s no country in the world could have done what the Army Corps of Engineers has done and is doing. Now they’re going in and building literal… They’re going into hotels and renovating hotels. That should be for governors to do. That should be for states to do."
2020-03-27,27:04,Donald Trump,"We have the Army Corps of Engineers so teed up and so stocked up and they’re really psyched and they’re incredible, and there’s no games with these people. They’re in there screaming, “Get it done, get it done.” There’s not sitting around taking it easy. These are workers. These are incredible people. So I think the Army Corps of Engineers… When somebody for political reasons wants to blame, I view that as blaming these incredible people. Nobody’s ever seen it. I don’t know if you’ve been to the Javits Center."
2020-03-27,27:32,Unnamed,Yes.
2020-03-27,27:32,Donald Trump,"Now, I’ve seen it. I would love to go there, but with all that we’re doing, we will be tomorrow at the hospital. We have this incredible hospital boat. It was supposed to be ready in three and a half weeks, because it’s under maintenance, a big maintenance contract. We were able to get it done quickly. We were able to stock it up to the top and it’s leaving tomorrow at 2:00. It’s leaving Virginia. It’ll be in New York on Monday, weeks ahead of schedule. I think things, even the media, I think the media and governors should appreciate it."
2020-03-27,28:05,Donald Trump,"And I have to say, the media has been pretty good and the governors have been really good, except for a couple. And with them, it’s just political. “How’s Trump doing?” “Oh, well, I don’t know.” Because we have done a job the likes of which nobody’s seen."
2020-03-27,28:20,Unnamed,"So, it’s the words they’re saying that you’re concerned about? It’s not that they’re-"
2020-03-27,28:22,Donald Trump,"I think they should be appreciative. Because you know what? When they’re not appreciative to me, they’re not appreciative to the Army Corps, they’re not appreciative to FEMA, it’s not right. These people are incredible. They’re working 24 hours a day. I mean, Mike Pence, I don’t think he sleeps anymore. These are people that should be appreciated. He calls all the governors. I tell him… I mean, I’m a different type of person. I say, “Mike, don’t call the Governor of Washington. You’re wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.” It doesn’t make any difference what happens-"
2020-03-27,28:52,Unnamed,You don’t want him to call the Governor of Washington?
2020-03-27,28:54,Donald Trump,"You know what I say? If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call. He’s a different type of person. He’ll call quietly anyway, okay? But he’s done a great job. He should be appreciated for the job he’s done. Yes, ma’am?"
2020-03-27,29:07,Unnamed,"Given that older Americans are advised to stay at home and avoid travel, is it absolutely necessary for you to go to Norfolk, Virginia tomorrow to wave goodbye to the ship?"
2020-03-27,29:17,Donald Trump,"No, but I have spirit for the country. I mean, we have sailors, we have doctors on that ship. We have everything. I mean, I’m not going to be a jumping around in a huddle, but yeah, I think it’s a great sign, the President of the United States. They got a ship out of maintenance, completed all the work in a fraction of the time. It was supposed to be there for three and a half additional weeks and they got it done, and it’s in great shape and they’re sending it up."
2020-03-27,29:43,Donald Trump,"So the answer… It’s a good question. It’s a fair question. I just feel that as the leader of our country, when they can do work like they’ve done, and they’ve been working all day, all night, medical supplies, everything loading up that ship, I don’t think it’s the worst thing in the world. It’s right down the road practically, right? Virginia. And I think it’s great if I go to Virginia. I guess I can take helicopter or plane. It’s a tiny trip. And I think it’s a good thing when I go over there and I say thank you. It doesn’t mean I’m going to be hugging people and it doesn’t mean that I’m going to be shaking people’s hands and everything, but I think it sends a signal when the president is able to go there and say thank you. So, we’ll be careful. Peter?"
2020-03-27,30:23,Peter (Reporter),"Mr. President, on the stockpile of supplies for a pandemic, yesterday from the podium you blamed your predecessor, saying that when you arrived as president, you said, “We took over an empty shelf.” You’ve been president now for more than three years. Why didn’t you and your administration fill that shelf?"
2020-03-27,30:38,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I did. We did fill it twice. We filled it twice and we’ve been distributing that for literally a year. We’ve been filling it [crosstalk 00:30:46]. That’s a nice question, Peter. Thank you very much. We’ve been filling it out and we’ve been filling that stockpile many, many times. It’s been filled many, many times. And now what we’re doing is something different, because I think it’s better. We’d fill it so it comes from wherever the point of manufacturer or whatever is, we fill it and then we go, “Now it’s full.” Now we take it and we distribute around. Now what we’re doing is, we have an emergency. We’re saying, “Go direct, go direct, go direct.” We fill it only where necessary, but now we’re trying to go direct."
2020-03-27,31:16,Donald Trump,"So they drop it off in New York or they drop it off in Michigan. They drop it off in Virginia, wherever it may be, Florida. Florida is getting a lot of things. And we’re finding it’s a much better system, but we’ve filled and we’ve stockpiled many, many times. Yeah, we ended up with an empty shelf. Yes, please?"
2020-03-27,31:34,Unnamed,"You spoke to Chinese President Xi yesterday. What did he tell you in terms of data that he’s going to share, and how they got the number of cases to go down?"
2020-03-27,31:42,Donald Trump,"So, I had a great conversation with the President of China last night, pretty late in the night. It was fascinating to me. They have a whole… It’s a different kind of a world. It’s a different form of government, to put it mildly. We talked for a long time. We talked for at least an hour, I guess. And one of the things I was asking him is, “When did you notice that this was happening?” We talked about the whole concept, how it happened, when it happened, what was the most effective use? I mean, was it the fact that distance… Was distance the best thing? We talked about everything."
2020-03-27,32:21,Donald Trump,"And he’s gotten and developed… Because they’re ahead of us from the standpoint of time. It happened there actually long before it happened here. By the way, it would have happened here a lot sooner had we not kept those people out, the Chinese people coming over to the country, had we not kept them out. But we talked about it, because he’s had additional experience of having been much earlier. And he’s developed some incredible theories and all of that information is coming over here. A lot of it’s already come. The data, we call it data, and we’re going to learn a lot from what the Chinese went through."
2020-03-27,32:59,Donald Trump,"Our relationship with China is very good. We also talked about the trade agreement, but I must tell you, this whole invisible enemy has taken over the world. Nobody cares about trade, nobody cares about anything. You want to talk about trade, they immediately get back to this. So we really did, we talked about trade. They’re starting to buy very heavily from the farmers under the agreement, under the trade deal that we just signed. But honestly, he, me, all of us, everybody’s talking. You turn on television, you read the papers, it’s all about this."
2020-03-27,33:33,Donald Trump,"And you know what? It probably should be mostly about this. It’s hard to talk about, “Hey, how you doing with buying from the farmers?” They have started very, very large buying, as you probably have read. But what we really focused on was this-"
2020-03-27,33:48,Unnamed,Did he ask you-
2020-03-27,33:49,Donald Trump,"I also said, “How have you done with cures? And how have you done with respect to vaccines?” We discussed that. And they’re doing like we’re doing. They’re working on it very hard. They think they have some interesting things have been determined, and we’ll see what happens. But we talked a lot about vaccine. We talked a lot about possible cures. How good would that be? I mean, that’s a game changer. So, we’ll see."
2020-03-27,34:14,Donald Trump,"And by the way, we have various things happening right now having to do with cures and vaccines. And I think we’re doing very well, especially in the vaccine thing. I think we’re very close. But as Tony will tell you, that’s a long testing process. So, we’ll see what happens."
2020-03-27,34:32,Unnamed,Did he ask you to suspend tariffs?
2020-03-27,34:33,Donald Trump,"He never asked me to suspend tariffs, no. We’re taking in billions of dollars. He never did ask me that. John?"
2020-03-27,34:40,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, on Monday will be the end of the 15 days to slow the spread of the virus. Do you expect that you will simply renew the guidelines, or do you expect that there could be some modification to those guidelines?"
2020-03-27,34:52,Donald Trump,"So John, I’ll be sitting down with this brilliant woman and this brilliant man, and lots of brilliant people that work with them, I think. Right, Deborah and Tony? And we’ll be sitting down on Monday or maybe Tuesday, depending on which is the best for everybody, and we’ll be making that determination. Okay? We’ll be making it."
2020-03-27,35:08,John (Reporter),Are there any early indications-
2020-03-27,35:09,Donald Trump,"And by the way, obviously we’re not doing it for New York. You see New York is just coming into this really heated situation. We’re building a lot of things in New York right now that nobody thought would ever be building. A lot of things are happening in New York, so obviously… But we are talking about possibly other parts of the country which really aren’t affected to any major degree. Or maybe we won’t do that, because maybe at the advice of a lot of very talented people that do this for a living, they won’t want to do that. They won’t want to expose anything. They want to do it all at one time. These are the kinds of things we’ll be talking about."
2020-03-27,35:41,John (Reporter),"So for people at home who are wondering, how long are we going to have to live like this, what advice would you give them?"
2020-03-27,35:47,Donald Trump,"Well, it depends. We do want to flatten the curve. We want to see that curve start heading down in the other direction at a minimum. And we really have to talk about areas of the country that have not been affected or certainly have had a very small affect. And we’ll see. I certainly want to get it open as soon as possible. I don’t want it to be long, but we also want it to open safe. Otherwise, what did we do?"
2020-03-27,36:10,John (Reporter),So could it be months?
2020-03-27,36:13,Donald Trump,"I hope not. I hope it’s going to be sooner. I hope it disappears faster than that. I really think that the people of our country have done a great job. Last night, I was watching and I’m looking down Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue, John, there were no people in the street. I mean, normally you wouldn’t be able to see the sidewalk. There’d be cars all over, it’d be like rush hour stuff. I’m looking at it and I’m saying, “I can’t believe it. There are no cars, there are no people.” There wasn’t one person on Fifth Avenue walking down the street. I’ve never seen that before. I guess maybe at 1:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the morning maybe. But I’ve never seen that before. The people have been incredible."
2020-03-27,36:55,Donald Trump,"When you talk about distancing, social distancing, I mean, we don’t have a law. We’re not going to put them in jail. And yet, they’re really… I think there’s two things. Number one, they are afraid. And number two, they really are wanting to win this thing. Yes, please?"
2020-03-27,37:14,Unnamed,"I wanted to ask you about, United Airlines said today that they’re worried that there’s not enough money for them in the $2.2 trillion bill that you just signed, and that at the end of the sort of aid period, which would be the end of September, where the restrictions on layoffs come off, that they could be seeing significant layoffs."
2020-03-27,37:34,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-03-27,37:34,Unnamed,"And so, I was wondering what your reaction to that was, and what the administration might do to provide some sort of-"
2020-03-27,37:38,Donald Trump,"Sure. That’s a good question. We have brilliant people. We have a tremendous amount of money, and we have brilliant people that I’m taking from Wall Street with secretary Mnuchin, who’s done an incredible job, but brilliant guy, I’m taking from Wall Street people that I’ve known, that you all know, the top people in the world. They don’t want money. I mean, will they get something? I guess maybe they’ll get, who knows? Peanuts what they want compared to what they would normally get. I’m taking the smartest, the most brilliant people in the world in finance and they’re going to be dealing."
2020-03-27,38:12,Donald Trump,"I’m not going to hire somebody that’s never done it, that’s a political person or anything else. We’re getting the most brilliant financial minds in the world. I know all of them, you know all of them. I mean, you read about all of them. I guess some you don’t read about, and they’re probably the smartest of them all. But the fact is, we’re taking these brilliant people and they’ll be dealing with United and they want to help."
2020-03-27,38:35,Donald Trump,"Look, I’ll tell you right now, the airline business has always been a tough business. It’s always been a very tough business, tough to make money with. Every barrier you can have, that business has. But for our country, it’s very important. We have to take care of our country. We need the airlines to stay. It’s also big for jobs. So, we will be able to handle United and we’ll be able to handle Delta and we’ll be able to handle all of it. We have plenty of money."
2020-03-27,39:00,Donald Trump,"Now, will we end up owning large chunks, depending on what these great geniuses decide along with the executives of the different companies? It’s possible, and they’ll make a better deal on the loan, but the taxpayer will then end up owning a big chunk of companies. As an example, Boeing. Boeing until a year ago was the greatest company, I think in the world by far. To me, there wasn’t anything close. I believe it was 1% of GDP. Okay? Think of that. One company, 1% of GDP. It was flawless. Then it had the problems and then it had on top of it, this whole thing with the virus. So Boeing will probably need a hand, and we’re going to bring Boeing back to health."
2020-03-27,39:41,Donald Trump,"But we have the smartest people in the world. I don’t even know if you know that. I think this could be the first time you’ve heard it. People like Larry Fink we’re talking to, that’s BlackRock, and we have the smartest people and they all want to do it. I mean, this to them, they will… They love this country. They all want to do it. So, we’re speaking to people like that and they’ll be able to work it out."
2020-03-27,40:04,Unnamed,"I guess my question is, there’s probably a tension between bringing companies back to economic health and protecting people’s jobs. And I’m wondering if you’re going to intervene and ask the Treasury Secretary Mnuchin-"
2020-03-27,40:14,Donald Trump,"No, I think they’re the same thing. I mean, bringing people back to health and protecting people’s jobs. To me, and I’m okay at this stuff, that’s the same thing. I’m in a much different position as president than if I were an investor or something, but I want to bring them back to health, because I want to preserve their jobs. But I also want to preserve airlines, because that’s preserving lots of other jobs. That’s preserving the travel and leisure industry, which is perhaps the largest industry in our country if you add it all up. You add up all the hotels and all the traveling and all the planes and everything else, probably by far the largest industry in our country."
2020-03-27,40:51,Donald Trump,"So saving the airlines is very important. And the airlines were all doing well. The airlines were doing record business a month before this today, let’s say. Even 22 days to be exact, right? When we first started seeing some real signs of problems, they were at record levels. Last year they had a record year. The biggest in the history of the airlines. Everybody was doing well. I mean, I was presiding over the most successful economy in the history of the world. And now we’re going to have to rebuild it, and I think we’re going to have an absolute incredible fourth quarter. And maybe it’s slightly after that to be honest, but it’s going to be in that time period. As soon as we get rid of this, I think we’re going to have an explosion upward. It’s going to be incredible. Please?"
2020-03-27,41:42,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has issued some of the fewest restrictions in the country, yet Florida has the highest percentage of elderly in the country."
2020-03-27,41:49,Donald Trump,That’s true.
2020-03-27,41:50,Unnamed,Do you believe governor DeSantis is handling this well?
2020-03-27,41:54,Donald Trump,"I do, because he’s a very talented guy. He’s a very good governor. Everyone loves him. He’s doing a fantastic job for Florida. He was not happy with the people coming down from New York. They’re flying down from New York, and he had a state and has a state, with obviously a lot less problems. Florida has been doing really well in the sense of testing. The testing has shown much better results. Maybe they’ll talk to you about that later."
2020-03-27,42:20,Donald Trump,"But no, he was very unhappy with the people coming down from New York, and I understand that. No, Ron’s a very tough guy. He’s a great governor and I have tremendous confidence in him. And he had the beach situation. He resolved that. He will get it all resolved. Yeah, please?"
2020-03-27,42:37,Unnamed,"I have two questions, Mr. President. First, yesterday in your letter to the governors, you said that you want to categorize certain counties of high risk, medium risk, and low risk. Practically speaking, how are you going to enforce that? How can you stop people from-"
2020-03-27,42:52,Donald Trump,You have to go louder. You’re going to have to speak louder.
2020-03-27,42:54,Unnamed,"Sorry. How are you going to stop people from going from high risk to low risk areas, in your letters to the governors?"
2020-03-27,43:05,Donald Trump,"We have some very, very strong restrictions. But you’re right, I don’t like it. So, we’re seeing how it works. The data is coming in on Monday and Tuesday, and we’re going to see how it looks. But can we go to a tougher level? We can, but that causes other problems. We’re going to see, and we’ll be reporting back very shortly after my meetings with Tony, Deborah, and others that we’re going to be meeting with, and our vice president. And we’re going to be reporting back to the media. Okay? Please, corner?"
2020-03-27,43:35,Owen Jensen,"Thank you. Hi, Mr. President. Owen Jensen with EWTN news."
2020-03-27,43:39,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-27,43:40,Owen Jensen,"Millions of school kids across the country are home, including my own, bored, restless learning a little bit online, but it’s better in the classroom, you know that. And my kids, they’re climbing the walls and my wife is about to lose it, right? So, many of them are watching right now. What would you say to those kids right now, elementary school, middle school, high school? What would you tell them right now, who are watching from home?"
2020-03-27,44:03,Donald Trump,"I would say that you are a citizen of the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we were attacked like nothing that’s happened possibly since 1917, many, many years ago. We were attacked, and we’re winning the battle and we’re going to win, and it’s not going to take hopefully that much longer, but we have to win the war. And I would say that they have a duty to sit back, watch, behave, wash their hands, stay in the apartment with mom and dad. They look like they’re lucky to have you as a father. And just learn from it."
2020-03-27,44:41,Donald Trump,"But the young people have been tremendous. Some of them are very happy not to go to school. You understand that. Perhaps yours, perhaps not. We have literally had no problem. But again, they should just sit back and be very proud of our country, because we’re doing it for them. Ultimately, we’re doing it for them more than anything else if you think about it."
2020-03-27,45:06,Donald Trump,"The other thing that’s nice and the one thing that has come out, and I learned this, again it was reaffirmed by president Xi last night in my conversation, the young people are really, this is an incredible phenomenon, but they are attacked, successfully attacked to a much lesser extent by this pandemic, by this disease, this whatever they want to call it. You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you can call it many different names. I’m not sure anybody even knows what it is, but the children do very well. It’s almost the younger they are, the better they do. I guess the immune system is… Sadly, for some of us, their immune system is stronger. But actually, I’m very happy about that."
2020-03-27,45:52,Donald Trump,"But they have been attacked. For instance, the Spanish flu, and if you look at the H1N1, if you take a look at the swine flu, which was as you know not so long ago, that attacked very young children, kids, middle age people, everyone. Age is a factor here, so your children should be in good shape, but just tell them to be very proud of the country. Okay?"
2020-03-27,46:19,Owen Jensen,"Just to follow up real quickly, when does the risk become an acceptable one to allow people to go back to their lives? Maybe Dr. Fauci could-"
2020-03-27,46:24,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to make that determination. And you’re going to have something to do with that. I mean, look, we’re going to be guided also. You have some real strong feelings, the media. I’ll tell you what, the media generally… I mean, I’m impressed. A lot of the media has been fair. I’m not used to fair treatment in the media. I don’t know how to handle it, but overall I think the media has been pretty fair. Some not. I mean, I could tell you who, but what’s the point? But the media has really been fair. I mean, they view this as we’re all in a problem together and we’re going to win. We’re going to win. Please?"
2020-03-27,46:59,Unnamed,"Yes. Thank you, President Trump. New York is currently the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., with about half of the cases. Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway laid a lot of the blame for that on the mayor, pointing out that he told people to go about life as normal and he resisted closing schools and businesses. I’m wondering if you agree. And also if I could ask you your thoughts on the stimulus bill preventing aid to your businesses. Do you think that’s fair, and what are your thoughts on that?"
2020-03-27,47:24,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s not happening. I mean, I think they wrote us out and that’s all right. But that’s not happening. As far as the Mayor of New York, I’ll be honest, I didn’t know him well. He and I are obviously opposite persuasion and we would go at it, but we didn’t… I don’t know if we ever spoke to other than to maybe say hello a couple of times. I did down at the World Trade Center Memorial once a long time ago."
2020-03-27,47:52,Donald Trump,"So, I’ve spoken to him a lot, Mayor de Blasio, and we’ve really had incredibly productive discussions. I’ve gotten him a lot of people. We’ve gotten him a medical center he’s asked for at Elmhurst. I know Elmhurst Hospital very well. I mean, that was an area of Queens that I grew up in. And boy, you talk about an epicenter. That’s really the epicenter of the epicenter. That’s really something. We talked about it, because that was very close to where I grew up. And knowing it, being so familiar with it, it’s incredible to see where they have the trucks. I don’t have to go into great detail. The refrigerated trucks coming up, and I’ve never seen anything like it."
2020-03-27,48:37,Donald Trump,"I’ve spoken with Mayor de Blasio a lot in the last week. We’ve helped him, I think a lot, and I’ve really gotten to like him. I get along with him very well. Now, he wants us to do certain things and we’ve produced. I mean, today I spoke to him with the Secretary of Defense Esper, and we had a great conversation and we’re helping him get some of the things he needs. I don’t have to go into great detail, but he’s very happy about what we’re able to do for him today. And he’s like us. He’s working very hard. But I can’t say anything bad about Mayor de Blasio. I mean, my relationship with him over the last couple of weeks has been excellent and we’ve done a good job for him too. Yeah, please?"
2020-03-27,49:22,Unnamed,"There’s been a lot of talk about ventilators and PPE and that kind of thing, but what about hospital capacity? And are you prepared for the stories that are going to come-"
2020-03-27,49:33,Donald Trump,"So, we’re doing that. Great question. We’re increasing capacities-"
2020-03-27,49:36,Unnamed,When hospitals can?
2020-03-27,49:37,Donald Trump,"Right. We’re actually adding on through the Army Corps of Engineers. This is a big job and we’re doing it in many states, not just New York and California. By the way, Gavin Newsom’s been terrific. I have to tell you, the Governor of California, we’re getting along really well. We’re working hard for him. As you know, the other hospital ship, and they are incredible. That just arrived in Los Angeles, fully stocked. But Gavin Newsom has been-"
2020-03-27,50:03,Donald Trump,"In Los Angeles, fully stocked. But Gavin Newsom has been really good, and so many of the governors have been good, and these are governors that I’ve been fighting with about different things for a long time. The forest fires in his case, and the border, and all sorts of things. And here we are getting along very well. And I appreciate his nice words. I really do. I really appreciate it. And the people with me appreciate it. Do you have another question?"
2020-03-27,50:28,Unnamed,"Well, I was going to say on the issue of hospital capacity and beds, and being able to treat people-"
2020-03-27,50:32,Donald Trump,Yeah. Good question.
2020-03-27,50:34,Unnamed,And not have them die because they can’t have a hospital bed.
2020-03-27,50:37,Donald Trump,"I mean, look, we just started this, we were just notified. And some of the governors have asked us to build hospitals through extensions, through portable hospitals, through things. And normally, in all fairness, this is done normally through local government. We don’t go into cities and expand a hospital that’s existing, but we’re doing it now, because we really are equipped to do it. We have incredible people, and where expanding hospitals, we’re building many portable hospitals. Not only Javits Center, where you have four, plus you have four medical centers, but we’re doing it in New Jersey. Governor Murphy. We’re doing it in other states. We’re doing it in California. We’re doing some in the state of Washington, despite the fact that I’m not appreciative of the way the governor speaks. We’re doing it in a lot of different locations, and we’re doing a lot of expansions. We’re also taking over buildings, and the city will go in, or the state usually will go in, take over a building, and we go in and equip it and make it so that it’s now hospital functioning. They call it hospital functioning. We’re doing a lot of that. Again, this is normally done by governors, and then give it to the city to do it. You know, you bring it into the point, but we’re doing a lot of that, and they’re doing a great job, mostly done by the Army Corps of Engineers, and FEMA."
2020-03-27,51:57,Unnamed,"Couple of questions on those governors, you and your team obviously have had classified briefings on the pandemic, I assume for a while now. Were the governors included in those briefings that you would’ve got in January and February?"
2020-03-27,52:07,Donald Trump,That I don’t know.
2020-03-27,52:07,Unnamed,Why didn’t you warn the governors as you would have had the information first?
2020-03-27,52:10,Donald Trump,"Yeah. Well they say I had classified briefings a long time ago, which wasn’t true. But we’ve had briefings, and as I know it, the governors have also had many briefings by-"
2020-03-27,52:21,Unnamed,When did you first warn them? To tell them this thing was coming?
2020-03-27,52:25,Donald Trump,"I think we knew for a while, but if you take a look, I was the first one to say to China, and I have great respect for China, I will tell you that. But I was the first one when they had the problem, to say you can’t come in. And if you go back, that’s a long time ago. Jon, please?"
2020-03-27,52:39,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, on this question of the ventilators, I understand you have a question whether or not New York needs as much as they want. Governor Cuomo’s saying 21 days from now."
2020-03-27,52:47,Donald Trump,"Here’s what we’re going to have. Are you ready? We’re going to have more than, we’re manufacturing a lot of them now, we’re accumulating a lot. We’re taking a lot, through the act, we’re taking a lot. We’re actually taking them. And we’re going to have in a very short period of time, and Peter’s doing it along with some very talented people, some really talented people. It’s very impressive actually, but we’re actually taking a lot. We’re going to have plenty. And if for some reason, Jon, if for some reason you’re going to need even more, we’re going to be prepared."
2020-03-27,53:17,Donald Trump,"As an example, we’ve given out thousands and thousands, which I think you’ll know. We accumulated thousands. We give them out. But we right now, I think in the stockpile, we have over 10,000. The reason we don’t want to distribute that is for exactly what you’re saying. If there’s a mad rush in New York, or maybe in Louisiana, or maybe someplace else, we don’t want to have given out all of those units, the ventilators, and then in those sections we give them to Iowa, but they didn’t have a problem in Iowa. We give them to Idaho. We give them to lots of different places, and now we have to try and get them back, which is never easy to do."
2020-03-27,53:52,John (Reporter),Here’s my question.
2020-03-27,53:52,Donald Trump,"No Jon, what I’m saying is this, we are prepared for things that nobody has any idea that we’d be prepared. And you know what? When I took this over, it was an empty box. We didn’t have testing, we didn’t have anything. We had a broken system there. We had a broken system with stockpiling, we had a lot of broken systems. And I’m not just blaming President Obama, you go long before that, but in all fairness, all of the former presidents, none of them ever thought a thing like this could happen. But we have right now, 10,000 ventilators in stockpile. We are ready to go with those ventilators."
2020-03-27,54:29,Donald Trump,"What we don’t want is where we distribute the ventilators like we did in New York, and they didn’t need them, or they didn’t know, or they didn’t use them. If we need them in New York, we’re going to have plenty. Now, we’re getting a lot of ventilators in the next short period of time. A lot of ventilators are coming in the next short period of time. We’re manufacturing. We went to all of the companies, I read their names, we went to all of those companies. They are going to go, I would say ’round the clock, Peter, is that right? They’re going round the clock."
2020-03-27,54:59,John (Reporter),"Is 100 days fast enough? You said, is that fast enough? To get 100,000? Because some of these people need them in three weeks."
2020-03-27,55:02,Donald Trump,"Let’s put it this way. Let’s put it this way. We’ve distributed thousands and thousands already. Normally these would be bought by states, just so you understand. Normally these would be bought by governors. They were… I don’t want to say unprepared, but nobody was prepared for this. What we’ve done, nobody can even imagine. And by the way I’ve had governors tell me, including Democrat governors, they said, “We can’t believe you’ve been able to do this.” And you go to other countries, and we’re not only competing against states, because we don’t want to compete against states. We’ve had a couple of cases where states were buying, we were buying, and I said specifically, because I heard about it. Pull back. Let the state buy it. Immediately, the price goes way down, and they end up buying it. But we’re also competing against many countries, because many countries need the ventilators. That’s why I want to build more if possible. Jon, maybe we’ll take one more question."
2020-03-27,55:50,John (Reporter),"The question I was building up to is, are you able to guarantee, to assure these states, these hospitals, that everybody who needs a ventilator, will get a ventilator?"
2020-03-27,56:02,Donald Trump,"So here’s what I’ll tell you. I think we’re in really good shape. This is a pandemic, the likes of which nobody’s seen before. I think we’re in great shape. I think that number one, we’ve distributed… ventilators are a big deal. We’ve distributed vast numbers of ventilators, and we’re prepared to do vast numbers. I think we’re in great shape. I hope that’s the case. I hope that we’re going to have leftovers, so we can help other people, other countries."
2020-03-27,56:28,John (Reporter),Everybody who needs one will be able to get a ventilator?
2020-03-27,56:31,Donald Trump,"Look, look. Don’t be a cutie pie. Okay? Everyone who needs one."
2020-03-27,56:35,John (Reporter),It’s a fundamental question.
2020-03-27,56:35,Donald Trump,"Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. Nobody’s done anything like we’ve been able to do. And everything I took over was a mess. It was a broken country in so many ways, in so many ways other than this. We had a bad testing system. We had a bad stockpile system, we had nothing in the stockpile system. So I wouldn’t tell me what you’re, you know, like being a wise guy. Go ahead."
2020-03-27,56:58,Unnamed,"Mr President, you signed a bill today, the size of which could choke an entire herd of horses. And before you even had a chance to put pen to paper, people were already talking about the need for phase four. Do you see a need for phase four, and where do you think the priorities would-"
2020-03-27,57:12,Donald Trump,"There may be something where we’re going to have to help states, because the states have been hurt very badly. And the beautiful thing about our country is, 6.2 trillion, because it is 2.2 plus four, it’s 6.2 trillion dollars, and we can handle that easily, because of who we are, what we are. It’s our money, it’s our… we are the ones. It’s our currency. We can handle it, and we can handle… I watched Jerome Powell the other day, and he did a good job. He said, we’ll do whatever we have to do. Jon, we have to do whatever we have to do."
2020-03-27,57:53,Unnamed,Where do you see the priorities being?
2020-03-27,57:55,Donald Trump,"The priority is life, and safety, and then the economy. Life, and safety."
2020-03-27,58:01,John (Reporter),"Could the Easter goal stick? It seems like earlier in the week you said we’d love Easter, but now it seems like it could be longer."
2020-03-27,58:06,Donald Trump,"We’ll see. No, no, no, we’ll see. A lot of things can-"
2020-03-27,58:07,John (Reporter),These people are heading into a long weekend. What do you tell those folks who think they’re going to have to wait this out for a while?
2020-03-27,58:10,Donald Trump,"I tell them, if it’s your life, then it’s your safety, and if we need more time, they’re not going to have a problem waiting it out. It’s life, it’s safety, and it’s our country, but we have to take care of people. At the same time, we want to get them out. They want to get out. Our country was built on that, but we have to make sure it’s safe, and everyone knows that. Okay. One more question, please."
2020-03-27,58:32,Unnamed,Has your thinking changed over the last 30 days-
2020-03-27,58:34,Unnamed,"Mr. President, sir, thank you. Both the World Health Organization as recently as today, and your own health officials have said that any treatments that we use for Coronavirus should be scientifically demonstrated to be effective. But at the same time you’ve said that Chloroquine as an example could be used as a cure very soon. So is WHO and your health officials wrong on this point?"
2020-03-27,58:55,Donald Trump,"So Hydroxychloroquine, which is supposed to be the better of the two seems to have some good backing. We’re going to see. Look, Governor Cuomo, we’ve given him 10,000 units. It’s a lot. And they’re testing it. It’s a malaria drug. It’s also a drug for arthritis, and it’s phenomenal for those two things, as you probably know, especially for malaria. But we’re going to find out soon. I hope it works. There are signs that it could be doing well, they are testing 10,000 units. It’s a lot. And I tell you what, I want to thank the FDA, because they approved it immediately, based on the fact that it was already out for a different purpose. They approved it immediately. So look, Hydroxychloroquine is a very powerful drug for certain things. And it’s a very successful drug. There’s reason to believe that it could be successful here. Now, the reason I disagree with you, and I think Tony would disagree with me, but the reason I disagree with you is that we have a pandemic."
2020-03-27,01:00:02,Donald Trump,"We have people dying now. If we’re going to go into labs and test all of this for a long time, we can test it on people right now, who are in serious trouble, who are dying. If it works, we’ve done a great thing. If it doesn’t work, we tried. But this is not something that’s going to kill people. So we can go in, and we can test, and we can take our time. When I was with the FDA, they indicated that, “Well, we’ll start working on it right away, and it could take a year.” I said, “What do you mean a year? We have to have it tonight. If we don’t have it tonight, I want to test it immediately. Because it’s on the market in a different form.” So we know that. So from a safety standpoint, at least we know that, but you’re talking about giving it to people, who in many cases are dying. So we want to do it the way… this is sort of like Right-To-Try. We got Right-To-Try approved."
2020-03-27,01:00:55,John (Reporter),Can I ask you-
2020-03-27,01:00:56,Donald Trump,"Jon, for 44 years or more, they couldn’t get it approved. We have the best labs, the best doctors. They couldn’t get it… I got it approved. Now, if somebody’s terminally I’ll, and if we think we have something that’s going to work, we can actually use it. They can use it, and I’ll tell you what you ought to do when this is over. You’ve got to do a story on that, because we have had some tremendous results."
2020-03-27,01:01:16,John (Reporter),"Just before you go, can I ask you something that just popped on Wall Street Journal? Says headline, The Trump Administration plans to suspend the collection of import tariffs for three months according to administration officials. True, or not true?"
2020-03-27,01:01:27,Donald Trump,"It’s not even talked to me about, just more fake news Jon. Look, not even talked to me. They’re talking about… the only one I’ve heard that from, like as an example, China pays 25% interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in. That’s a lot. Everybody keeps saying, “Oh, are you going to suspend the tariffs?” Well, the answer’s no, but President Xi never even brought it up last night, it wasn’t even discussed. It’s fake news. Tell the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal does a lot of fake news too. It’s pretty amazing."
2020-03-27,01:01:59,Donald Trump,"So I want to leave you by just saying, I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank the American public, and all of the people that have helped so much, and we’re going to give the podium to vice president Pence, who has been incredible, and if he’s tired, and if he’s not answering questions like he should, we have a great reason, because he hasn’t slept in about four weeks. But I want to thank him, because he has dedicated, I mean he is a dedicated person long before this, but the job he’s done has been fantastic. So I want to thank Mike, all the people on the task force, and FEMA, and Army Corps, everybody. You’ve been fantastic. Thank you all very much."
2020-03-27,01:02:37,John (Reporter),Thank you Mr. President.
2020-03-27,01:02:37,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. President.
2020-03-27,01:02:49,Mike Pence,"Well, good evening everyone, and thank you Mr. President, White House Coronavirus Taskforce have met today. We continue at the president’s direction to focus on slowing the spread of the Coronavirus through mitigation, expanded testing, and ensuring that our healthcare workers have the supplies that they need. With cases now in all 50 states, and more than 50% of cases in the New York area. It’s more important than ever to adhere to the guidance of state and local authorities. And for every American, the best thing that you can do, young or old is put into practice the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines For America. It is the way that each of us can do our part. Since we last spoke, as you all know, the president signed the Coronavirus Aid Relief Economic Security Act. This makes direct payments available to American families. The average family of four would receive a direct payment of some $3,400. It also covers payroll for small businesses across the country for a period of several months, so that even if the business is closed, they can continue to have a loan which would be completely forgiven if they keep their whole team on the payroll."
2020-03-27,01:04:13,Mike Pence,"There’s support for critical industries, for hospitals, and for states as well. As of this evening, the president has issued 12 major disaster declarations most recently for the states of Maryland, and Missouri. And on the subject of vaccines, Emory University in Atlanta today began enrolling volunteers in a phase one clinical trial of another possible vaccine for the Coronavirus. On the subject of testing, testing is available in all 50 states, and as a great credit to our partnership with commercial laboratories across the country, this morning it was reported that more than 685,000 tests have already been performed, and we are particularly grateful to the American Hospital Association, whose members are now reporting in to the CDC and FEMA in realtime, giving our experts more visibility on those that have contracted the disease around the country."
2020-03-27,01:05:18,Mike Pence,"The president mentioned this, but it’s worth mentioning again, Apple has a new app out. It is a screening tool that’ll help Americans determine whether they should be tested. It has a easy format, question and answer. If you have issues about whether or not a test is appropriate for you, you can use the new Apple app to accomplish that as well. On the subject of supplies, the president spoke about the priority that we’re placing on personal protective equipment, and especially ventilators, and I will not add to that. I can tell you that this weekend, we’ll be reporting on aggressive efforts that our Supply Stabilization Task Force at FEMA is taking to import medical supplies from around the world. We’re working as we speak on an air lift from a number of countries around the globe, to deliver very important medical protective equipment to the United States. At the present moment, you’ve heard the numbers, but from the strategic national stockpile, we distributed more than seven million N95 respirators, or masks, almost three million face shields, more than 8,000 ventilators, and donations to the Strategic National Supply."
2020-03-27,01:06:42,Mike Pence,"We’ve mentioned Apple donating some nine million masks that can be used by healthcare workers, but Merck recently announced plans to donate 500,000 masks, USPAS, 500,000 masks. And a little company called Puritan in Maine is actually in the business now of manufacturing swabs, so businesses large and small all across America are rising to the challenge. As the president noted, he will attend the embarkation of the US Navy ship Comfort tomorrow from Norfolk, the US and Navy ship Mercy arrived in Los Angeles today. We will continue to focus resources and supplies on those areas around the country that have seen significant outbreak. But let me send a word to hospital workers around the country. We continue to hear anecdotally, and occasionally see in media reports people who have concerns that their hospital may be running short on personal protective equipment in the days ahead. We just encourage you to alert your hospital administrator. Hospital administrators, please alert your state health director."
2020-03-27,01:07:53,Mike Pence,"Tonight, administrator Gaynor at FEMA will be speaking to all of the state emergency directors in America to talk about the availability of resources, but also encouraging them to have a plan to perhaps even use their National Guard to move medical equipment from storehouses to hospitals. We’ll be working very closely with state emergency managers on issues of logistics. But today, we’re fortunate to be joined by two members of the cabinet who have been very busy making sure that the children of America have the meals that they need while school has been suspended in so many places around the country. Secretary Devos and secretary Perdue are going to share some exciting news, and progress that we’ve made in feeding children who need nutrition assistance while schools are closed. The truth is, many underprivileged kids would not be getting school meals, apart from the fact that as we stand here today, our administration has approved waivers for all 50 states to give them flexibilities to work with local partners to get meals to children that are in need, and also a nationwide waiver to allow parents to pick up meals."
2020-03-27,01:09:05,Mike Pence,"But what’s most exciting today, as our two cabinet secretaries will reflect, we have private sector partners, a few of whom are with us today, who are helping us speed important meals to children, and to families around the country. You’ll hear in a few moments from the chairman of McLean Global Logistics, and also the CEO of Panera Bread about the work that they are both doing to literally deliver millions of meals to American families. It’s truly an inspiring story, and I look forward to hearing it from them, and sharing it with you. But it’s just one more example, as President Trump said, that we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this together. Not only a whole of federal government approach, working with all of our state partners, working with healthcare authorities at the local level, but also working with businesses that have been willing to step up, and stand at the point of the need, and be there for the most vulnerable and help us meet the needs of our children, and of our families. And on behalf of the president, a grateful nation, we thank you."
2020-03-27,01:10:06,Unnamed,Madam secretary.
2020-03-27,01:10:07,Sec. DeVos,"Thank you so much Mr. Vice President, and I just want to begin by thanking President Trump for his clear-eyed leadership during these challenging times for our country, and for our world, and vice president Pence for your tremendous leadership of the task force, and for truly making a difference. Making a difference that’s certainly true for America’s students and teachers as well, most of them, as Owen said a moment ago, experiencing unprecedented disruptions in learning, and in their lives. I want each of them to know that President Trump and his administration are taking decisive action, to keep them safe and healthy, so they can continue learning. We must rise to the challenge of educating all children from all walks of life, who all of a sudden are in many, many different learning environments. And they’re counting on all of us to find solutions. I’m really pleased to be here today for the announcement of another terrific solution initiated under the president’s leadership."
2020-03-27,01:11:14,Sec. DeVos,"Secretary Perdue is going to share details of this public private partnership, but before that, I’d like to provide a few additional comments, and talk about the work that the Department of Education has been doing on behalf of students, parents, and teachers during this national emergency. My team and I are in contact daily with governors, state school chiefs, college presidents, superintendents and local education leaders. We are quickly responding to their needs, so they can do the next right thing for their students. Most governors have decided to close some or all schools in their states for a period of time. As a result, students may not be able to take federally mandated standardized tests this spring. And the president took action to make sure they didn’t have to. We made the process to delay these tests for a year fast and painless. As of today, 47 States have requested the delay, or the waiver, and 46 have been approved within a 24-hour period. We also released additional information making clear the expectation that education will continue for all students."
2020-03-27,01:12:25,Sec. DeVos,"The transition to distance and online learning needs to happen quickly, and it needs to include meaningful instruction, and supports for children with disabilities. Learning should not stop or be denied because schools fear federal regulators, or fear doing something different. Distance learning is happening. States like New Hampshire and Florida have implemented phased and tiered approaches to meet the needs of students in their states. Other schools and states are implementing creative approaches and working through practical realities to help students continue learning. In remote Colorado mountain towns without internet connectivity, teachers are putting weekly learning packets together, and they’re holding office hours by phone to help their students when they’re stuck. South Carolina’s deploying 3,000 buses with mobile wifi hotspots, to help kids in remote areas access learning that way. This national emergency gives all of us an opportunity to come together to educate all students out of principle. It’s simply not an acceptable option to educate none of them out of fear. So we stand ready to assist educators, and their students. We’re compiling all of the tools we have produced, along with the great resources that states are offering to help keep learning going."
2020-03-27,01:13:44,Sec. DeVos,"There are already many existing online learning platforms, and many states were already offering a robust menu of courses virtually. We will be adding that information to our website on an ongoing basis, and that site is Ed.gov/ Coronavirus. We’re using every tool possible to extend flexibility to states and communities. This includes funding flexibility. Where we don’t have the latitude, we’re working with Congress on solutions. One area is providing direct financial support to students, families and teachers. We will propose Congress provide micro grants to help students continue to learn. These would be focused toward the most disadvantaged students in our states or communities where their school system has simply shut down. I’ve always believed education funding should be tied to students, not systems, and that necessity has never been more evident. We’ll also support micro grants to teachers, to help them pivot to supporting all of their students in a different environment than they’ve been used to. We know they are dealing with an unprecedented situation, but it’s been truly inspiring to hear story after story of teachers rising to the occasion, and meeting the unique needs of each of their students. Ultimately, we know everyone’s grappling with the challenge of keeping students safe and healthy, while also building…"
2020-03-27,01:15:03,Betsy DeVos,"… with the challenge of keeping students safe and healthy while also building capacity for remote learning. It’s an important moment to realize that learning can and does happen anywhere and everywhere. I think of the Texas dad who started a daily webinar interviewing friends and acquaintances in wildly different careers and helping students understand what it takes to work in that chosen career, or the history teacher in Virginia who connects with his students through a livestream every morning. I think of the art teacher in Tennessee who’s broadcasting her lessons over social media, or of Second Lady Karen Pence, who prepares packages of art materials and projects for her students to pick up with their school lunches, or the principal in Alabama who’s going online daily, giving morning announcements, leading the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence. I think of the many schools that have distributed laptops and tablets to students who don’t have them so they can continue learning over video conference and the ones that just don’t have that option currently, like the remote Colorado towns."
2020-03-27,01:16:03,Betsy DeVos,"Joy Hoffmeister, the school chief in Oklahoma, may have put this best. She told me, “School isn’t a building. It’s students, teachers, and families working together to advance learning.” She’s right, and that’s our shared mission."
2020-03-27,01:16:19,Betsy DeVos,"Let me also touch very briefly on how we’re supporting students pursuing higher education. At the beginning of this outbreak, we immediately gave institutions of higher education regulatory flexibility so learning could go online, and it did. In many cases, it was a seamless transition, and learning continues. We’re continuing to cut federal bureaucracy and let schools rise to meet this challenge. We’ve vastly improved distance learning policies, which we’re working quickly to enact for traditional higher education."
2020-03-27,01:16:52,Betsy DeVos,"Shorter-term programs, and apprenticeships also need to grow and thrive, and as the President has so effectively championed, workers need these options as they look to come back stronger than ever from these momentary setbacks."
2020-03-27,01:17:05,Betsy DeVos,"The President promised to defeat this invisible enemy and keep our economy strong. He took immediate action and provided student loan relief to tens of millions of borrowers. We set all federally held student loans to 0% interest rates and deferred payments for 60 days. Now with the CARES Act that he signed just earlier today, Mr. President, those actions will extend to six months."
2020-03-27,01:17:32,Betsy DeVos,"We hope these actions and others we’ve taken for those who’ve become delinquent on payments or have had other issues with their student loan payments will help alleviate the financial burden and anxiety students and their families are feeling during these tough times. These are tough times, but we the people are tougher."
2020-03-27,01:17:52,Betsy DeVos,"So in closing, let me offer just a few words of encouragement. To our students, your educations can and should continue. Learning can happen anywhere, and we will help make sure it does. We believe in you. To our teachers, we will support you and help you. You are doing great work. Keep it up."
2020-03-27,01:18:16,Betsy DeVos,"To every parent and family, we know these are challenging times, but it’s in the face of great challenges that Americans have always risen to the occasion and embraced greatness, and I know we’ll do that once again. I thank, again, the President and the Vice President for their leadership on behalf of America’s students and on behalf of all of us. Now we’ll turn to my friend Secretary Sonny Perdue to share more on how we’re working together to help support student nutrition."
2020-03-27,01:18:48,Sonny Perdue,"Thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, while our dedicated educators are out there trying to continue to fill our kids with knowledge, even when they’re not in a school site, the USDA is working very hard to continue to fill their tummies. You may know that many of these children receive breakfast and lunch at their school sites, and our federal government participates with our dedicated school nutritional and lunch professionals throughout the country. We have issued waiver after waiver to make this flexibilities available for things that make sense when children cannot congregate in a singular location."
2020-03-27,01:19:23,Sonny Perdue,"That’s one of the first waivers we did, we issued, and when Congress gave us the authority to issue more, we are turning those waivers around in rapid speed, really less than 24 hours. So we’re very fortunate that we’ve got a great team and our food nutrition consumer services team working 24/7 to make sure that our kids continue to be fed. It’s a great partnership that’s happening out there."
2020-03-27,01:19:49,Sonny Perdue,"I want to mention one other simple but very important point about another matter that your listeners and readers may be very interested in. That’s the food supply chain. USDA, obviously, is integrally involved, intimately involved in the food supply chain. We’ve worked with all of those producers, even the ones who provide the equipment and materials for our farmers and cattlemen and producers out there to make sure they have what they need. They’re a part of the critical and essential workforce there to continue, and the good news is those folks are staying on the job. Those who’ve grown it, those who are processing it, our inspectors who are grading it just the same way they always had, those folks who are delivering it, packing it, delivering it, stocking those shelves, and checking out those customers."
2020-03-27,01:20:39,Sonny Perdue,"That’s the great news about our food supply chain, and it’s a great American story. Mr. Vice President, under your leadership, the President’s leadership, this is that whole of America approach. Federal government can’t do it all, but we’ve got great partners out there in the food supply chain as well as our food nutrition services and our partners in our school nutrition services, doing a great job to continue to get these meals to kids there."
2020-03-27,01:21:06,Sonny Perdue,"Two of our private sector partners are here with us today. I’d like for them to tell their story, because it’s a great story. Denton McLane with McLane Global here has partnered with Baylor, a collaborative on poverty and hunger, along with PepsiCo in order to pack a million meals a week to deliver to rural kids, who might not can get to town to these drop-off sites, where the other kids are picking up meals. Again, Niren Chaudhary of Panera Bread, CEO of Panera Bread, their company is also participating in Columbus, Ohio with the Children Hunger Alliance there to deliver food meals that meet the regulations of USDA under flexible conditions there to get food meals there. Panera is looking to expand that to nationwide as well. So Denton, why don’t you come and tell us your story? Thank you very much."
2020-03-27,01:22:12,Denton McLane,"Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Secretary Perdue, and Secretary DeVoss. Right now, there’s a lot of focus on our large cities and the enormous challenges that they face, but imagine this. You live in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, or you live in the Nome Borough in Alaska. Your schools are closed, and normally, your children get two meals a day at school. Both parents are working from home, but Mom and Dad just can’t get to town, where meals are being offered for pickup."
2020-03-27,01:22:46,Denton McLane,"That’s about to change and change for the better. Because of this USDA program, McLane Global will source, secure, receive, organize, assemble, package, label, and then deliver boxes straight to a child’s home. Here’s another big difference. For the first time, we’ll be able to offer shelf-stable meals that will last two weeks. That’s a true game-changer for rural families. It’s happening because of the President’s order to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Everyone knows that tons of paperwork can be like lighter fluid for a great idea, and this is a great idea. We field tested it in 2019, and it worked."
2020-03-27,01:23:26,Denton McLane,"You’ve heard today about the administration’s work on this project. Here’s some other important partners in this effort. We have Baylor University. They will provide sponsorship and oversight. In addition, we are deeply appreciative to UPS and the United States Postal Service, and we are joined by PepsiCo company to help get this accomplished."
2020-03-27,01:23:47,Denton McLane,"Because of this collaboration and our tireless employees, I can report to you the boxes are ready to ship. After all, this is all about the children who must be fed during this crisis. We stand ready to serve. Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for caring about the specific needs for the children who live in rural America. Thank you."
2020-03-27,01:24:11,Sonny Perdue,"I want to welcome Niren Chaudhary, CEO of Panera Bread."
2020-03-27,01:24:20,Niren Chaudhary,"Good evening. Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for your leadership. It’s an honor to be here, and I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity. This is an extraordinary time, and I passionately believe that, at such times, we must all come together and do our very, very best to contribute and make a difference."
2020-03-27,01:24:45,Niren Chaudhary,"At Panera, our mission is simple. It is about ensuring that good food is accessible to everyone, especially those who are the most vulnerable, such as children, and especially at a time like this. We are absolutely determined to make a difference in this regard."
2020-03-27,01:25:05,Niren Chaudhary,"Today, we are announcing a partnership with USDA and Children’s Hunger Alliance to serve freshly prepared, wholesome meals to children in the entire state of Ohio to begin with, and hopefully, after that, we’ll expand that program across many of the states in the country."
2020-03-27,01:25:25,Niren Chaudhary,"I do believe that the human experience, indeed, life is all about having resilience in the face of adversity and also having the tenacity to just keep going, to just keep going. At Panera, our associates and our franchise partners live that spirit every single day. They’re resilient, and they’re tenacious. On their behalf, I pledge that we are committed to do the right thing for the country and help serve those who need it the most. At this very important time, we are ready to serve. Thank you very much."
2020-03-27,01:26:09,Mike Pence,"Outstanding. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you for your business’s incredible generosity, and I’ll actually allow the two business leaders to step out, if you’d like. We appreciate you so very much, on behalf of the President and a grateful nation."
2020-03-27,01:26:27,Mike Pence,"Before we go to questions, I’m going to invite Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauchi to step forward with a few reflections on what we’re seeing in the data. As you all are aware, over the next several days, our team will be assembling recommendations for the President to give further guidance to the American people, to states around the country, and they can both share with you the importance of ongoing efforts of mitigation by every American, the need to support what state and local leaders’ guidance is to every American community, but also, as Dr. Birx continues to work carefully with the modeling, analyzing the data, she’ll reflect on the progress that’s been made in that. Deborah?"
2020-03-27,01:27:12,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Great. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Just to pick up on some of the questions that you had earlier, so the issues that we discussed with the modeling yesterday was to ensure that the models were adjusted for the great work that every citizen is making in doing the mitigation efforts and to see if that was reflected in the requests specifically for ventilators."
2020-03-27,01:27:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So we wanted to make sure that, with a limited number of ventilators and the issues that we saw in Detroit and Dearborn, in Cook County, and now in New Orleans, that we were balancing and projecting correctly, based on both what the models had predicted and then whether they were adjusted for the incredible mitigation work ongoing in New York City."
2020-03-27,01:27:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We understand that this week and next week will not reflect that mitigation, whether it’s New Orleans or whether it’s New York and the New York metro area. We know that the hospital admissions that we are seeing this week and next week will be infections that occurred before the mitigation started, but we wanted to make sure, going forward, that the needs reflected that."
2020-03-27,01:28:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That was what was adjusted in the Ferguson model for the UK, and I know you’re following that very carefully. They believe strongly that the mitigation methods that were put into place that informed our mitigation methods, we all were working off of that same model, and I want to make it clear that those models, those flu models have been incredibly helpful to really predict what would layering of these different mitigation efforts, from social distancing to staying home if you’re sick, the staying in that household, the quarantine everybody in the household if anyone is positive."
2020-03-27,01:28:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Now, there are other countries that took different approaches, and I want to be clear, because we did hear from both China and South Korea. But it’s always important that you adopt and adapt and adapt it to your community and the reality of your country. We do this around the world. You can’t ever just take an off-the-shelf approach and then put it into action in your community. You have to understand your communities."
2020-03-27,01:29:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, although both China and South Korea removed people who were positive from their households and segregated them away from their families, we did not think that our Americans would adopt and adapt to that situation. So that’s why, in our guidelines, we asked people, if there is a family member, to try to self-isolate in the household so that that person is still there in the household."
2020-03-27,01:29:48,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I just wanted to be clear that, yes, we all heard about what China and South Korea did. As much as we could, we adapted them to the American situation, as the UK has done also. We just wanted to make and really ensure that all of the requests for the stockpile reflected the great work that the American citizens were doing in each of these areas to ensure health."
2020-03-27,01:30:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Then, finally, there was the question about requiring quarantine. I want to make sure that everyone understood when we talked about New York residents who had gone to other places, it was for them to voluntarily self-isolate and take care of themselves, because we felt like they could be exposed, and we really wanted to alert them that the rates in New York City were high and were increasing and that they were probably exposed during some of the most exposure time period before the mitigation efforts went in."
2020-03-27,01:30:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So this was really about the health of our New York citizens that then chose to go to other places, both to protect themselves and to protect others. So, hopefully, that’s clear to everyone about those issues. We continue to look at the data every day. We really want to applaud the laboratory testing that is helping us. It will help us very much when we can get full surveillance up in many of our communities and surveillance around those most vulnerable, particularly in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, so that we can more rapidly test both the workers and the occupants in those communities. Thank you."
2020-03-27,01:31:24,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Today, just a few hours ago, I had the opportunity to get on a telephone call with the people who are on the front lines, the people who are actually in the ICUs or in the hospitals from all of the areas that are being hardly hit, including New York."
2020-03-27,01:31:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I’m not a supply person. I’m a physician, a scientist. I do vaccines and I do drugs, but I am a member of the task force, and I do take very seriously the responsibility that we have to those individuals to get them the material that they need. We’ve heard discussions about the ventilators, personal protective equipment, masks, and things like that."
2020-03-27,01:32:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"They are doing an amazing job up there, and I just want to have a message to them, which I told them over the phone, that, as a member of the task force, with my colleagues here, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that they get everything they need at the time that they need that, because they are doing an amazing job up there, and I salute them. Thank you."
2020-03-27,01:32:24,Mike Pence,Great. We’ll take a few questions.
2020-03-27,01:32:27,Audience,"Just a quick one to Dr. Birx, please. I asked you, I think it was about eight or nine days, about the data from all these tests, and you had suggested that there would soon be a website where we would see all the data. Are we closer to that? When do you expect that? Do you have any data to give us tonight? As far as I can tell, this has not been publicly released yet."
2020-03-27,01:32:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah. No, thank you. I’ve learned, and as Tony has described, we’ve learned that when a community is educated, we all do better together, and so it’s important to get that information out when we start talking about where the virus is, what the percent positives are, and really inform communities so that they can make decisions, so that people can take protective measures for themselves and for their families."
2020-03-27,01:33:12,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I find that it’s important, yes, for us to have the data, but it’s equally important for the state and local governments, as well as the communities. We are still, because we worked very hard to get it into the first bill, but it was changed to state and local labs, and, obviously, 95% of all the tests are being done in the commercial labs. So in this recent bill that was just approved, it is mandated that all commercial labs need to report. So you’ll have that data when we get the data comprehensively from all the commercial labs. Well, it was passed today, so hopefully we’ll expect it tomorrow."
2020-03-27,01:33:51,Moderator,One more question.
2020-03-27,01:33:53,Audience,"Dr. Fauci … [inaudible 01:33:55] Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, whomever, I guess what is the testing standard here? Are you going to need to test people who are well or only people who are symptomatic? Obviously, let’s say in Omaha, ten people walk into a hospital. Five come in. They’re all tested positive. Five go home. They may still be positive. What is your standard in order to make these recommendations?"
2020-03-27,01:34:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I’m glad you asked, because the important thing about testing, it only tells you if you’re positive or negative that day. You could become positive the next day. So testing should be used intentionally as a surveillance tool or a diagnostic tool, and I think what we are going to work on over the weekend is to weave together both a testing strategy for surveillance, which you have brought up in that key point, while maintaining a strong testing for diagnosis, because our first obligation is still to ensure that patients get diagnosed, both so that the personal protective equipment for those who are negative doesn’t have to be utilized, but also to give those patients the opportunity to have optimal care. I think Dr. Fauchi mentioned this a few minutes ago. The things we have learned over the last just three months was a lot of information about how best to ventilate patients. I think that has been shared across communities and across clinicians around the globe. We’d never previously had an experience where a lot of people had to be ventilated prone."
2020-03-27,01:35:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So this kind of information that has been shared has been critical to improve the survival of the patients that we have in the United States of America, and we really want to applaud the countries who have been giving all of us that information and sharing it across the clinical network."
2020-03-27,01:35:37,Audience,"I’d like to put it to Dr. Fauci, if I could. Dr. Fauci, Sunday will mark one month since the first death from this new disease. I wanted to ask you a bit of a philosophical question. I’ve known you for 25 years. You’ve been through HIV/AIDS, MERS, SARS, West Nile virus, Ebola, all of that. How has this nation changed since that first death one month ago?"
2020-03-27,01:36:00,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, this is truly an unprecedented situation that we’re going through. As you mentioned correctly, John, I have been through everything from the very beginning of the very uncertain days with HIV/AIDS. Cumulatively, if you look at what’s happened with HIV/AIDS over the 37 and a half, 38 years that we’ve had it, the burden and the suffering and the death has been enormous, historic, but it came over a period of time. There was the fright in the beginning."
2020-03-27,01:36:31,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What we’re seeing now, in actual, real time, is something that’s unprecedented. This is something that we have never seen before, at least in our generation. They’ve seen something maybe like this back 100 years ago, and we’re really being challenged to not only learn in real time, to be able to respond in a way that is helpful and effective, but we’re also in uncharted waters. I think that’s the thing that I find different, is that the waters are uncharted so that it isn’t as if we have an example of how to do it. We have an extraordinary confrontation on the health and the welfare of the globe, particularly for us here in the United States. So as somebody who has been through all of those outbreaks, this truly is unprecedented. So from the first day to now, the first death, we’ve been through something that no one has ever experienced in our generation."
2020-03-27,01:37:34,Mike Pence,"Let me say good evening to each one of you. I trust this was helpful. We’ll continue to keep you informed. Over the course of the weekend, the President will be traveling to Norfolk for the embarkation of the US Navy ship Comfort. Our task force will be meeting through the course of the weekend, and we’ll be reviewing the data and preparing recommendations for the American people, going forward. But thank you all for your time and attention."
2020-03-29,01:35,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate everybody being here. Beautiful day in the rose garden. Tremendous distance between chairs, social distancing. You practice it very well. We appreciate it. That’s great. I want to start today by highlighting several critical developments on both the testing and treatment that will help us win our war against the coronavirus. On Friday, the FDA authorized a new test developed by Abbott Labs that delivers lightening fast results in as little as five minutes, and it’s a whole new ballgame. I want to thank Abbott Labs for the incredible work they’ve done. They’ve been working around the clock. Normally this approval process from the FDA would take 10 months and even longer, but we did it in four weeks. Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day starting this weekend. As you know, even before this development, we’ve been doing more tests than any other country anywhere in the world."
2020-03-29,02:49,Donald Trump,"It’s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we’ve been testing. It’s also one of the reasons that we’re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we’ve been doing more testing so we have bigger numbers to look at. I want to also thank General Seminite out of the Army Corps of Engineers and general Paul Acheck who’s here with us, who’s going to say a few words in a little while. What the Army Corps of Engineers did along with FEMA in New York was incredible. They built 2,900 beds worth of hospital, an incredible hospital in the Javits Center, which I know well, and I just want to say that was unreal. They did it in less than four days. People have never seen anything like that, and it’s an incredible, complex, top of the line hospital. They did it so quickly."
2020-03-29,03:48,Donald Trump,"Everyone’s trying to figure out how they did it, including me and I was a good builder, but they did it very quickly, Mike. So we’re very, we’re very happy. So I want to thank army Corps of engineers, FEMA, the incredible job they have done now they’re moving to other locations throughout the country where they already have people building hospitals. We’re doing them in Louisiana and New Jersey, many, many other places. But these are incredible men and women and they worked around the clock and the people of New York are very happy. Governor Cuomo expressed his thanks, which we appreciate, but these are … I mean, nobody could have done a job like that. Most people have never seen anything like it. The deployment of rapid testing will vastly accelerate our ability to monitor, track, contained, and ultimately defeat the virus. We will defeat the virus. It will also allow us to test doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers immediately and enable us to act quickly and aggressively to shut down the spread of the virus, so important in critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes."
2020-03-29,04:58,Donald Trump,"We will ensure that we can give cities and states the best information to guide local decision makers in making. I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients, people in New York along with the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin, and it’s very early yet. It’s only … It started two days ago, but we will see what happens. I want to thank Steven Hahn, who’s a great doctor. Left one of the best jobs in our country running an incredible hospital in Texas, and he’s the head of the FDA and Steven got approval for that so fast. Let’s see how it works. It may, it may not, but we may have some incredible results. We’re going to know soon. So it’s tested … It’s being tested on 1,100 people in New York. The FDA is also allowing the emergency use of a blood-related therapy called convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for seriously ill patients."
2020-03-29,06:10,Donald Trump,"This treatment involves taking blood plasma from patients who have already recovered from the virus, so they’re recovered, they’re strong, something was good in them that worked, and so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well, meaning their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus and transfusing it into sick patients, very, very, very powerfully. So sick patients will be transfused with the blood taken to boost their immune system. We’ll see what happens and we’re having some early results that are good, but we will see, and that’s going, I think, very rapidly. Again, we got approvals in really very quick time. We’re also looking at an approval for the sterilization of masks. I kept saying to myself … I’ve seen some of the masks are very complex. We’re delivering millions by the way, millions, but I kept saying, “Why aren’t they able to use that mask a second, third, fourth time?”"
2020-03-29,07:17,Donald Trump,"Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio called me, they have a company that is in the final process of getting approval for the sterilization of masks and in some cases, depending on the mask, some of these masks are very, very strong, very powerful, very strong material. They’re able to sterilize the mask up to 20 times. So that’s, I guess, like getting 20 masks. And so we worked on that. As soon as I heard from Mike today, I got involved and the FDA is now involved and we’re trying to get a fast approval for the sterilization of masks. That would be a tremendous difference. It would be really helpful. While much of the research has to be done, we have a lot of research left to do obviously, this treatment on plasma has shown promising results in other countries. We’re in communication with other countries, very strong communications and they’re very reliant on us in just about all cases."
2020-03-29,08:19,Donald Trump,"We have the greatest people in the world. They’re very, very anxious to find out how we’re doing on our different things, whether it’s a cure or whether it’s really anything having to do with getting people better. We have some interesting things will be announced I think over the next few weeks, but we’ll see what happens. They’re being tested right now. The vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer, but I’d like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick, and we’re working on that at a level that people would be amazed. These are incredible people. They don’t stop. This method also has been used for more than a century, and that’s the blood-related therapy. More than a century to fight off infectious diseases. So it’s not unusual."
2020-03-29,09:18,Donald Trump,"Our level of complexity has changed, but it’s a concept that’s been used for a long time, including during the Spanish Flu epidemic, and that was really a pandemic of proportions like, frankly, nobody’s seen until what we’re facing now. That was in 1918. You know what the result of that was, probably from 75 to 100 million people were killed and also other viruses like the one in this outbreak. This is a very tough one. This is a tough one because it spread so quickly, like nothing we’ve seen. It spread so easily, so quickly. We’re unleashing every tool in our nation’s vast arsenal, economic, if you look, medical and scientific, military. Homeland Security is a working very, very hard with all of them in order to vanquish the virus. As you know, every level of government, state, local and federal is working nonstop to obtain more personal protective equipment for frontline workers, we’re delivering vast orders of this material. I’m going to ask a couple of the people here to join me that both make it and deliver it."
2020-03-29,10:40,Donald Trump,"Joining us today are the leaders of America’s largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment including McKesson, Cardinal health, Henry Schein, Owens and Minor, Medline, FedEx and UPS. We just concluded a very productive meeting about ways to keep our supply chains and delivery systems moving at top speed. And maybe I’d like to just ask for a couple of minutes for Mike Coffman to come up and maybe Ed Pesicka. Mike is with Cardinal and Ed is Owen and Minor, but I and I appreciate it and if anybody else has anything, please come up. But if you could come up Mike for a second and Ed for a second, just you could maybe say what you told me before when we had the meeting. Thank you."
2020-03-29,11:25,Unnamed,"Thank you mister president. And thanks for your leadership on this. Because of that leadership. We have really seen the government agencies working with industry like no time before. We’ve seen HHS, FEMA, the CDC work incredibly effectively with all of the distributors, and all of the distributors working together for the good of the people. And all of us have been so focused on making sure that we take care of customers, because our customers are the ones that are taking care of the patients every day and we need to do everything we can to make things good for them. And so it’s been great to see how well all these government agencies have been coordinating together with us."
2020-03-29,12:06,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-03-29,12:06,Unnamed,Appreciate it.
2020-03-29,12:11,Unnamed,"Thank you mister president. Let me first start by thanking the administration for all the support that you’ve provided to the industry. One of the things we did, we did hear the challenge and starting in January we’ve ramped up our production in the Americas, including our facility in North Carolina where we are now manufacturing an additional 40 to 50 million masks per month to get into the US healthcare system. And we talked a little about this in the pre-meeting. One of the issues we’re struggling with is the demand increase. I used an anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly 10 to 20,000 masks a week, are now using two to 300,000 mass a week. So you multiply that times the entire US, let alone the same demand outside of the US, that’s part of the issue we’re running into, is even with a significant ramp up in supply, there’s still that demand that is much greater than that supply."
2020-03-29,13:00,Donald Trump,Thank you very much.
2020-03-29,13:01,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-03-29,13:03,Donald Trump,"And I bring that up because when we discussed back in a room, we were in a conference room. Very nice one, actually. It’s called the cabinet room. That statement was made that they’ve been delivering for years, 10 to 20,000 masks. Okay. It’s a New York hospital. It’s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20 to 300,000? 10 to 20,000 masks, to 300,000. even though this is different, something’s going on. And you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So somebody should probably look into that, because I just don’t see from a practical standpoint how that’s possible to go from that to that. And we have that happening in numerous places. Not to that extent. That was the highest number I’ve heard. That’s the highest number you’ve seen, I would imagine. Right? But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals."
2020-03-29,14:11,Donald Trump,"He knows the system better than anybody. And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number. So thank you very much. I hope I didn’t get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York. FEMA is working with these companies to launch Project Airbridge to expedite the movement of critical supplies from other countries to the United States. The first flight arrived at JFK Airport, New York this morning, filled with 80 tons of personal protective equipment including 130,000 N95 respirators. Those are the ones that we were talking about before. 1.8 million face masks and gowns, 10.3 million gloves and many other things, millions and millions of different items. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights and is adding more daily. We hope to have about 50 flights. We’re going to have, I think including the one that came in today, we’re up at 51 flights with these massive planes from the different companies that was so nice to be here today. Would you like to say something on behalf? Please come up. Thank you."
2020-03-29,15:25,Unnamed,"Thank you mister president for the incredible leadership. I will share with you that UPS is really proud to be part of this effort. Vice President Pence and I had the opportunity to speak before and the way we’re going to win this war is with great logistics, and UPS is going to be part of that effort. We have a big brown army, 495,000 UPSers across the country that are ready to deliver. We’re bringing in the supplies from anywhere around the world as fast as we can so that they can serve the communities that need them most. We’re proud to be partnering with the states as well, because we know that in partnership with those states we can deliver what is needed everywhere, so thank you mister president."
2020-03-29,16:02,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Great job you’re doing.
2020-03-29,16:03,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-03-29,16:04,Donald Trump,Please. Thank you very much.
2020-03-29,16:13,Unnamed,"Thank you mister president. I would certainly like to echo my colleagues comments that the collaboration amongst many of the government agencies and the private market, the distributors represented here today has been incredible. It has been increasing and ramping up over the past weeks. Today’s first delivery of Operation Airbridge I think is the first evidence that it’s working. The 51 flights you referenced we’re excited about. We look to build upon that. So I would echo my thanks for your leadership and certainly to the staffs for the terrific partnership and the commitment to protect the people we think about most often, which are the people on the front lines providing care. And maybe just a quick word of thanks on behalf of all the CEOs here to our teams that continue to show up in warehouses across the country and pharmacies across the country and do their jobs to keep the supply chain going. The supply chain is working, it’s resilient. Supply is a challenge. We’re tackling that."
2020-03-29,17:16,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Great job.
2020-03-29,17:23,Unnamed,"Thank you. Thank you mister president and thanks to a FEMA and HHS. I think great leadership is really working well. The demand has skyrocketed and we’re doing a lot of things to bring in more masks, more other protective apparel. We are involved in reprocessing masks and we’ve already started at about 100,000 masks per day and we hope to expand from there. So we’re quite optimistic about it."
2020-03-29,17:54,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-03-29,17:54,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-03-29,17:55,Donald Trump,Fantastic job. Anybody else if you want? Yes please. You did such a great job. [inaudible 00:00:18:04].
2020-03-29,18:05,Unnamed,"Thank you. Thank you mister president. We appreciate the opportunity to work with your administration on a lot of collaborative fronts. Number one, we’ve all talked about PE products. That’s critical and it’s not just to the hospitals, that’s a must, but it’s really to all healthcare providers out there working on the front line. So our commitment is there to get it to the hotspots and get it to the care providers that are taking care of those patients. It’s absolutely key. Second, we talked in there about buying in America and getting resources back here and manufacturing in America. That is critical, a lesson to be learned from where we are. And lastly, we’re proud that we introduced a test. We need to get some more tests out there in a rapid form. We’re excited about that. We’ve worked with your administration very closely in the FDA and we’re very grateful for that, because it’s a quick rapid antibody tests that’s needed as well. So we’re really proud to work with the administration [inaudible 00:18:47]. Thanks so much."
2020-03-29,18:47,Donald Trump,"Thank you. So thank you all very much and for the great job you’re doing. It’s really incredible, frankly. Many of the States are stocked up. Some of them don’t admit it, but we have sent just so much, so many things to them and including ventilators. There’s a question as to hoarding of ventilators. Some hospitals and independent hospitals and some hospital chains as we call them, they are holding ventilators. They don’t want to let them up. We need them for certain areas where there’s big problems. We can’t hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road. So we’ve delivered a lot in this group has been really fantastic. We want to thank you, and UPS and FedEx in particular. You’ve gone absolutely out of your way. So we appreciate everything you’ve done and delivered. The federal government continues to mobilize every resource to make sure our frontline doctors and nurses have the equipment needed to save American lives."
2020-03-29,19:51,Donald Trump,"Yesterday I visited naval station Norfolk as the USNS comfort departed for New York three weeks ahead of schedule, fully loaded with 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds and hundreds of the best doctors, nurses, and medical professionals anywhere in the United States Navy, anywhere, frankly, in the United States. It was an incredible thing to see. Mostly you saw that on television as it was leaving. It left literally three weeks early. It was under a maintenance and they got the maintenance done very quickly. They worked around the clock as many of the people have and it was a great site. Additionally, two of the country’s largest health insurers, Humana and Cigna are announcing that they will waive copays, which is a big deal for anybody that understands insurance. They don’t waive copays too easily, but we’ve asked them to do it and they’ve done it. Coinsurance and deductibles for the coronavirus treatments to help ease the financial burden on American families during this pandemic, so they’re waiving copays, coinsurance, and deductibles."
2020-03-29,20:59,Donald Trump,"Nobody’s … I don’t think anyone’s heard of that one. Have you heard of that one before? I haven’t heard. I want to thank them. Great companies. Today I spoke with Wolfgang Puck. Wolfgang Puck is a great restaurateur as you know, as is John George and Thomas Keller and Daniel Ballou and other leaders in the restaurant business, which has been probably one of the hardest hit industries. I have directed my staff to use any and all authority available to give restaurants, bars, clubs, incentives to stay open. You’re going to lose all these restaurants and they’re not going to make it back and they have to get going. So what I’m doing is I’m going to tell Secretary Mnuchen and also our great secretary of labor, who you know very well, to immediately start looking into the restoring of the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations that set the restaurant business back a lot when it was done originally, and then done not so long ago."
2020-03-29,22:05,Donald Trump,"We’re going to go to deductibility so that companies can send people to restaurants. I think it’ll have a tremendous impact and maybe keep them open. And I mean, don’t forget, some are closing right now, despite the fact that they could be open in the not too distant future and we expect that, but there are some that aren’t going to be able to get open, and we want to make sure they do. So we’re going to look at the restoration, restoring the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations so the corporations can send people to restaurants and take a deduction on it like they did in the old days. That was when restaurants were doing really well. The financial relief bill I signed on Friday provided historical relief for American workers and small businesses and includes $350 billion in job restoration and retention. So if you look at job retention loans for small businesses, that’s a big deal, with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying the work."
2020-03-29,23:03,Donald Trump,"– With loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers, so it’s $350 billion job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying workers. I mean, how about that? $300 billion in direct cash payments are being sent to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year, $3400 for the typical family of four, so they’ll be getting a check for $3400 for the typical family of four. Approximately $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. Under this plan, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months. The bill provides for these unemployment checks to be delivered through the existing state unemployment systems. Not us, state."
2020-03-29,23:54,Donald Trump,"I was opposed to this method because many of the states have very antiquated computer systems that are 45 years old, and they’re not prepared to handle this kind of distribution, this kind of money coming in so quickly. They’re not set up for that, and I didn’t want to do it, but our opponents wanted it, so we did it, and if they don’t get their money fast, I’m going to ask that we convene the federal government, that we come back to Congress and we’ll do something where we take care of it, because we can take care of it very easily and quickly, and I said that, but a lot of these systems are so old and so antiquated at the state level that they’re going, they have the money, they’re going to get the money very quickly, but they’re not going to be able to distribute it, so remember what I said, and we will, if we have to, call Congress back or find some other way of delivery of the money."
2020-03-29,24:48,Donald Trump,"Throughout this great national struggle the American people have embodied the unrivaled patriotism and willpower that has led America to conquer every challenge, every single one, in our nation’s history. More than 90% of Americans say they are staying home as much as possible, putting their lives, their careers, their educations, and their dreams on hold out of devotion to their fellow citizens, and to their country. Social distancing, that’s the way you win. These shared sacrifices are pulling our nation together like never before. Family bonds are strengthening, neighbors are looking after neighbors, it’s incredible. I’m seeing, you’re seeing, everybody’s seeing what’s happening. Communities are rallying for the cause, and old divisions are fading away. The Americans of every background are uniting to help our nation in this hour of need."
2020-03-29,25:44,Donald Trump,"It’s up to 151 countries, so when we say our nation, our nation and the world, when you think. Think of it, 151 countries. Somebody said to me today that wasn’t in this particular world, they didn’t know that we had that many countries. 151 countries, that’s something. Some are struggling at a level that nobody would have believed possible. If you look at Italy, if you look at, France is having big problems, Spain is having incredible problems. Something we did very well is, when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level, that was a good thing to do. Great thing to do. We would have thousands and thousands of more deaths, and we also stopped the inflow from Europe at a very early level, but those things were very important, especially the initial one, because we had never done anything like it, where we closed our borders to a country like that."
2020-03-29,26:43,Donald Trump,"The modeling put together by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and our other top healthcare exp-, I mean, we have, and these people are amazing, the healthcare experts who, in this country, are the best in the world, they demonstrate that the mitigation measures we are putting in place may significantly reduce the number of new infections and ultimately the number of fatalities. I want the American people to know that your selfless, inspiring, and valiant efforts are saving countless lives. You’re making the difference. The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks, so I’ll say it again: the peak, the highest point of death rates, remember this, is likely to hit in two weeks. Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all. Therefore, the next two weeks, and during this period it’s very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines, have to follow the guidelines that our great vice president holds up a lot. He’s holding that up a lot. He believes in it so strongly."
2020-03-29,28:06,Donald Trump,"The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end. Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30th to slow the spread. On Tuesday, we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings, supporting data, and strategy to the American people. So we’ll be having lots of meetings in between, but we’ll be having a very important statement made on Tuesday, probably Tuesday evening, on all of the findings, all of the data, and the reasons we’re doing things the way we’re doing them. We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery. We think by June 1st, a lot of great things will be happening."
2020-03-29,29:02,Donald Trump,"I want every citizen in our country to take heart and confidence in the fact that we have the best medical minds in the world tackling this disease. We have the best science, the best researchers, and the best talent anywhere working night and day to protect your family and loved ones and to overcome this pandemic. With the grace of God, we are rising to the occasion. We are proving that no darkness can overshadow the eternal light of American courage. We will win, and when we do, we will rebound with astonishing force and speed. We will be stronger than ever, and we will have learned so much, where something like this can never hurt us to the extent it has, and the world, again."
2020-03-29,29:50,Donald Trump,"In our present crisis, the strength of our people is our single most important asset, and together we will defeat this invisible curse, this invisible enemy, and rise to incredible new heights. So I just want to thank you all for being here, and we’ll take some questions if you’d like, yeah. Please. Kelly."
2020-03-29,30:13,Kelly,"Mr. President, Dr. Fauci said that he thought could be in excess of a million cases in the United States, and deaths could exceed 100,000. Do you accept that assessment, and has that formed your thinking about extending these guidelines? You also talked about New York. Were you suggesting there has been inappropriate use of masks or improper conduct with supplies?"
2020-03-29,30:36,Donald Trump,"No, I want the people in New York to check Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, that when a hospital that’s getting 10,000 masks goes to 300,000 masks during the same period, and that’s a rapid period, I would like them to check that, because I hear stories like that all the time. We’re delivering millions and millions of different products, and all we do is hear, “Can you get some more?” But when you hear that, and I heard that from one of the great companies of the world, that doing this, it’s a client, and they’re going from, you heard it, 10,000, 20,000 tops, to 300,000, and that’s a hospital that’s always full, so I think people should check that, because there’s something going on. I don’t think it’s hoarding, I think it’s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out."
2020-03-29,31:27,Kelly,What do you think [inaudible 00:31:28]?
2020-03-29,31:28,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. I don’t know. I think that’s for other people to figure out, but you don’t go from numbers like that. Now, other equipment likewise, because we’re delivering a lot of ventilators, and we’re building, by the way, we’re building and buying. We have a lot of ventilators that we’re going to be sending out very soon. We also have, right now, in the stockpile, almost 10,000 ventilators that we have to hold in case of emergency. We don’t want them going out and then Louisiana has a tremendous problem, which we now know they do. All of a sudden it came, very quickly. Louisiana was doing so fantastically well, then all of a sudden there was a big rash of cases, so we have to be prepared to move the ventilators. They’re very important pieces of equipment. They’re very expensive, and they’re very complex. It’s like building a car. These are expensive, complicated, very complicated pieces of equipment."
2020-03-29,32:23,Donald Trump,"So we now have 10,000, and we inherited a system which was broken, just like, I’ll never forget the day when a general came and said, “Sir,” my first week in office, “We have no ammunition.” That was in the military. We’ve now rebuilt our military, stronger than it’s ever been, and we have so much ammunition. You wouldn’t believe it how much ammunition we have, but same thing here. We had a stockpile that was deficient. We had testing that was no good. We had a testing situation that just wasn’t right. It was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken and it was only good for a very small situation, but what I’d like to do is I’d like to ask Dr. Fauci to come forward and discuss the number, because I think the number is going to be a very different number than the numbers that you talked about. Please, Doctor. You might talk about that."
2020-03-29,33:19,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, the number I gave out is based on modeling, and I think it’s entirely conceivable that, if we do not mitigate to the extent that we’re trying to do, that you could reach that number."
2020-03-29,33:34,Kelly,"100,00 deaths?"
2020-03-29,33:35,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah. It’s possible. You can make a big soundbite about it, but the fact is, it’s possible. What we’re trying to do is not let that happen, so instead of concentrating on the upper and the lower, we’re saying that we’re trying to push it all the way down. But the second part of your question was, yes, we feel that the mitigation that we’re doing right now is having an effect. It’s very difficult to quantitate it, because you have two dynamic things going on at the same time. You have the virus going up, and you have the mitigation trying to push it down, but the decision to prolong, not prolong, but to extend this mitigation process until the end of April I think was a wise and prudent decision."
2020-03-29,34:16,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Dr. Birx and I spent a considerable amount of time going over all the data, why we felt this was a best choice of us, and the president accepted it, so in direct answer to your question, the idea that we may have this many cases played a role in our decision in trying to make sure that we don’t do something prematurely and pull back when we should be pushing."
2020-03-29,34:39,Unnamed,Mr. President? Mr. President?
2020-03-29,34:39,Donald Trump,"Deborah, please. Would you, can you explain the 2.2 million if we did nothing, because a lot of people would like to know that."
2020-03-29,34:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah. So thank you. You all know, we’ve all, you’ve all seen the models. You’ve seen the models from Imperial, you’ve seen the models from Columbia. We’ve reviewed 12 different models, and then we went back to the drawing board over the last week or two and worked from the ground up utilizing actual reporting of cases. It’s the way we built the HIV model, the TB model, the malaria model. When we finished, the other group that was working in parallel, which we didn’t know about, HIME, and Chris Murray, ended up at the same numbers. So if you go on his website, you can see the concern that we had with the growing number of potential fatalities. All of the flu models predicted anywhere between 1.6 and 2.2 million fatalities if we didn’t mitigate. I think you all knew those numbers."
2020-03-29,35:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Some of them predicted half of the United States would get infected and have that level of mortality, so we worked very hard together to really look at all of the impacts of the different mitigations that have been utilized around the world, and use that evidence base to really bring that data and that evidence to the President to consider for extending, which is not a simple situation when you ask people to say home for another 30 days, so they have to know that we really built this on scientific evidence and the potential to save hundreds of thousands of American lives, and we know that’s a huge sacrifice for everyone. We know it’s a sacrifice for every mother and child and father who’s also self-isolating. There are people that have to go out to work, and we know the compromises that they’re making, but it’s all to protect not only Americans, but the healthcare providers. The healthcare providers that are on the front lines, and you’ve seen them, and you’ve seen how difficult this has been."
2020-03-29,36:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’re really working, there will be a comprehensive piece presented on Tuesday that really talks about not only diagnosing individuals, but also increasing our surveillance, now that we have more test kits, so that we can really stop and contain new infections at the same time we’re really dedicating test kits still to the critical diagnosis, so that people can get the treatment that they want, and so that we can ensure, when people come to the hospital, that they know that the nurses and the doctors and the equipment that they need will be there to serve them, because together, as Americans, we’re going to bring down the number of infections so we don’t have 2.2 million deaths or 1.6 million deaths, but really work very hard to keep this in its lowest numbers we possibly can."
2020-03-29,37:31,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-03-29,37:32,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-03-29,37:32,Unnamed,Mr. President.
2020-03-29,37:33,Donald Trump,"I just want to reiterate, because a lot of people have been asking, well, what would have happened if we did nothing? Did nothing, we just rode it out, and I’ve been asking that question to Tony and Deborah, and they’ve been talking to me about it for a long time, other people have been asking that question, and I think we got our most accurate study today, or certainly most comprehensive. Think of the number, potentially, 2.2 million people if we did nothing. If we didn’t do the distancing, if we didn’t do all of the things that we’re doing. When you hear those numbers, you start to realize that, with the kind of work we went through last week, with the $2.2 trillion, it no longer sounds like a lot, right?"
2020-03-29,38:19,Donald Trump,"You’re talking about, when I heard the number today, first time I’ve heard that number, because I’ve been asking the same question that some people have been asking, I felt even better about what we did last week with the $2.2 trillion, because you’re talking about a potential of up to 2.2 million, and some people said it could even be higher than that. So you’re talking about 2.2 million deaths. 2.2 million people from this. If we can hold that down as we’re saying, to 100,000, it’s a horrible number. Maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100 and 200,000, we altogether have done a very good job. 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that? I’m feeling very good about what we did last week."
2020-03-29,39:12,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-03-29,39:12,Donald Trump,"Yes, please. Go ahead, please."
2020-03-29,39:16,Unnamed,"Mr. President, given that you’re announcing that you’re extending these guidelines, was floating Easter a mistake, do you think, and-"
2020-03-29,39:22,Donald Trump,No.
2020-03-29,39:24,Unnamed,"You can tell us why, and then-"
2020-03-29,39:24,Donald Trump,"It was just an aspiration. We actually will be hitting, potentially, this was with our meeting before, on Easter, that could be a peak. That could be a peak period. That could be the peak, sadly to say, that could be the peak number of deaths before it starts coming down. No, that was aspirational. We had an aspiration of Easter, but when you hear these kind of numbers and you hear the potential travesty, we don’t want to do anything where, you know, we don’t want to have it spike up. We don’t want to do it soon and then all of a sudden you go down, you’re coming down, and then you start going up again, because we discussed that could happen, and we don’t want that to happen. We’ve gone through too much."
2020-03-29,40:09,Donald Trump,"That was an aspirational number. I didn’t say “Easter.” I said, “It would be a great thing if we could do it by Easter,” and we know much more now than we knew two, three weeks ago. Easter should be the peak number and it should start coming down and hopefully very substantially from that point."
2020-03-29,40:25,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-03-29,40:25,Donald Trump,"Okay, thank you."
2020-03-29,40:25,Unnamed,Mr. President-
2020-03-29,40:25,Unnamed,Mr. President-
2020-03-29,40:25,Donald Trump,Please. OAN.
2020-03-29,40:31,Jenn Pellegrino,"Jenn Pellegrino with OAN. Thank you, sir. Mr. President, your approval ratings have been the highest they’ve ever been, as well as the ratings on your handling of the virus, yet there are some networks that are saying they’re debating whether or not to carry these briefings live. Do you think there’s a link between the two?"
2020-03-29,40:46,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t know. I know that, boy, that’s a nice question. Thank you very much. Yeah, I don’t want high approval ratings for this. I wish we could have our old life back. We had the greatest economy that we’ve ever had, and we didn’t have death. We didn’t have this. We didn’t have this horrible scourge, this plague, call it whatever you want. The virus. We’re working very hard, that’s all I know. I see things, I see numbers. They don’t matter to me. What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible. When you hear that 2.2 million people could have died if we didn’t go through all of this, and now the number will be a much lower number, hopefully it’s going to be the numbers that we’re talking about, so I appreciate it very much, but what I want is I want our life back again. I want our country back. I want the world back. I want the world to get rid of this. Again, 151 countries. And we’re going to do it. We’re going to have a great victory. We’re going to have a great victory."
2020-03-29,41:51,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Mr. President?"
2020-03-29,41:52,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-03-29,41:53,Unnamed,Sorry buddy.
2020-03-29,41:54,Unnamed,"Yeah, thanks."
2020-03-29,41:55,Unnamed,"You mentioned it, and I just wanted to make sure I was right. Humana and Cigna are going to waive, for all costs for anybody that’s got the coronavirus, they’re going to take care of everything?"
2020-03-29,42:03,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s what they said. I told you what they’re going to take, copays in particular, that’s a big deal. Insurance companies don’t do that, and I appreciate it. Humana and Cigna, they should be getting a lot of credit for that."
2020-03-29,42:14,Unnamed,"Will there be other companies, just those two-"
2020-03-29,42:17,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. Those two are getting a lot of credit right now for it, and they should, because it’s something that, it’s a lot of money they’re waiving. We thank them. Will there be other companies? I wouldn’t be surprised."
2020-03-29,42:29,Unnamed,"Are you calling on them to do it, sir?"
2020-03-29,42:30,Donald Trump,"This great spirit, I’ll tell you what. Yeah, I’d love to have them do it. Let them waive those copays. There’s a great spirit in this country right now. I know insurance companies better than anybody. They just don’t do that. But now there’s a spirit like I have not seen. I have never seen anything like it. Even the media is much more fair. I wouldn’t say all of it, but that’s okay. They should be fair, because they should want this to end. This is about death. So I wan to thank Cigna and Humana. Thank you."
2020-03-29,42:59,Unnamed,"Will the federal government be reimbursing those insurance companies, or is this something they really are just doing out of their pocketbooks?"
2020-03-29,43:05,Donald Trump,"They haven’t asked for reimbursement, so I assume they’re not. They said they’re going to waive them. Waiving them doesn’t mean we’re going to waive them and get reimbursed, no."
2020-03-29,43:11,Unnamed,"Okay. Second question for you, sir. First of the month is three days away. I know these cash payments are coming. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said today about three weeks, they should et there. For people that are worried about paying rent, I know mortgages through HUD is taken care of, but I’m just curious about rent. What should people be doing for the first of the month-"
2020-03-29,43:28,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re going to be getting the money. I will tell you, I think landlords are going to take it easy. We may put out a statement on that. I think a lot of people that are owed money is going to take it easy. They don’t sort of have a choice, but a lot of concessions are made, just like the insurance companies. A lot of concessions are being made that wouldn’t have even been thought of three weeks ago, not even thought of. So a lot of really positive things are happening. Please, behind you."
2020-03-29,43:55,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President. Yesterday, why did you publicly threaten a quarantine on New York, New Jersey, parts of Connecticut?"
2020-03-29,44:02,Donald Trump,"I didn’t do that at all. Read the statement. Read the statement. Read what I said. I said, “We’re going to look into possibly quarantine.” I didn’t say, “We’re going to quarantine.” I looked at it as a possibility, because a lot of our professionals suggested quarantine. I said, “We’re going to look at it.” We then looked at it, you see? Who are you with? Bloomberg, right? I can’t imagine that. Let me just tell you, I didn’t threaten it. I don’t go around threatening. What happened is people, professionals, very good professionals, love the idea of doing that, because that’s sort of the ultimate in distancing. You can’t do, they didn’t want New Yorkers, where they’re having a problem, necessarily going down to Florida, where they have less of a problem, so the concept of quarantine was thrown out to me, really would love to do it. They would love to do it, and I thought it was too much to do, because the people are doing a great job with it. Also, it’s very hard to enforce. Okay, please."
2020-03-29,44:57,Unnamed,"But by speaking about it publicly, by speaking about it publicly and letting it be known that it’s a consideration, do you think that you maybe frightened some Americans?"
2020-03-29,45:06,Donald Trump,"No, I think we made people aware to stay in your houses and do good. Now we did an advisory. It’s a strong advisory. The governors are running the advisory, the three governors. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and I think we did a great thing. All I did yesterday, as you know, you can see it, you can read it, you can read and you can see very simply that I said that we are looking into it, and then, before the end of the evening, substantially, we decided to go with the advisory, which, frankly, I liked better from the beginning. Go ahead."
2020-03-29,45:35,Yamiche Alcindor,"Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. The first is you’ve said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting they don’t actually need. You said New York might not need 30,000-"
2020-03-29,45:46,Donald Trump,I didn’t say that.
2020-03-29,45:47,Yamiche Alcindor,You said it on Sean Hannity’s Fox News. You said that you might-
2020-03-29,45:50,Donald Trump,"Why don’t you people act, let me ask you-"
2020-03-29,45:52,Yamiche Alcindor,You said some states-
2020-03-29,45:53,Donald Trump,Why don’t you act in a little more positive? It’s always trying to get you-
2020-03-29,45:57,Yamiche Alcindor,My question to you is-
2020-03-29,45:58,Donald Trump,"Get you, get you, and you know what? That’s why nobody trusts the media anymore."
2020-03-29,46:00,Yamiche Alcindor,My question to you is how is that going to impact-
2020-03-29,46:03,Donald Trump,That’s why people…
2020-03-29,46:03,Donald Trump,"Excuse me, you didn’t hear me, that’s why you used to work for The Times and now you work for somebody else. Look, let me tell you something, be nice. Don’t be-"
2020-03-29,46:09,Yamiche Alcindor,"Mr. President, my question is …"
2020-03-29,46:11,Donald Trump,"… don’t be threatening, be nice. Go ahead."
2020-03-29,46:13,Yamiche Alcindor,"My question is, how is that going to impact how you fill these orders for ventilators, or for mass? Your views that-"
2020-03-29,46:18,Donald Trump,It’s not going to impact.
2020-03-29,46:18,Yamiche Alcindor,It’s not going to impact you at all?
2020-03-29,46:20,Donald Trump,"We’re producing tremendous numbers of ventilators, we’re doing a great job on it, Mike Pence, our vice president, just headed up the task force, which has been incredible the job they’ve done, we have everybody in the White House working on it, everybody in the country is working on this in one way or the other, the fact is we’ve done a great job of delivering."
2020-03-29,46:39,Donald Trump,"You’ve seen the biggest people in the business. I mean, there’s nobody even close to this group of people, we had a meeting at three o’clock, it lasted for a long time, it was a great meeting with the generals, and with everybody else, and they have done a fantastic job."
2020-03-29,46:53,Donald Trump,"I’m just saying this, if they’re holding … Let me give you one example, we sent thousands of generators to New York, they were put into a warehouse, a New York warehouse, that happened to be located, interestingly, in Edison, New Jersey, they were given to New York, and we then went to other places also giving thousands of ventilators."
2020-03-29,47:14,Donald Trump,"The people in New York never distributed the generators. We said, “Why didn’t you distribute them?” Now, you have to understand, they have New York people working in those warehouses, they knew they had them, so we said, “Why didn’t you distribute them?” I hope they’ve distributed them now, but maybe they didn’t need them so badly, but just so you know, we’re all, you, me, everybody, we’re all on the same team."
2020-03-29,47:36,Donald Trump,"When journalists get up, and you’re a journalist, a fine journalist, when journalists get up-"
2020-03-29,47:40,Yamiche Alcindor,I was quoting you directly from Sean Hannity.
2020-03-29,47:41,Donald Trump,"… and ask questions that are so threatening, we’re all on the same team."
2020-03-29,47:45,Yamiche Alcindor,I was quoting you directly from your interview with Sean Hannity.
2020-03-29,47:47,Donald Trump,"Take a look at my interview, what I want to do is if there is something wrong, we have to get to the bottom of it. When I hear facemasks go from 10,000 to 300,000 and they constantly need more, and the biggest man in the business is shocked, he knows all about the virus by the way, he’s not surprised by that, he knows all about it, he shouldn’t be surprised, he should say, “Well, they’re standard because this is really a very tough disease. This is really a very tough virus to handle.” Okay, please go ahead-"
2020-03-29,48:17,Yamiche Alcindor,"Mr. President, my second question is …"
2020-03-29,48:19,Donald Trump,"Go ahead. That’s enough, thank you very much."
2020-03-29,48:20,Yamiche Alcindor,But Mr. President my second question-
2020-03-29,48:21,Donald Trump,"Please, please, that’s enough."
2020-03-29,48:24,Yamiche Alcindor,My second question is-
2020-03-29,48:24,Donald Trump,That’s enough.
2020-03-29,48:24,Yamiche Alcindor,Mr. President I have-
2020-03-29,48:25,Donald Trump,"That’s enough. That’s not fair to your other reporters. It’s not fair, you had a long time, a long question. If we have time I’ll get back to you for your second question, is that okay? All right, thank you. I appreciate it."
2020-03-29,48:36,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President, just to follow up on previous questions, you said that the peak will hit in two weeks …"
2020-03-29,48:42,Donald Trump,"Well, we don’t know that, but we think the peak will hit."
2020-03-29,48:44,Unnamed,You think it will hit in-
2020-03-29,48:45,Donald Trump,Right.
2020-03-29,48:45,Unnamed,"… two weeks, can-"
2020-03-29,48:45,Donald Trump,That is our two-
2020-03-29,48:47,Unnamed,Sure.
2020-03-29,48:47,Donald Trump,… doctors here.
2020-03-29,48:47,Unnamed,Can you just share with us your understanding of how bad it will be so the American people will be prepared for it?
2020-03-29,48:55,Donald Trump,"Well I can, I think I’ll ask doctor and doctor, maybe you could both come up and give your opinion on that, because that’s really …"
2020-03-29,49:01,Unnamed,And I have another question on Italy please.
2020-03-29,49:03,Donald Trump,"Okay, please."
2020-03-29,49:06,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. We have gray concerns when you look at the model, as I told you, look at the Chris Murray model where he shows a rapid escalation, and you can see it happening with the people we’re losing every day throughout America, and you can see it going up, just like cases, and we’re starting to lose people at the same rate, and we have deep concerns about that."
2020-03-29,49:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think we’re meeting, and we’ve had calls with the clinicians, and that has been extraordinarily helpful. I think you’re watching the alerts, and we have a different population than Italy or Spain, and so because of that, our doctors and our nurses are getting information back really quickly, so that they can talk to each other about how to really combat this."
2020-03-29,49:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’re seeing things here that weren’t reported in other countries, and so I really want to appreciate, I know doctors and nurses are going full out, but they’re also taking the time and their two hours of sleep to write us about what could be happening when you see the cardiovascular disease and others."
2020-03-29,50:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So in the model, and there’s a large confidence interval, and so it’s anywhere in the model between 80,000 and 160,000 maybe even potentially 200,000 people, so coming to this, that’s with mitigation. In that model, they make full assumption that we continue doing like exactly what we’re doing, but even better in every metro area with a level of intensity, because we’re hoping that the models are not completely right, that we can do better than what the predictions are."
2020-03-29,50:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But we’re tracking it very closely, and I think there’s people around the United States really helping us. Scientists across the country have really given freely of their time to really help us not only model this, but really assure that the American public knows how important it is that they stay doing this. You could see from the recent data, and I have Dr. Fauci talk about young people that are being impacted here."
2020-03-29,51:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We didn’t see that the same way in Europe, but our population is about eight or nine years younger, and so we have to be attentive to all aspects of this, to children, to young people, to adults. We know still the people with preexisting conditions, and the elderly are at particularly high risk, but we don’t want to lose any American, and so that’s why I think the president came to the conclusion that at a minimum we have to continue what we’ve been doing, but even better, to every metro area out there we have to do better, we have to ensure that we’re protecting each other. Tony, you’re on."
2020-03-29,51:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you. So, at the risk of offending my modeling colleagues, models are good, but models often generate the kind of anxious question that you asked, is how bad could this possibly get? And as I’ve said many, many times, a model is as good as the assumptions that you put into the model, and very often many of these assumptions are based on a complexity of issues that aren’t necessarily the same as Dr. Birx said from one country to the other."
2020-03-29,52:19,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So when you give a model, you have the worst extreme, you have the best extreme. Often the worst extreme means that you don’t do anything, you just, as we say, let it rip and let it go. If you go to the low end, that means you actually mitigate it really to the utmost."
2020-03-29,52:36,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So what I like to do as a scientist, a physician, a public health official, is to not ignore models, but say, “Look at the data as it’s evolving, and do everything you possibly can to mitigate that instead of getting overly anxious about the extremes of the model.”"
2020-03-29,52:55,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Again, not to push them aside completely, but the reason the president made the announcement today about going to the end of April, is because we want to make sure that we don’t prematurely think we’re doing so great. We may be, but we want to push it to the extreme. So take that with you, and maybe you’ll be less anxious. Okay."
2020-03-29,53:17,Unnamed,"Mr. President, on behalf of the foreign pool, sir, you mentioned Italy …"
2020-03-29,53:21,Donald Trump,Just to finish what …
2020-03-29,53:22,Unnamed,Sure.
2020-03-29,53:23,Donald Trump,"So what both were saying, and what Dr. Fauci just brought up, we don’t want to do well and then end a little bit early and have it start going up again, because that would be a disaster. Go ahead, please."
2020-03-29,53:37,Unnamed,"You mentioned Italy, Italy is a close ally of the United States."
2020-03-29,53:41,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-29,53:42,Unnamed,They’re facing catastrophic time …
2020-03-29,53:43,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-29,53:44,Unnamed,"… they have been receiving help from countries like Russia, China, even Cuba, Cuban doctors have been sent to Italy, is the United States stepping into how a close ally that Italy-"
2020-03-29,53:52,Donald Trump,"Yes, we are. In fact, I met last night with our people, we’re sending them a lot of different things that we’re not needing because we’re obviously in need of a lot also, and we’re also helping them monetarily."
2020-03-29,54:07,Donald Trump,"We are helping Italy a lot, we’re working very closely with Italy, and we’re working closely with Spain too, which is really hit hard, and we’re working with everybody. I spoke with Angela Merkel the other day, Germany’s hit hard, their mortality rate is different I think because they do more testing, but their mortality rate is much different."
2020-03-29,54:24,Donald Trump,"Italy’s mortality rate is very high, so is Spain, but we’re working very closely with them, yes. We had a big meeting on it last night. Admiral Giroir, would you please come up and just talk a little bit about the tremendous success that’s been made on testing from where we started? Thank you."
2020-03-29,54:42,Brett Giroir,"Thank you Mr. President. So as of close of business yesterday, we have been able to perform in the United States over 894,000 tests, so highly significantly increased every single day. Those tests are performed at a number of places, in hospitals, in your neighborhood, in the public health laboratories, the state public health laboratories in our territories, as well as the large reference laboratories that are members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association."
2020-03-29,55:12,Brett Giroir,"They have done over 650,000 tests, including over 840,000 just yesterday. I met with all their CEOs yesterday, they’re fully committed to increasing testing to meet the request and the demands of the president and vice president. A couple of words on the point of care test, point of care means you stop, you get the result right there that the president and the vice president have talked about by Abbott, approved in record time by Dr. Steve Hahn and the FDA."
2020-03-29,55:40,Brett Giroir,"This is a point of care test, meaning that from the time to swab to the time you get a positive result, five minutes like the president said, and at most 15 minutes for a negative result. So just think of it as a 15-minute test. This is not an esoteric test, there are 18,000 of these little toaster-size machines all over the country, in doctor’s offices, in hospitals right now, and Abbott will be providing 50,000 or more tests per day starting on April 2nd, with the first shipments out already."
2020-03-29,56:12,Brett Giroir,"This compliments other point of care testing, like the Cepheid test that we announced about a week ago. We also have moderate platforms, so it’s not just about the number, it’s the type. We have point-of-care, we have moderate platforms that are in hospitals, and in larger clinics, and academic medical centers, and then we have the very large test, you’ve heard Ambassador Burkes talk about the Roche test, and the Roche platforms that are in some of these big reference laboratories."
2020-03-29,56:37,Brett Giroir,"So it’s not just about the number, but it’s about painting this very complex ecosystem so that everybody who needs a test can get a test. On priorities, remember, we are still prioritizing those in most need, those who are in hospitals or in ICUs, because that test makes a difference to how they’re being treated."
2020-03-29,56:57,Brett Giroir,"Symptomatic first responders, healthcare workers, and as Administrator Verma will always say, “Those in longterm care facilities are at high risk.” One last point, I’ve learned more about nasal swabs than I ever thought I would want to learn in my entire life, but it was a very big thing that the FDA approved last week, and it will now be implemented this week. Instead of having a provider stick this all the way in the back of your nose, that’s uncomfortable, but it also requires PPE changes every time it’s done, the FDA approved with lots of data supporting it, self swab of your nose."
2020-03-29,57:34,Brett Giroir,"So literally, put a swab, certain kind of swab, foam swab in your nose, put it in a plastic bag, give it in and drop it. This not only increases the speed, but it eliminates all those changes of PPE. So we will be implementing that this week, which will increase speed, but also save our precious resources as we build them up in the stockpile and out to hospitals. Thank you sir."
2020-03-29,57:57,Donald Trump,"Thank you Giroir. Thank you Admiral very much, yeah please, go ahead."
2020-03-29,58:01,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you mentioned that the peak could come in two weeks, can you ensure that everyone that needs a ventilator, every single patient that needs one will get one, will it get there in time? And my second question is, after invoking the Defense Production Act yesterday with GM, you said that there were a couple of problem children that may require using your authority again, what are those companies and what aren’t they meeting?"
2020-03-29,58:25,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t have to tell you because those companies have come into line, they’re doing a great job, they’re working very hard 24 hours round the clock, so I don’t want to give their names now because they’ve been great, they’ve come into line. And by the way, General Motors is doing a fantastic job, I don’t think we have to worry about General Motors now, they’ve really, done their job."
2020-03-29,58:44,Donald Trump,"And what the Admiral said also, I think we can add this Admiral, the reason we show more cases than anybody else in the world is we’re doing more testing than anybody else in the world, so we have more cases because we’re doing far more testing than anybody in the world. And remember, we started with a system that was broken, for many years it was broken, and I’m not blaming the last administration, I’m saying other administrations, and our pipeline had very little in it, just like we had no ammunition, we had very little medical, we had very little in our pipeline."
2020-03-29,59:14,Donald Trump,"Now we have ammunition more than hopefully we’ll ever need, and we also have a pipeline that’s packed, and now we have those 10,000 ventilators that we can use because you need some quickly, I mean this goes quickly from place to place. I’d love to give them all out right now, but we need them quickly. I don’t want to give them out and then we have to take them back and move them someplace else. So we’re very much prepared. Please."
2020-03-29,59:40,Unnamed,"Mr. President, states like Florida have reportedly had 100% of their requests for supplies from the national strategic stockpile filled, but other states like Massachusetts have not, so how was that assessment being made and why has Florida gotten its request fulfilled?"
2020-03-29,59:56,Donald Trump,"Well, I think you’re going to find that almost all states … Look, I was on the call yesterday with the governors, and they were happy with the job we’re doing, and I’ll tell you what, if you had a different administration, they would not have been happy. These are people that speak their mind, they were happy."
2020-03-29,01:00:11,Donald Trump,"It was falsely reported by a couple of people that, “Oh gee, they weren’t.” They were happy, they were thrilled. Florida has been taken care of, and Michigan has been taken care of, very important state. To me it’s very important because I’m so proud of what we’ve done bringing car companies back into Michigan, and we’re now dealing with the governor, and I think, Mike, I can say that a lot of good things are happening in Michigan, Massachusetts, we’re dealing with the governor very strongly, and we’re trying to get things to Massachusetts as rapidly as possible."
2020-03-29,01:00:40,Unnamed,"But why has Florida received 100% of its requests compared to some other states, is there a reason?"
2020-03-29,01:00:45,Donald Trump,"Well, Florida, look, they’re very aggressive in trying to get things, and they’re doing a very good job, but I think I can say all of the governors are very committed, we’re very committed, we’re working together, and we’re getting things out at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. You can speak to FedEx, you can speak to UPS, you can speak, they’ve never done anything like this, what they’re doing right now, and nobody in the world has been able to match what these great companies have been able to do. If we left that to government it would have been a tough thing. We have mobilized private enterprise, we have mobilized the greatest companies in the world, and what’s happening is incredible."
2020-03-29,01:01:23,Donald Trump,"And that includes Abbott, where Abbott comes out and all of a sudden out of nowhere comes up with this incredible test that simplifies everything, it makes it so easy. So I think you’re going to find most states are very happy. I’m dealing with the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, he’s a Democrat, if that’s what you’re getting at, but I’m dealing with him very successfully, I think he’s very happy. I think he’s actually amazed at what he’s been able to get."
2020-03-29,01:01:45,Donald Trump,"In fact, we were even forward-thinking, I suggested we send additional ventilators and other things, we’re building a hospital in Louisiana, very importantly, we’re building hospitals in New Jersey, Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a terrific guy, and frankly he’s got a pretty hotspot right there, right next to New York, and we’re doing hospitals, we’re doing ventilators, we’re getting a lot to Governor Murphy, that’s New Jersey."
2020-03-29,01:02:12,Unnamed,And may I ask-
2020-03-29,01:02:12,Donald Trump,Last night I spoke-
2020-03-29,01:02:15,Unnamed,Okay.
2020-03-29,01:02:15,Donald Trump,"… to the governor of Connecticut, we had a great talk with him, we are really doing the job."
2020-03-29,01:02:20,Donald Trump,"Look, Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, he’s been terrific. We send them a boat way ahead of schedule, the ship way ahead of schedule, hospital ship, The Mercy, with 1,000 beds, operating rooms, and it’s been in LA for three days already."
2020-03-29,01:02:36,Donald Trump,"So, I think they’re really happy, and when you think about it, in New York we built 2,900 hospital rooms, beds, nobody’s ever seen it before. The governor has never seen anything like that before, this was done by federal government, not by state government, this was done by the federal government, they’re opening it tomorrow."
2020-03-29,01:02:57,Donald Trump,"I wanted to be there so badly, but Secret Service and all of the people involved won’t let me, they won’t let me. I would love to be there, but they won’t let me for obvious reasons, but I would’ve loved to have been at the opening tomorrow of the hospital in New York at Javits Center."
2020-03-29,01:03:13,Donald Trump,"But we’re very proud of the job we’ve done, we’ve mobilized, and getting better and better every day, and the taskforce headed by your vice president, the job they’ve done, and they don’t even sleep. Okay, any other questions?"
2020-03-29,01:03:28,Unnamed,"Sir, sir, may I just follow up on your letter to the governors that you sent, since we were on the topic of governors, you sent a letter to governors at the end of the week saying that you guys were going to be developing criteria to be-"
2020-03-29,01:03:39,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-29,01:03:39,Unnamed,… able to classify counties-
2020-03-29,01:03:42,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-03-29,01:03:42,Unnamed,"… based on whether they were hotspots, or whatnot, and I wanted to know if you have enough tests currently to be able to accurately rank those counties?"
2020-03-29,01:03:53,Donald Trump,"Yeah. We’re ranking counties, and we’re ranking states, and a lot of people put out false information because they don’t know what they’re talking about, and we took over a dead barren system, we took over a system that was obsolete, it was good for a tiny little sample of people, and even that didn’t work, because when CDC first looked at their test, the biggest problem they had is the test didn’t work."
2020-03-29,01:04:16,Donald Trump,"That wasn’t from us, that’s been there a long time. Now we have the best tests in the world, and nobody has, now they’re all calling, “Can we get the quick test?” We call it the quick test, where, by the way, probably more accurate and it takes a few minutes. I mean, it’s pretty amazing what we’ve done. Now, we’re getting along great with the governors, yeah go ahead, please. No, go ahead please."
2020-03-29,01:04:39,Unnamed,Okay. Thank you so much Mr. President.
2020-03-29,01:04:40,Donald Trump,"Yeah, thank you."
2020-03-29,01:04:40,Unnamed,"I wanted to ask you more specifically about the strategy that you plan to unveil on Tuesday, what factors are you taking into consideration? What can the American people expect? And is it possible that these April 30th guidelines could be extended?"
2020-03-29,01:04:57,Donald Trump,"Well, we hope not, but we think it’s going to … we have aspirational thoughts, we would have loved to have been a little bit sooner, but we have to do it right."
2020-03-29,01:05:08,Donald Trump,"We could have done it, we could have done it on Easter, but there was a good chance that if it’s coming down, or if it’s still going up, maybe it’s going to be coming down by then, but we just felt it was too soon."
2020-03-29,01:05:19,Donald Trump,"We can’t take a chance. Again, because of what we’ve done, and because of the fact that we’ve stopped the flow from China so early, because the question is, from a lot of my friends, “Why don’t we just wing it? Why didn’t we just wing it?” And I kept asking, and we did models now, finally we got these models in, and you hear about the 2.2 million people would have died."
2020-03-29,01:05:40,Donald Trump,"I don’t mean we would have had 2.2 million cases, these are 2.2 million people would have died, 2.2 million people. Look, we’re going to have a meeting, or speech, or press conference, or something on Tuesday, I thought what I’d do, I was going to announce the end of April on Tuesday, but I said let’s do it now, because somewhere along the line it’s going to leak, we might as well just do it now and get rid of all the leaks, this way it didn’t, nice and clean."
2020-03-29,01:06:06,Donald Trump,"But we have to really do a great job for another couple of weeks, and I think we’re going to be in great shape, and we’re going to be in a position, even with what we’re trying to do with restaurants, with deductability, we have to get these restaurants back in, we have to get our businesses open, we have to get the planes flying, we have to get everything going, we have to get even the cruise ships, I mean we have to get those cruise ships moving along."
2020-03-29,01:06:29,Donald Trump,"We had the greatest economy in the history of the world three weeks ago, and now we’ve said, “Please don’t work anymore.” We’re actually paying people not to work. Nobody’s ever heard that, that’s not for us. People want to work, but at the same time, and I’m so glad that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx gave us a number, and the number on the outside, and maybe it’s not even on the outside, we don’t know, is 2.2 million people would have died if we didn’t do what we’re doing."
2020-03-29,01:07:01,Donald Trump,"And now we’re looking at numbers that are going to be much, much, much lower than that, and it makes everything we’re doing feel much better to me. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-29,01:07:12,Jeremy,"Thank you sir. I do have a question for you, but I’d like to let my colleague Gamish finish her second question if that’s all right?"
2020-03-29,01:07:15,Donald Trump,"That would be fine, finish it. Go ahead."
2020-03-29,01:07:17,Unnamed,Thanks Jeremy.
2020-03-29,01:07:18,Donald Trump,"I was going to call on you next, you know that."
2020-03-29,01:07:19,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve also said that at one point that you thought more people might die from the economic tragedies, and the economic problems in America due to the coronavirus outbreak, what health officials are telling you that, and Dr. Fauci could you speak to that idea that there might be mental health and suicide related to this, would that outpace at some point the virus’s impact on the society? Thank you."
2020-03-29,01:07:43,Donald Trump,"Well, I could ask Dr. Fauci to come up, but it’s common sense. You’re going to have massive depression, meaning mental depression, you’re going to have depression in the economy also, but you’re going to have mental depression for people, you’re going to have large numbers of suicides, take a look at what happens in a really horrible recession or worse, so you’re going to have tremendous suicides, but you know what you’re going to have more than anything else? Drug addiction."
2020-03-29,01:08:08,Donald Trump,"You will see drugs being used like nobody’s ever used them before, and people are going to be dying all over the place from drug addiction, because you would have people that had a wonderful job at a restaurant, or even owned a restaurant, I spoke to great people today that have done a great job, and one day they’re at the top of their business, they’re celebrity chefs, they’ve got the most successful restaurants, and in one day they have nothing, they’ve gotten wiped out, one day, from our enemy, this invisible, horrible scourge."
2020-03-29,01:08:38,Donald Trump,"So, when you ask me that, it’s so easy to figure that, I mean, massive drug use, massive depression, mental depression, massive numbers of suicide, anxiety causes disease, they say, a lot of people … you’re going to have tremendous, and hopefully we’re not going to have that, because hopefully, by what we’re doing, we get the best of both worlds. We don’t have to …"
2020-03-29,01:09:03,Donald Trump,"… by what we’re doing, we get the best of both worlds. We don’t have 2.2 million deaths. We have a number that’s much less, much, much less, and at the same time, we get our country running again. Please, thank you [crosstalk 01:09:14]-"

2020-03-29,01:09:19,Donald Trump,Which is very unusual for CNN.
2020-03-29,01:09:21,Unnamed,"Two quick questions. First of all, during this 30-day additional period, do you anticipate at all relaxing those restrictions by region during these additional 30 days-"
2020-03-29,01:09:30,Donald Trump,I don’t think so-
2020-03-29,01:09:31,Unnamed,Or no?
2020-03-29,01:09:31,Donald Trump,"It’s a great question, actually, and I asked that the same. I said, “How about Nebraska? How about Idaho? How about Iowa?” You know what? Those people are so great, the whole Midwest, I don’t think they want to be in that position, actually. Probably, I was given a pretty strong look by these two people. They said, “We don’t like that idea”, so we’re relying on them. They’re the best in their profession and they didn’t like the idea."

2020-03-29,01:10:35,Donald Trump,"Your statement and your response and your answer is a lie because here’s the story. Are you ready? I said, “I want you to be appreciative of me”, and then you go on and then I go on and you cut it off, but it says [crosstalk 01:10:46]-"
2020-03-29,01:10:46,Unnamed,"You said, “I want [crosstalk 01:10:47] them to be appreciative. I don’t want them to say things that aren’t true. I want them to be appreciative.

2020-03-29,01:11:06,Unnamed,Why in this time [crosstalk 01:11:07]-
2020-03-29,01:11:06,Donald Trump,"But Mike Pence calls and the Head of FEMA calls. I don’t stop them. Did I ever ask you to do anything negative Mike to Washington? The State of Washington? Michigan, I love that state. That’s [crosstalk 01:11:17] one of my favorite places in the whole world, Michigan, and I’m so proud of what’s happened with the auto industry. It’s coming back to Michigan. No, I don’t have to call because I’m probably better off not. He’s a failed Presidential candidate. He’s a nasty person. I don’t like the Governor of Washington, so you know who calls? I get Mike Pence to call. I get the Head of FEMA to call. I get the Admiral to call, but what you didn’t say… See, you started it off and you talked about, “I have to be appreciated”, but then when you read the rest [crosstalk 01:11:47]-"
2020-03-29,01:11:47,Unnamed,"Yeah, you [crosstalk 01:11:47]-"
2020-03-29,01:11:47,Donald Trump,"It said, “Because if you don’t appreciate you’re not respecting these incredible people, the two admirals.

See, that’s why people aren’t watching CNN very much anymore. That’s why they don’t like it."
2020-03-29,01:12:14,Donald Trump,"That’s why you’re ratings are no good because you even after knowing the truth for days now, you bring up the old lie. Read the rest of your question, the rest of your statement you didn’t put in. You have to put that in and it said in there FEMA and it said in there Army Corps of Engineers because when they disrespect me, they’re disrespecting our government. You know what? I don’t mind if I’m disrespected, but they can’t disrespect the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. Okay-"

2020-03-29,01:13:21,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-29,01:13:21,Unnamed,"Through the end of next month, and of course, you know there have been shelter-in-place orders that have been imposed by governors and mayors all throughout the country. When you take that all into account, it sounds like, and it seems like you’ve acknowledged, that America essentially will be shut down for the next few weeks, maybe even the next two months. You mentioned June 1st as a date in which you’d like America [crosstalk 01:13:43]-"
2020-03-29,01:13:42,Donald Trump,"No, we think it’s going to really start to open up. We think that that’s going to be the bottom of the hill. That’s where we’re looking at, June 1st, maybe even a little bit sooner than that. We have this hill. If we did nothing, the hill would have been up here. We did a lot. We did just about maximum and we got lucky because we stopped China from coming in and then later on we stopped Europe. We got lucky. We got very lucky. The people that were coming in here, they went to Italy, they went to Spain, they went to other countries. We got lucky and they got unlucky, to be honest with you."
2020-03-29,01:14:16,Donald Trump,"You look at what’s going on in Italy and Spain in particular. No, I don’t want that. June 1st, we think we can reach the bottom of that hill on June 1st and that would be a great thing. I have confidence of the two doctors. I think that could be a day. It could even be sooner. It could be a little bit later. It could be sooner, but I think people would be very happy if we did a job and saved potentially millions of lives, I think people would be very happy with that date."

2020-03-29,01:14:45,Donald Trump,"Okay [crosstalk 01:14:46] yes, please [crosstalk 01:14:46]-"
2020-03-29,01:14:46,Unnamed,"Sir, Mr. President, my question actually has to do with the $2.3 trillion relief bill that you signed into law. In your view, do you think that another relief bill, another phase bill, may be necessary? Are you prepared to support that, Mr. President?"
2020-03-29,01:15:01,Donald Trump,"Well, I’m prepared to do whatever’s necessary to, number one, save lives, and number two, bring our economy back strong just like it was before. I think our economy has a chance to be just as good and even better than it was before. Remember, a lot of the money that you read about, that’s all coming back. These are loans to great companies that got stopped from doing business. They’ll be back very soon, so much of the money that we’re talking about, that money’s coming back and we’ll take warrants, meaning we’ll take pieces of the company for the taxpayers of our nation."
2020-03-29,01:15:33,Donald Trump,"I expect that we’ll make a lot of money with that money. We’re going to make a lot of money, and that’s okay. I don’t even want to talk about making money because what I want to talk about is two things. Number one is saving lives, and number two is bringing our economy back, but I think we’re going to do very well. That whole money is a lot of it’s coming back. Please."
2020-03-29,01:15:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you. Earlier this afternoon, you had tweeted that there are on average 18.5 million Americans tuned into these daily press briefings, yet there are some networks out there that are, I apologize, concerned about taking these briefings."
2020-03-29,01:16:06,Donald Trump,"No, I know exactly what you’re saying. No, I’ve read that [crosstalk 01:16:07]-"
2020-03-29,01:16:07,Unnamed,What do you say to these detractors?
2020-03-29,01:16:08,Donald Trump,"Well, I read that CNN doesn’t want to cover them, except that they can’t help them because their ratings are so high. If the ratings were low, they wouldn’t be here. This man wouldn’t be here. In a hundred years, you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all of their cameras if they’re bad because we help their ratings. We lift up their ratings because their ratings are very low, but for the most part I haven’t heard that. I will say The Washington Post has a drive on not to go to the President of the United States news conference because, frankly, so many people are watching. We’re getting the word out, we’re getting the accurate word out, and a lot of people are happy about it and a lot of people aren’t, but they should be happy."
2020-03-29,01:16:51,Donald Trump,"When I have the General, when I have Seema and when I have Tony and when I have our… these are all people that have become big stars, but they’ve done a great job. Deborah has done a fantastic… All of these people, they don’t want to be stars. You know what they want? They want to win. They want to win the battle against the virus. They’ve been fighting this stuff their whole life, between Ebola and swine flu and, I don’t know, I’m not sure I’d love your life, but that’s what you like, right? That’s what they do. They fight disease, and you know what? There’s nobody that does it better. I think the American public, ultimately, they should be the decider. If they don’t want to watch, they shouldn’t watch and we shouldn’t have bigger ratings than The Bachelor, or as The New York Times said, we have Monday Night Football-type ratings."
2020-03-29,01:17:38,Donald Trump,"Now, I didn’t say that. I have no idea what they are in a sense, but I know that The Times, they say that it’s all the news that’s fit to print, I say it’s all the news that’s not fit to print because I think they are not honest people, but that’s okay. They can’t help it, but even they said that the ratings are like Monday Night Football ratings and that these are like Bachelor Finale. That’s their end when the big deal happened. I have no idea what happened because I’m too busy working on this. Somebody will tell me what happened. No, I think it’s terrible. When they don’t want the President of the United States to have a voice, you’re not talking about democracy any longer. Please. Thank you very much."
2020-03-29,01:18:22,Unnamed,"[inaudible 01:18:22] you talked a lot about the [inaudible 01:18:29]. Thanks, Mr. President. You’ve talked a lot about concerns about leaving the [inaudible 01:18:32] for so long. Was there any dissent from your top economic advisors in your decision to leave the guidelines in place [crosstalk 01:18:40]-"
2020-03-29,01:18:39,Donald Trump,No.
2020-03-29,01:18:39,Unnamed,Until the end of April?
2020-03-29,01:18:40,Donald Trump,"No, and this is before we heard the 2.2 million people. I mean, we had a lot of people were saying maybe we shouldn’t do anything, just ride it. They say ride it like a cowboy. Just ride it. Ride that sucker right through. That’s where the 2.2 million people come in. Would have died maybe, but it would have been 1.6 to 2.2, and that’s not acceptable, but there were a lot of people that said… I thought about it. I said, “Maybe we should ride it through.” You know you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We’re in the midst of a bad flu season."
2020-03-29,01:19:16,Donald Trump,"You know we had a bad season last year as an example, a bad flu season. You’ll have 35, 36, 37,000 people die, sometimes more, sometimes less. This is different and part of this is the unknown. Part of it also is the viciousness of it. I had a friend who went to a hospital the other day. He’s a little older and he’s heavy, but he’s a tough person. He went to the hospital and a day later he’s in a coma. I go, “How’s he doing?” “Sir, he’s in a coma. He’s unconscious.” He’s not doing well. The speed and the viciousness, especially if it gets the right person, it’s horrible. It’s really horrible. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-29,01:20:05,Unnamed,"[inaudible 01:20:05] Mr. President, this may be good for some of the advisors as well. We’ve heard some rumors that Louisiana is really going to get hit hard next because of the possibility with Mardi Gras. Have you guys seen any data to back that up of what happened a few weeks ago? Whether or not that’s contributing to the spike [crosstalk 01:20:21]-"
2020-03-29,01:20:20,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-03-29,01:20:20,Unnamed,In Louisiana and [crosstalk 01:20:21]-
2020-03-29,01:20:21,Donald Trump,"I don’t think it’s a rumor, I think it’s a fact and Louisiana has been hit hard. Louisiana is an example. It started off with like nobody for so long when I spoke to the Governor, but Deborah or Tony, either of you, if you’d like to talk about it?"
2020-03-29,01:20:38,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You know, I think you heard us talk about a week ago that we were very worried about the numbers and how they were increasing in Louisiana, how they were increasing in Cook County, how they were increasing in Dearborn and Detroit. I think those are areas that we’re still watching very careful, and like the President said, when people get this virus, some people do very poorly. When certain metro areas get exposed to the virus, we see this really very rapid expansion of the virus. We think it may have been circulating there for a couple of weeks."
2020-03-29,01:21:12,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I don’t like to look backwards. I only like to look forwards and really we are putting all of our effort into ensuring that the people of New Orleans, the people of the Detroit region, frankly, the people of New York. Some of the fastest growing counties are not New York itself, New York City, when you look at it per hundred thousand, it’s Rockland, it’s Bergen. I mean, all of these places are people that have transited through cities, and that’s why we really did want the travel advisory just to really warn people to watch out for their own health, to really take their temperatures. It can go from 50, hundred, 500 cases, and then the next thing you know, it’s 2,000, it’s 4,000, it’s 10,000, and because it then gets across all communities, people get very sick."
2020-03-29,01:22:10,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You know, you made the comment about New Orleans, this could happen anywhere and that’s really one of the issues that we’re concerned about and why we were so reluctant to pull back at a time when we need to put our foot on the gas as opposed to on the brake. As what Dr. Birx said, this is exactly what you see. There are a number of communities, cities, or states, what have you, out there in which they’re trickling along like that."
2020-03-29,01:22:36,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Don’t get complacent about that because that’s exactly the way the virus works. It goes like this, then like this, then it goes up like that. That’s exactly what happened in New Orleans. That’s what happened in a terrible way with New York. That’s what we’re trying to avoid in multiple locations throughout the country. We shouldn’t take any solace when we see low levels in different states, different cities, different areas because they’re very vulnerable to an explosion."
2020-03-29,01:23:02,Unnamed,"Mr. President, last question from me, sir, just real quick. I asked the Vice President a week ago, and I think we talked about it last week as well. You took the test that first time. I remember that, and I think you took it last week Mr. Vice President. Have you had a chance to take it again? Does it get easier the second time around? How are you feeling?"
2020-03-29,01:23:18,Donald Trump,"I think I’m waiting for that little 45-minute test. I sort of like that, or now it’s down to five minutes I understand. No, I haven’t, but I think I will take it again if it’s appropriate. I don’t feel there’s any symptoms. Have you noticed any sniffles? Nothing, right? So far I haven’t felt that way, but you know there was a big strong point made originally. I think it still holds. Take the test if you need it if you have the symptoms. If you don’t, don’t take it. That’s put out by the professionals, so I don’t have it, but I would take it."
2020-03-29,01:23:50,Donald Trump,"I just wanted to say one thing also about what Tony had mentioned. I grew up in Queens, New York, and right next to a place called Elmhurst, Queens. They have a hospital that’s a very good hospital, Elmhurst Hospital. I’ve known it, I’ve known where it is. I can tell you the color on the outside, the size of the windows. I mean, I know it very well. It was near my community where I lived. I’ve been watching that for the last week on television. Body bags all over in hallways. I’ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks, freezer trucks. They’re freezer trucks because they can’t handle the bodies there’s so many of them. This is essentially in my community in Queens, New York. I’ve seen things that I’ve never seen before. I mean, I’ve seen them but I’ve seen them on television in far away lands. I’ve never seen them in our country."
2020-03-29,01:24:47,Donald Trump,"Elmhurst Hospital, unbelievable people. I mean, when I see the trucks pull up to take out bodies, and these are trucks that are as long as The Rose Garden and they’re pulling up to take out bodies and you look inside and you see the black body bags. You say, “What’s in there?” It’s Elmhurst Hospital, must be supplies. It’s not supplies, it’s people. I’ve never seen anything like it. These people are doing a fantastic job, and somebody else who’s doing a fantastic job is sitting here who is the Head of the Task Force and I just maybe want to finish off because I’d like to ask Mike, what do you think about what we’ve done? Where do you think we’re going? How do you feel also? You studied this so closely. How do you feel about the curve and the June 1st date? That’s aspirational, but I think that’s really modified aspirational because I think we’re going to hit it and maybe we’ll even beat it. Okay, Mike, please."
2020-03-29,01:25:50,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. Let me just join you in thanking the American people for the efforts that the people of this nation have made over the past 15 days and that we know they will continue to make over the next 30. You heard the President speak today about the modeling and on Tuesday he will share with the nation the full range of counsel of the team that he assembled now months ago at The White House Coronavirus Task Force. Will lay out to the country what could have been, but what we’re continuing to work to make a reality. In the meantime, I think every American should have a grateful heart. First and foremost, all of the incredible healthcare workers that are on the front lines at places like Elmhurst and elsewhere every single day. As Dr. Birx said, getting just a few hours of sleep and going right back into work. I mean, the are the hands and feet of American compassion and I want to say on behalf of your President and on behalf of a grateful nation that we’re with you. We’re going to continue to work tirelessly with these outstanding leaders at FEMA to make sure that you have the protective equipment to do your job safely and go home to your family."
2020-03-29,01:27:14,Mike Pence,"We’re going to continue to work with these incredible distributors. Literally, the aircraft that landed at JFK this morning is the first of 51 aircraft that are going to be coming in from around the world, and it’s all headed to support our healthcare workers and people that are on the front lines. Also, Mr. President. I want to say thank you to American businesses whose generosity is shining forth every day. The two insurance companies that you mentioned have waived copays and are providing full coronavirus coverage to Americans for the full treatment that people that are enduring this virus are experiencing. American businesses like those so well-represented here are stepping up every day with what the President likes to call a spirit the likes of which we haven’t seen for a while in this county and it’s truly inspiring."
2020-03-29,01:28:10,Mike Pence,"I also want to join your words about this team that you have assembled, not only the healthcare team, the extraordinary team at FEMA and HHS, but all of our partners at the state and local level and the work that they’re doing it. Mr. President, when you tapped me to do this five weeks ago, you said, “I want a full partnership with our states. I want to make sure the federal government is there working with our governors and all of the local health officials. To all of you who are managing your states, to all of you that are implementing those healthcare policies on the local level, you have our admiration and our commitment to continue to be with you."
2020-03-29,01:28:49,Mike Pence,"I think what the President laid out today, while it is I’m sure for many Americans that were hoping we would be with this sooner, there may be a modest sense of frustration and disappointment, but what I hear speaking to these healthcare experts is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. As the American people continue to put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines for Americans, each one of us continues to do our part, social distancing, avoiding groups of more than 10, using a drive-through at local restaurants, avoiding unnecessary travel. As every American continues to listen to your state and local leaders, to heed that domestic travel advisory that the CDC issued on Saturday night."
2020-03-29,01:29:43,Mike Pence,"We’re going to hasten the day that we get to the other side of this, as the President said and that we truly do believe that while there are challenges in the weeks ahead, there is hope that as every American continues to put these guidelines into practice, as every single one of us continues to do our part, that we’ll get through this. I mean, the American people know how tall the hill is, Mr. President. We’ve never failed to get over it and then some and I think with your leadership, with this extraordinary team that you have assembled, with the great leadership that we have at the state and local levels, the partnership with American businesses and the can-do spirit of the American people, we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this together. Thank you."
2020-03-29,01:30:32,Donald Trump,"Thank you. Thank you very much, Mike. I just want to end by saying that we’re all in this together, all of us. I have never seen anything like it. The unity, the esprit de corps, the spirit, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s a beautiful thing to watch. Unfortunately, the enemy is death. It’s death. A lot of people are dying, so it’s very unpleasant. It’s a very unpleasant thing to go through, but the level of competence, the level of caring, the level of love, I just think it’s brilliant and it’s possibly happening in other countries, possibly. I don’t know, I can’t speak to other countries, but I can speak to the United States of America, and I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I am very proud to be your President. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
2020-03-30,00:00,Donald Trump,"Appreciate you being here. Yesterday I announced that we would be extending our social distance guidelines through the end of April. This is based on modeling that show us the peak in fatalities will not arrive for another two weeks. The same modeling also shows that by very vigorously following these guidelines, we could save more than 1 million American lives. Think of that, 1 million American lives. Our future is in our own hands and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and really the fate of our victory. We will have a great victory. We have no other choice. Every one of us has a role to play in winning this war. Every citizen, family, and business can make the difference in stopping the virus. This is our shared patriotic duty. Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days and this is a very vital 30 days. We’re sort of putting it all on the line, this 30 days so important because we have to get back."
2020-03-30,01:10,Donald Trump,"But the more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis. And that’s the time we’re waiting for. The more we commit ourselves now, the sooner we can win the fight and return to our lives and they will be great lives. Maybe better than ever. Today we reached a historic milestone in our war against the coronavirus. Over 1 million Americans have now been tested, more than any other country by far, not even close and tested accurately. And I think what I’d like to do is ask Secretary Azar, who’s done a fantastic job to come up and just say a few words about the fact that we reached substantially now, more than 1 million tests. Please. Thank you Alex."
2020-03-30,02:06,Alex Azar,"Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in marshaling all the resources that we have for this unprecedented testing effort. And thank you, Mr. Vice President for leading a whole of economy approach to testing. As the President mentioned today, the United States hit more than 1 million samples tested, a number that no other country has reached. We’re now testing nearly 100,000 samples a day. Also, a level that no other country has reached. I want to thank every partner that has been involved in this effort. That includes all of the men and women of the FDA and the CDC, including Director Redfield and Commissioner Hahn. Together the FDA and CDC have worked to balance the need for testing on an aggressive scale with the scientific rigor that Americans expect. Working with our testing coordinator, Admiral Giroir, they have now truly unleashed the ingenuity of the private sector and our state and local leaders, the centerpieces of America’s historic approach to testing."
2020-03-30,03:09,Alex Azar,"I want to thank those state and local leaders who’ve used their on the ground resources and knowledge to lead testing and make it much more easily accessible to the Americans who need it. I’m also grateful to FEMA, with whom we are now working closely to get state and local partners what they need. I also want to thank CMS, where Administrator Verma has given healthcare providers unprecedented flexibility to scale up capacity for testing and treatment and has ensured that tests will be paid for. Finally, we would not be where we are today without the many American companies, entrepreneurs and scientists who have worked day and night to develop as of today, 20 different emergency testing options. With the FDA responding to request for authorization, typically within 24 hours the number of options is growing nearly every day. FDA has also opened up new options for using the available tests like self swabbing and new options for re-agents."
2020-03-30,04:03,Alex Azar,"I also want to thank FDA and other components of HHS for incredibly rapid action on other tools that we need. This weekend we actually worked to secure 30 million tablets from Sandoz and 1 million tablets from Bayer of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which are potential COVID 19 treatments and we authorized Patel’s new decontamination machines, which can each sterilize thousands of essential N95 masks for reuse every day. So thank you, Mr. President for your leadership and thank you to everybody who’s played a part in getting us where we are today. Thank you."
2020-03-30,04:38,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn come up FTA because we have some really good stuff. First of all, the numbers have been incredible on testing, but in the days ahead we’re going to go even faster and we have something from Abbott Labs which is right here and that’s a five minute test, highly accurate. I maybe can show that as we listen to our FDA commissioner, the job he’s done in the approval process. We talked about the chloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine just now. I thought that I’d mentioned it but Alex has already done that, but we have that now under test with 1,100 people in New York and it was only the fast approval by FDA that allowed us to do that. It was a really rapid approval. And Dr., please say a few words. This is the first one on the line of the five minute test from Abbott."
2020-03-30,05:42,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Thank you, Mr. President for your leadership. Thank you, Mr. Vice President for your leadership of the task force. I’m very proud of FDA staff’s work in the last few months to expedite the availability of testing in this country. I’m also incredibly appreciative of private industries and willingness to work with us quickly to develop and distribute those tests. We’ve had a substantial addition to testing with the authorization of point of care tests, especially the Abbott point of care tests, which the president has pulled out of the box. A point of care test is a test that gives you a result where you’re getting care."
2020-03-30,06:18,Dr. Steven Hahn,"This is truly a patient centered approach; whether it’s the doctor’s office, a hospital and emergency room, urgent care center, or a drive by testing site. Just like tests for flu or strep where go to the doctors, you could get the test done, you can get an answer within minutes of having this test done. Now, with those tests being approved for Abbott and for others, these are available around the country. They’re planning to scale up the number of tests that can be put out throughout the country over the next month and patients can get the answer within as little as 15 to five minutes. And then of course, an appropriate plan of treatment can be given."
2020-03-30,06:57,Dr. Steven Hahn,"We had FDA are working quickly with avid as well on other testing approaches and normally these tests take months to develop. I was on the phone today with the Abbott CEO. He told me that normally this is a 9 to 12 month approach to developing a point of care test. They did this in collaboration with FDA and US government within weeks. Abbott has shared that they will be delivering these tests tomorrow and then we’ll be ramping up. Just have to emphasize one thing, the most innovative and safe products come from the private sector, in partnership with government, taking an all hands on deck approach just like in this case. And the other point here is that Abbott and FDA work together to make sure that we had a fast, reliable and accurate test to market. Thank you."
2020-03-30,07:41,Donald Trump,"Great job. Really great job. Thank you, Steve. So the pharmaceutical company [inaudible 00:00:07:52], has been working with us very closely. And as Alex mentioned, a little bit, 30 million doses of the hydroxychloroquine to the United States government. It’s been given. And Bayer has donated 1 million doses of the chloroquine, which will soon be distributed to states and state health officials around the country. Teva Pharmaceuticals is also donating 6 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to US hospitals. 6 million doses. So the private sector as you’d say, Steve, it’s been amazing what’s happened. Really amazing. And we’re going to introduce you to some of the greatest business executives in the world today, no matter where you go. And they’re going to say a little bit about what they’re doing. And then we have so many more."
2020-03-30,08:47,Donald Trump,"The FDA has also authorized the materials, N95 respirator mask sterilization kits. It’s an incredible thing. I’ve been asking why are we throwing these masks away? You look at some of these masks and they’re significant pieces of equipment that I say, how come you throw them away? Why aren’t they using sterilization techniques? And I got a call from Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio. And he’s a tremendous guy, tremendous governor. And he said, we have a company named [inaudible 00:09:24] and they’re having a hard time getting approval from the FDA. And I called up Dr. Hahn and within a very short period of time, they got the approval. Steve, we really appreciate it. I want to thank Mike and I want to thank Steve. And they’re going to be able, each machine now, can disinfect 120,000 masks per day. Now think of that. Each machine can disinfect 120,000 masks per day. It’ll be just like a new one. It could go up to about 20 times for each mask."
2020-03-30,09:58,Donald Trump,"Each mask can go through this process 20 times. They have two in Ohio, one in New York, and one will soon be shipped to Seattle, Washington, and also to Washington D.C. So that’s going to make a tremendous difference on the masks. This morning I spoke to our nation’s governors to help each state get the medical supplies they need. Yesterday, Vice President Mike Pence asked our nation’s hospitals to begin reporting total bed capacity, ICU bed capacity, ventilator capacity, and vital medical supply levels on a daily basis. And Mike, thank you for the great job. Thank you very much."
2020-03-30,10:40,Donald Trump,"In New York, the 2,900 bed hospital under construction, which is now completed. They completed it in three days. You might say three and a half days, at the Javits Center, will be completed today. When you look … So they’re going up, I think we’re going to be adding some more beds which will be completed today. We’ve opened up … Whoops, there goes our box and my hair’s blowing around and it’s mine. The one thing you can’t get away with if it’s not yours you got a problem if you’re President. A nearly 3000 medical beds will become operational. The US Navy ship Comfort also arrived today equipped with 12 operating rooms and 1000 hospital beds. Work has begun on additional temporary hospital sites including a 600 bed capacity nursing home facility in Brooklyn and numerous floors of a high rise building on Wall Street. It’s been really a pretty amazing what they’ve done, the Army Corps of Engineers, what they’ve done."
2020-03-30,11:46,Donald Trump,"They just completed, think of it, a 2,900 bed hospital in New York in just about three days, maybe four days. And the whole city’s talking about it. On top of that, we floated in a great ship, which is going to be a thousand rooms, which is being used for patients outside of what we’re focused on and that will free up a lot of rooms for what we’re focused on. So it’s been great. The Army Corps of Engineers is awarded contracts for the construction of alternate care facilities also. At the State University at Stony Brook, State University Old Westbury and the Westchester Community Center, we’re sending 60 ambulances to New York City today. We have a total of 60 we’re getting some additional ones with up to 190 more to follow at different locations."
2020-03-30,12:46,Donald Trump,"To date, FEMA has obligated more than $1.3 billion dollars in federal support to the state of New York. We’re spending a lot of money in New York. It’s a hotbed, there’s no question about it. And we’re spending a lot of time, effort on New York, New Jersey. Spoke with governor Cuomo a lot, spoke with governor Murphy a lot in New Jersey, and we’re really getting the job done. People are very impressed and I’m very impressed by the people in FEMA, the people in the Army Corps of Engineers, because what they’ve done, I’ve never seen anybody doing anything like it."
2020-03-30,13:26,Donald Trump,"In addition to the 8,100 ventilators that we’ve already delivered, over the next 48 hours, we’re delivering more than 1000. 400 ventilators are going to Michigan very shortly. 300 going to New Jersey, 150 ventilators to Illinois, 150 to Louisiana and 50 to Connecticut. FEMA and HHS already delivered 11.6 million N95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns and 22 million gloves. And I don’t know if you just saw, it just came over the wires that Ford just announced, just a little while ago, that they will produce along with General Electric Healthcare, 50,000 ventilators, and they’re going to be doing it in less than 100 days."
2020-03-30,14:24,Donald Trump,"And top of that, we have other companies that are doing ventilators, including General Motors, but we have a nine other companies doing ventilators. As we outpace what we need, we’re going to be sending them to Italy, we’re going to be sending them to France. We’re going to be sending them to Spain, where they have tremendous problems and other countries as we can. But the fact that we’re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies. More than 14,000 National Guard members have been activated and can help supplement state and local…"
2020-03-30,15:03,Donald Trump,"… Have been activated and can help supplement state and local efforts to distribute personal protective equipment where we’re sending a lot. We have plane loads coming in. We have 51 loads from various locations all around the world and they’re landing. We had our first big cargo plane land this morning and we’re getting it from all over the world and we’re also sending things that we don’t need to other parts. I just spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy and we have additional capacity. We have additional product that we don’t need. We’re going to be sending approximately a hundred million dollars worth of things, of surgical and medical and hospital things to Italy and Giuseppe was very, very happy. I will tell you that they haven’t a very hard time."
2020-03-30,15:55,Donald Trump,"Joining us this afternoon are CEOs of the great American companies that are fulfilling their patriotic duty by producing or donating medical equipment to help meet our most urgent needs. What they’re doing is incredible and these are great companies. Darius Adamczyk of Honeywell, you know that, and Darius has been somebody that I’ve dealt with in the past and he’s a great leader of a great company."
2020-03-30,16:23,Donald Trump,"Debra Waller of Jockey International. A friend of mine, Mike Lindell of MyPillow. Boy, do you sell those pillows? That’s unbelievable what you do. David Taylor of Procter and Gamble and Greg Hayes of United Technologies Corporation and I just want to tell all of you that America’s very grateful to you and what you’ve done. Amazing job you’ve done and we thank you very much."
2020-03-30,16:49,Donald Trump,"I’d like you to come up and say a couple of words if you might about your companies. Mike, come on up. Come on up fellas. Please come on up. You have to say what you’re doing because it’s been really incredible. Go ahead, Mike."
2020-03-30,17:05,Mike Lindell,"MyPillow is a US vertically integrated company, which has been forced to adjust to the changing business environment as a result of the pandemic. MyPillow is uniquely positioned as a US company that functions as a manufacturer, logistics management distributor and direct to consumer."
2020-03-30,17:24,Mike Lindell,"Given our current business lines, we are experiencing the effects of this pandemic firsthand but MyPillow has done and established internal task force, which is monitoring future needs of companies across the country as a result of this pandemic and given our position, we began to research and develop new protocols to address the current and future needs of US businesses across multiple sectors."
2020-03-30,17:48,Mike Lindell,How companies are going to prepare themselves when they once again open up and changes to their current operations in order to adjust to future threats and pandemics. MyPillow has designated some of its call center to help US companies navigate the many issues that resulted from this pandemic.
2020-03-30,18:04,Mike Lindell,"We’ve dedicated 75% of my manufacturing to produce cotton face masks. I’m up to time, in three days I was up to 10,000 a day. By Friday, I want to be up to 50,000 a day. I’m proud to manufacture our products in the United States and I’m even more proud to be able to serve our nation in this great time of need."
2020-03-30,18:24,Mike Lindell,"Thank you Mr. President for your call to action which has empowered companies like MyPillow to help our nation win this invisible war. Now, I wrote something off the cuff, if I can read this."
2020-03-30,18:36,Mike Lindell,"God gave us grace on November 8, 2016, to change the course we were on. God had been taken out of our schools and lives. A nation had turned his back on God and I encourage you to use this time at home to get back in the Word, read our Bibles and spend time with our families. Our president gave us so much hope, where just a few short months ago, we had the best economy, the lowest unemployment and wages going up. It was amazing. With our great president, vice president, and this administration and all the great people in this country praying daily, we will get through this and get back to a place that’s stronger and safer than ever."
2020-03-30,19:19,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike. Please come on up. I did not know he was going to do that but he’s a friend of mine and I do appreciate it. Thank you, Mike, very much. Please."
2020-03-30,19:31,Darius Adamczyk,"First of all, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, the entire administration and all the agencies, thank you for your strong leadership during this time of crisis. It is noticed and it’s making a difference."
2020-03-30,19:43,Darius Adamczyk,"Second of all, I’d like to say a big thank you to all the healthcare workers out there. You’re putting yourself in harms way every day and we really respect what you’re doing and we couldn’t be thankful enough for it and I can tell you that more helps on the way. We as Honeywell, we’re an industrial technology company and one of the businesses that we’re in, protecting industrial worker. But what we’re doing today is we’re repurposing a lot of that equipment to serve the healthcare worker."
2020-03-30,20:11,Darius Adamczyk,A few days ago we announced the start-up of a new manufacturing facility in Rhode Island. We’re going to be hiring 500 employees. We have already 200 onboard and we’re going to be starting the production N95 masks within the next two weeks.
2020-03-30,20:27,Darius Adamczyk,"Furthermore, today we’re announcing the start up of another manufacturing facility in Arizona. We’re going to be hiring another 500 people and we’re going to be starting up production in that facility by the middle of May. So in total, we’ve doubled our production of N95 masks already. It’s going to double again within the next 60 days and then within the next 90 days, we’re one of the 5X the capacity we do today. Furthermore, we’re going to be providing other safety equipment to support all the efforts going on. Lastly, I would say a big thing, key to all the Honeywell employees and also announce a $10 million fund for them for all the hourly and administrative employees are having a hard time during this time of crisis. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-03-30,21:15,Donald Trump,"Fantastic. Thank you. Normally I’d shake his hand but we’re not supposed to do that anymore. So that’s okay. Great job. Thank you to Honeywell. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-30,21:29,Debra Waller,"Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President on your guidance during this unprecedented time and I’m very honored to be here today. Founded by a minister 144 years ago, Jockey International is a family owned company headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin."
2020-03-30,21:46,Debra Waller,"Since 1876, we have been providing socks and underwear for generations of families. It is part of our DNA to roll up our sleeves and help our country in her time of need. During World War II, we made parachutes for the military and today we are eager to serve this great country by providing support for the healthcare workers on the front lines of this fight."
2020-03-30,22:09,Debra Waller,"As the president and vice president have said, it’s a whole of America approach and we are committed. Jockey has had a long standing partnership with Encompass Group, headquartered in Georgia, serving the healthcare community. When we learned of the critical need for PPE, we knew we had to help. That meant restarting production on tier three isolation gowns."
2020-03-30,22:33,Debra Waller,"Monumental lifting by Jockey, Encompass, FEMA and the FDA was done in just a few days to be production ready. As a result, we expect to begin delivering 30 to 50,000 gowns per week, helping those that need it the most right now."
2020-03-30,22:51,Debra Waller,"In addition, this week we are also donating 10,000 units of scrubs to the frontline doctors and nurses at the Javits Convention Center in New York City. We would not have been able to do this without the collaboration of the administration, representatives from the federal agencies and Congressman Brian Stiles."
2020-03-30,23:11,Debra Waller,Thank you very much Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.
2020-03-30,23:14,Donald Trump,Thank you very much.
2020-03-30,23:22,David Taylor,"Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice President for bringing us together today. I’m proud to be able to represent the men and women of Proctor and Gamble who every day, 24 hours a day, are working to build and make essential cleaning products, hygiene products and healthcare products for families everywhere. These include healthcare workers and for institutions that are serving those in the front line. P and G people are the faces of the brands you know and trust. Brands like Tide, Pampers, Bounty, Charmin, Mr. Clean and Vicks."
2020-03-30,23:56,David Taylor,"In addition to making, packing and shipping these essential items, they’ve worked together to transform our plants to make things we’ve never made before like hand sanitizers and facial mask. Some of these are already getting to national, state and local agencies. Some of them are in the hospitals already. Everywhere around the world, P and G people are working every day to serve everybody, consumers and they’re working together to bring together the full capability of our research and development, our engineering, our manufacturing and our communications capability to make sure we make a difference to the consumers we serve and to all the audience that we can make a difference to."
2020-03-30,24:40,David Taylor,I want to thank them and I’m very grateful for what they do every day in service to others. Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President for bringing us together today.
2020-03-30,24:49,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-03-30,24:55,Greg Hayes,"Good afternoon. I’m Greg Hayes from United Technologies and on behalf of the 240,000 employees of United Technologies and the 70,000 employees at Raytheon, which will join together with UTC this Friday, I want to first of all say thank you to the president and the vice president for your leadership during what is really a war."
2020-03-30,25:14,Greg Hayes,"It was a different war than anybody has ever fought before, but it’s a war that we’re uniquely qualified to help. As one of the world’s largest defense contractors and some of the best technology, we’re using that technology to try and solve some real world problems."
2020-03-30,25:28,Greg Hayes,Today we’re working with the Air Force to try and help the pilots as they’re moving medical evacuees with the COVID-19 virus such that they can be protected and that the patients can be protected.
2020-03-30,25:39,Greg Hayes,"Again, we’re working also with logistics and if you think about a war, strategy is important but logistics wins war. It’s imperative I think with FEMA and along with Mr. Navarro’s office, that we coordinate all of these activities."
2020-03-30,25:53,Greg Hayes,"Last week we donated about 90,000 pieces of personal protective equipment to FEMA. Next week we’ll have another almost million, again working through our supply chain partners around the world. We’re also today, this week, beginning the manufacture of face shields using the additive technologies that we have and the machines that we have available within UTC, we’ll be able to produce approximately 10,000 shields in the next four weeks. Again, all needed equipment."
2020-03-30,26:20,Greg Hayes,"We stand ready to help in any way we can. We don’t need the Defense Production Act to ask us to act. All of the people at UTC and Raytheon are focused on this war and winning it. Again, I also want to say thank you to all of our employees for their work during this crisis, as well as to the frontline medical and other first responders. Thank you very much."
2020-03-30,26:40,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Thank you. Fantastic. Great company.
2020-03-30,26:43,Donald Trump,"Those a great companies. Thank you very much. I’d like to ask Seema to come up and say a few words about what you’re doing and what’s happening and how positive it’s been. I really appreciate it. Come on up, Seema Verma."
2020-03-30,26:58,Seema Verma,Thank you Mr. President and let me start by saying I want to convey my deepest sympathies to those that have lost loved ones to the Coronavirus. We’re all thinking of you.
2020-03-30,27:09,Seema Verma,"Today’s Doctor’s Day and even without it, I want to send a message of gratitude to the foot soldiers in this war; men and women that are providing care and comfort to Americans that have been affected by the virus. Your country is grateful and in short, as the president has said, we are engaged in a war against an invisible enemy. In war time, the assumptions of peace time must be revisited and adjusted to meet the demands of the moment."
2020-03-30,27:37,Seema Verma,"And so under the president’s leadership, CMS is waving a wide and unprecedented range of regulatory requirements. Now many healthcare systems won’t need these waivers and they shouldn’t use them if they don’t need them but the flexibilities are there. In a time of crisis, regulations shouldn’t stand in the way of patient care and there are several components to our announcement today but the first one is CMS’s hospital’s without walls and this is going to allow hospital systems to create new treatment sites outside of their facility, to expand capacity and be able to safely separate patients that are infected with the Coronavirus and those that are not."
2020-03-30,28:19,Seema Verma,"Now FEMA is doing incredible work setting up temporary hospitals in New York and other areas but under these waivers, we are empowering local communities to compliment and augment the work of FEMA in allowing hospital systems to tap into the capacity that already exist in their communities, making use of dorms and hotels or gymnasiums and allowing the main hospital to focus on those that need the most intensive care."
2020-03-30,28:46,Seema Verma,There are surgery centers out there today that are delaying elective surgeries and they may have excess capacity that could be devoted to hospital light care.
2020-03-30,28:57,Seema Verma,We are also making changes to the Medicare program to facilitate testing. So some people that need a coronavirus test can’t leave their home or patients that are in a nursing home and now we will pay for labs to go out to these locations and perform testing.
2020-03-30,29:12,Seema Verma,We’re also expanding the workforce. We are taking action today to relax some of our regulations to allow hospitals to increase their workforce and we’re allowing a broad range of flexibilities so that we can let healthcare workers operate at the top of their license.
2020-03-30,29:33,Seema Verma,"We are also allowing our hospitals to provide more support for our healthcare workers. Under today’s regulations, they can only provide minimal support to healthcare workers but now we’re going to allow them to provide childcare, meals, laundry services."
2020-03-30,29:49,Seema Verma,Then there’s also telehealth. The president already directed a dramatic expansion of telehealth to our nation’s 62 million seniors with Medicare and we’re so proud of all the healthcare providers and patients that have rapidly implemented…
2020-03-30,30:03,Seema Verma,"… care, healthcare providers and patients that have rapidly implemented telehealth. But today we’re announcing that we’re going to go even further and we’re going to be paying for doctors to make phone calls with their patients and provide care over the phone. And we’re getting rid of longstanding barriers to telehealth in the Medicare program allowing emergency rooms to use telehealth and eliminating requirements that some visits be provided face to face. And I also want to mention that on Saturday, the president directed CMS to offer advanced payments for healthcare providers that are experiencing cashflow problems."
2020-03-30,30:35,Seema Verma,"We know that many providers are complying with our recommendations to delay non-essential elective surgeries and they shouldn’t be penalized for doing the right thing. Now, I’ve barely scratched the surface of all the flexibilities that we are offering healthcare workers and healthcare systems. These flexibilities will provide a lot of flexibility from regulations that are ill suited to the unprecedented needs of this emergency and doctors and nurses and other healthcare professionals that are working long hours and sacrificing times with their families and risking their lives will have the flexibility that they need to confront the needs of the coronavirus pandemic."
2020-03-30,31:17,Seema Verma,"And there are many heroes in this war, but I want to take an opportunity to thank the team at CMS. These folks have worked day and night. The flexibilities that are in this regulation and any regulation usually take CMS a year. But we did this in two weeks and I couldn’t be more honored and privileged to serve alongside these dedicated public servants. Thank you."
2020-03-30,31:40,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. You were fantastic [inaudible 00:31:42], and you’re doing a great job. So we are in the midst of something that is very difficult but we are going to win. It’s just a question of when. We want to do it as quickly as possible. We want to have as few deaths as possible and we will meet again tomorrow for some statistics and some updates as to where we are, where we think we’re going, and timing. I think timing is going to be very important because we have to get our country back. We have to get our country back to where it was and maybe beyond where it was because we’ve learned so much, but we will have lost a lot of people and in many ways they hear us."
2020-03-30,32:26,Donald Trump,"And if you look at what’s happening with our medical professionals, it’s a danger there. They’re warriors. Men and women are doing a job the likes of which I don’t think anyone’s ever seen. I see them coming out of planes today going into New York, going into the most dangerous locations, dangerous areas. And they go in there and they just want to do the job. And you see the numbers, you see the numbers, I see the numbers. I have some friends that are unbelievably sick. We thought they were going in for a mild stay and in one case, he’s unconscious in a coma. And you say, how did that happen?"
2020-03-30,33:08,Donald Trump,"So I just want to thank all of the great professionals, men and women, doctors and nurses and paramedics and fast responders and law enforcement. By the way, if you look at New York and you see the effect that this had on law enforcement, it’s been incredible. These are great people, firefighters, great people. They’re helping in so many different ways. So thank you very much. And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. John, please."
2020-03-30,33:34,John (Reporter),"Thank you Mr President. Yesterday you said that you would be extending the guidelines through the end of April and that you’ll be giving us specifics tomorrow. Do you expect that the guidelines will just carry on the guidelines that have been in place now for 15 days? Could there potentially be some modification? Also, you have some travel restrictions that come up for reconsideration. The one from the EU on April 13th, Canada, US-Mexico border on April the 21st, well, what will happen with all of that?"
2020-03-30,34:08,Donald Trump,"They’ll be staying, and we may add a few more, but the guidelines will be very much as they are, maybe even toughened up a little bit, but they’re having a big impact. They are having a tremendous impact and we’re starting to see it. And that’s the key, we’re starting to see the impact that they’re having."
2020-03-30,34:22,John (Reporter),"And if I could ask you too, you talked about Ford now ramping up production of ventilators. The government is sending thousands of ventilators across the country. Clearly the supply is increasing, but when you look at the production curve against the hospitalization curve, can you guarantee that everyone who needs a ventilator in the next few weeks will be able to get one?"
2020-03-30,34:44,Donald Trump,"Well, I think that some are ramping up to a level that they’re not going to have to, John, and I think that we also have kept in reserve. We have almost 10,000 ventilators in our line. We’ve held back just because we did the stockpile, we didn’t want to give them because we don’t know where the emergency… it hits so fast. It comes so quickly, and we have 10,000. We’re probably going to send some of them now. We’ve been sending a lot to Michigan and various other states. We’ll probably send some additional ones to Michigan. New York’s been doing very well, but we can add some more to New York. We’re adding them to the areas that are having a problem."
2020-03-30,35:23,Donald Trump,"Even Alabama, all of a sudden a flared up a little bit as you saw over the last couple of days and we’ll send them down to Alabama. So we have 10,000, we kept them for this very specific purpose. It sounds like a lot, but it’s not when you think about it, but we’re making a lot and when you see, we’re talking about hundreds of thousands being made in a very short period of time because if you look at what just… so we have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators. And we say go ahead because honestly, other countries really, they’ll never be able to do it. It’s a complex piece of equipment and it’s big and expensive."
2020-03-30,36:00,John (Reporter),So do you believe as we approach this peak in a couple of weeks that there will be enough for the American populace?
2020-03-30,36:05,Donald Trump,"Yes. I do think so. I think we’re going to be in very good shape, and we had a great call today with the governors and they were, I actually said, “I hope that the media is listening to this call,” because it was a really good call and that was randomly selected largely Democrats and Republicans in there. I think for the most part they were saying thank you for doing a great job and we discussed that at the end of the call. So really, people are very happy with what we’re doing. Now the circumstances are so terrible because of what’s going on, but I think they’re very impressed by the Federal government."
2020-03-30,36:45,Donald Trump,"I watched that beautiful ship floating in today into, weeks ahead of schedule, almost four weeks ahead of schedule into New York Harbor, Comfort. And I watched the Mercy floating in to Los Angeles a week ago, almost a week ago. And they are stocked. They are really ready to go. They’re stocked with both talent and tremendous amounts of equipment and the Navy and everybody else involved, they got it ready so fast. It’s just incredible what they can do. They’ve geared up. That’s why I mean, I am so impressed by the people involved. Mike and I were talking about it before, the level of genius to put it all together so quickly. A month ago nobody ever heard of this. Nobody had any idea that Mercy was being maintained."
2020-03-30,37:33,Donald Trump,"It was in maintenance for a month. And when they heard we needed it, and I was surprised, they said, “Sir, we’re ready to go.” I said, “What do you mean? You’re not going to be ready for three weeks?” “No sir, we’re all ready to go.” It was incredible. And we’ve had many instances like this. I think the building of the hospital, 2,900 beds in a matter of days, a few days is just incredible. Governor Cuomo was impressed and Gavin Newsome was impressed by what we’ve been doing with Gavin in California in Los Angeles area in particular, but really San Francisco, all over, all over California. When you look at what we’re doing with Michigan, we’re getting along very well with Michigan’s, great place. We’re sending a lot of things to Michigan because that’s becoming a hotbed, especially a specific area as you know, it’s become very hot."
2020-03-30,38:24,Donald Trump,"It’s become, I don’t know, could even at some point supersede, but it’s got to be taken care of. So the relationship we have with the governors, I just wish you could… because we took a lot of calls from a lot of different states and I wish you could have heard, even a thing where the governor of Ohio calls where he has a company that does the sterilization, but they have a problem because it’s not going quickly at the FDA. And I call up Steve and Steve comes and he said, “We’ll get it done.” And they checked it and they got it done almost immediately. And originally they were approving it for 10,000 masks and then it was supposed to be for 80 and they ultimately approved it for 120,000. I mean, it’s a tremendous number."
2020-03-30,39:10,Donald Trump,"And I kept wondering, why aren’t they sterilizing these masks? I assumed maybe you couldn’t do it, but then I’d look at them and they’d look like it’s not cloth. It’s something that looks like it could be sterilized and that’s what they’ve done and that’s the machine that is over there actually. They have a piece of the machine over there. I won’t bother showing it to you. And this is incredible when you talk about five minutes, 15 minutes and highly accurate and not nearly as disturbing to do as the other tests. So we’ve just gotten better. We’re doing things that nobody else ever thought of. Please."
2020-03-30,39:44,Unnamed,"The DMV has issued today at home orders, but Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia took it pretty far. He issued a 70 day stay at home order. Is that constitutional first off? And secondly, do you think it’s warranted to go ahead and issue a 70 day guidance at this point?"
2020-03-30,40:03,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re letting the governors do in their states pretty much what they want with our supervision and they consult with us in all cases. Some go further than others as you know. I mean, I could give you plenty of examples, but I’m not going to do that because we never want to be controversial, but some of the governors have taken it a step further-"
2020-03-30,40:24,Unnamed,Did he consult [inaudible 00:40:25]?
2020-03-30,40:26,Donald Trump,"… and people are questioning that, but look, staying at home with respect to what we’re talking about doesn’t bother me at all. People should be staying at home. That’s what we want. [inaudible 00:40:35] please. [inaudible 00:40:37]."
2020-03-30,40:38,Unnamed,"2,405 Americans have died from coronavirus in the last 60 days. Meanwhile, you have 2,369 children who are killed by their mothers through elective abortions each day. That’s 16 and a half thousand children killed every week. Two states have suspended elective abortion to make more resources available for coronavirus cases, that’s Texas and Ohio. Do you agree with states who are placing coronavirus victims above elective abortions and should more states be doing the same?"
2020-03-30,41:12,Donald Trump,"Well, I think what we’re doing is we’re trying to, as a group, governors and that’s Republicans and Democrats, we’re just working together to solve this problem. What you’re mentioning has been going on for a long time and it’s a sad event, a lot of sad events in this country, but what we’re doing is now we’re working on the virus, we’re working on that hidden enemy and I think we’re doing a great job on, as good a job as you can possibly do. When when Tony and Deborah came up with numbers yesterday to say that if we did nothing, you could lose 2.2, up to 2., maybe beyond, I don’t know, maybe beyond, but 2.2 million people if we did nothing. And I can’t tell you what the unfortunate final toll is going to be, but it’s going to be a very small fraction of that."
2020-03-30,42:01,Donald Trump,So we’re doing an awfully good job I think with what we’re doing. Please go ahead.
2020-03-30,42:06,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:42:06] in Ohio.
2020-03-30,42:06,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-30,42:10,Unnamed,"Are you considering all a nationwide stay at home order? I know there’s a lot of states that have put them in place, but some haven’t. I’m just wondering if you were considering some sort of broad stay at home order. And then I have a question for Dr. Birx too, if you don’t mind."
2020-03-30,42:21,Donald Trump,"Well, we’ve talked about it. Obviously there are some parts of the country that are in far deeper trouble than others. There are other parts that frankly are not in trouble at all. So hopefully, we’re going to be able to keep it that way by doing what we’re doing. So we talked about quarantine as you know, the other day a group came to me and they wanted to do the quarantine and I said, “Let’s think about it.” And we did it, we studied it. And by the time the evening came, it just was something that was very unwieldy, very tough to enforce and something we didn’t want to do. But we did advisory. And I think that’s doing well. I mean, I look at the streets, you look at New York where there’s… I looked down Fifth Avenue today, they were showing a shot of Fifth Avenue in Primetime and there was almost nobody on Fifth Avenue."
2020-03-30,43:09,Donald Trump,"I’ve never seen that before. There was no car, there was no anything. So I think the people of this country have done an incredible job. If we do that, we will let you know. But it’s pretty unlikely I would think at this time."
2020-03-30,43:22,Unnamed,Can I ask a quick question for Dr. Birx [inaudible 00:43:23]?
2020-03-30,43:23,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-30,43:24,Unnamed,"So Dr. Birx, if you don’t mind, you had mentioned today that this model that predicts 100, 000 deaths is if we do things almost perfectly. So I wanted to know, are we currently doing things almost perfectly or are there more things we need to be doing to not exceed that 100,000, 200,000 model."
2020-03-30,43:46,Donald Trump,Please come.
2020-03-30,43:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. Thank you. I think that’s a really great question. And tomorrow we’ll go through all of the graphs and all the information that we took to the president for the decision. But when you… and I just want to thank the data team that’s working day and night to get, I mean, I usually get my data about 2:00 AM from them and they assimilate all the data from all the states. And when you look at all of the states together, all of them are moving in exactly the same curves. And so that’s why we really believe this needs to be federal guidance so that every state understands that it may look like two cases today, that become 20, that become 200, that become 2000. And that’s what we’re trying to prevent. And I think states still have that opportunity, but they’re going to have to do all of these recommended… I mean, these recommendations are recommendations that the globe is using."
2020-03-30,44:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so we really do recommend that every governor, every mayor, looks very carefully and ensures that their communities are utilizing these guidance."
2020-03-30,44:55,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Thanks. It is amazing. You look at Louisiana and for a long time it was just staying at-
2020-03-30,45:03,Donald Trump,"For a long time, it was just staying at nothing. And then all of a sudden, I look one day and I see a lot and a lot and a lot, and then it explodes. And now, we’re working very carefully and very powerfully with them. We’re building hospitals, we’re building a lot of different things for Louisiana. So, it’s very important. Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-03-30,45:24,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Dr. Fauci has warned that this could be seasonal cyclical virus. So… And maybe both of you could comment on this and Dr. Birx as well, are you prepared for this to strike again, say in the fall? All the efforts that are taking place right now to contain this, to be proactive, and you-"
2020-03-30,45:44,Donald Trump,"Yeah. We’re prepared, I hope it doesn’t happen. Doctor, would you like to say something about that? I hope it doesn’t happen, but we’re certainly prepared."
2020-03-30,45:53,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"In fact, I would anticipate that that would actually happen because of the degree of transmissibility. However, if you come back in the fall, it will be a totally different ballgame of what happened when we first got hit with it, in the beginning of this year. There’ll be several things that will be different. Our ability to go out and be able to test, identify, isolate and contact trace, will be orders of magnitude better than what it was just a couple of months ago. In addition, we have a number of clinical trials that are looking at kind of variety of therapeutic interventions. We hope one or more of them will be available."
2020-03-30,46:29,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And importantly, as I mentioned to you many times at these briefings is that, we have a vaccine that’s on track and multiple other candidates. So I would anticipate that a year to year and a half, we’d be able to do it under an emergency use. If we start seeing an efficacy signal, we may be able to even use a vaccine at the next season. So things are going to be very different. What we’re going through now, is going to be more than just lessons to learn, it’s going to be things that we have available to us that we did not have before."
2020-03-30,47:02,Donald Trump,"Okay. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-30,47:04,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Scott… Thank you. Scott Gottlieb, your former FDA Commissioner, wrote a roadmap for recovery after the Coronavirus."
2020-03-30,47:12,Donald Trump,"Yeah, very interesting, I saw it."
2020-03-30,47:13,Unnamed,He suggests… The roadmap suggests that everybody wear a mask in public. Is that something that the task force thinks is a good idea?
2020-03-30,47:23,Donald Trump,"Well, we haven’t discussed it to that extent, but it’s certainly something we could discuss. We’re getting certainly the number of masks that you need. We are in the process of talking about things… I saw his suggestion on that, so we’ll take a look at it. For a period of time, not forever. I mean, we want our country back. We’re not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear. People could… I could see something like that happening for a period of time. But I would hope it would be a very limited period of time, doctors. They’ll come back and say, for the rest of our lives we have to wear masks."
2020-03-30,48:00,Unnamed,"The roadmap also talks about doing GPS for social distancing, maybe following people’s phones, and hotels for isolation for people, giving them free hotel rooms, are those ideas that you’re looking at?"
2020-03-30,48:14,Donald Trump,"Well, the GPS, that’s the very severe idea. I’ve been hearing about it, GPS. So, what happens? A siren goes off if you get too close to somebody. That’s pretty severe. But he’s somebody who was with me for a long time. He worked… They did a great job at FDA. So, we’re going to take a look. I just received it a little while ago, he sent it over. So very good. Go ahead. Let’s give it a shot."
2020-03-30,48:36,Jim Acosta,"Sir, what do you say to Americans who are upset with you over the way you downplayed this crisis over the last couple of months?"
2020-03-30,48:44,Donald Trump,Here we go.
2020-03-30,48:45,Jim Acosta,"We have it very much under control in this country. The Coronavirus is very much under control, in the USA. It’s going to disappear. It’s like a miracle. It will disappear. March 4th, we have a very small number of people in this country infected. March 10th, we’re prepared. We’re doing a great job with it. It will go away. Just stay calm, it will go away. What do you say to Americans who believe that you got this wrong?"
2020-03-30,49:08,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:00:49:06], it will go away. And I do want them to stay calm. And we are doing a great job. If you look at those individual statements, they’re all true. Stay calm, it will go away. You know it is going away and it will go away, and we’re going to have a great victory. And it’s people like you and CNN that say things like that, that… It’s why people just don’t want to listen to CNN anymore. You could ask a normal question. The statements I made are, I want to keep the country calm, I don’t want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you. I could do much… I would make you look like a minor league player. But you know what? I don’t want to do that. I want to have our country be calm and strong and fight and win. And it will go away."
2020-03-30,49:50,Donald Trump,"And it is incredible the job that all of these people are doing, putting them all together, the job that they’re doing. I am very proud of the job they’re doing, that Mike Pence is doing, that the task force has done, that Honeywell and Procter & Gamble and Mike and all of these people have done. I’m very proud. It’s almost a miracle. And it is, the way it’s all come together. And instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question. And other than that, I’m going to go to somebody else. Please, go ahead. Please."
2020-03-30,50:23,Jim Acosta,[crosstalk 00:50:14].
2020-03-30,50:26,Unnamed,You expressed some concern in the past that medical supplies were going out the back door and that perhaps some hospitals were doing things [crosstalk 00:05:34].
2020-03-30,50:33,Donald Trump,"Well, I expressed what was told to me by a tremendous power in the business. He said that at a New York hospital, for a long period of time, he was giving 10,000, maybe maximum 20,000 masks, over a short time. And all of a sudden, he’s giving 300,000. And I said, “No matter how bad this is, could that be possible?” He said, “No.” So there’s only a couple of that could happen. Is it going out the back door? And I’ve reported it to the city, and let the city take a look at it. But when you go from 10,000 masks to 300,000 masks, Mike, over the same period of time, there’s something going on. Now, I’m not making any charges, but when everyone’s looking for masks… And by the way, that’s another thing, we’re making a lot of masks and the sterilization process is going to save a lot of time and a lot of masks."
2020-03-30,51:26,Donald Trump,"But, when you have the biggest distributor of product that distributes to many of the big hospitals and hospital chains, and he brings up a statistic like that… And I know you’re trying to make a big deal out of it, but you shouldn’t be. You should actually go over to the hospital and find out why. You shouldn’t be asking me. I’m just saying, that’s the way it is."
2020-03-30,51:47,Unnamed,Are you-
2020-03-30,51:47,Donald Trump,"You should go over there as a great reporter. I have no idea who you are, but that’s okay. You should go over there. Go to the hospital and find out, how come you used to get 10,000 masks and you had a full hospital? New York City always full. And how come now you have 300,000 masks? Despite the virus and all, you have three… How do you go from 10 to 300,000? And this is very serious stuff. I mean, I could see from 10 to 20 or from 10 to 40 or 50 or something, but how do you go from 10 to 300,000 masks? So what I think you should do as a… I’m sure you’re a wonderful investigative reporter, you should go to the hospital and find out why."
2020-03-30,52:27,Unnamed,"I’m asking your DOJ to look into it, sir."
2020-03-30,52:28,Donald Trump,"Steve, please."
2020-03-30,52:29,Steve (Reporter),[inaudible 00:52:29] challenging [inaudible 00:52:30] look like [crosstalk 00:52:34].
2020-03-30,52:34,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s so bad for the economy. But the economy is number two on my list. First, I want to save a lot of lives. We’re going to get the economy back. I think the economy is going to come back very fast. Steve is just asking about the economy, what’s it like? We basically shut down our country. And we did that in order to keep people separated, keep people apart. They’re not working in offices, they’re not in airplanes together. We’ve really shut it down. And 150/151 other countries are pretty much shut down. But here with the… We have the greatest economy in the world. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. And I had to go from doing a great job for three years, to shutting it down. But you know what? We’re going to build it up and we’re going to build it up rapidly. And I think in the end, we’ll be stronger for it. We learned a lot."
2020-03-30,53:26,Donald Trump,"And I have to say, we’ve had great relationships with a lot of countries. China sent us some stuff which was terrific. Russia sent us a very large plane load of things, medical equipment, which was very nice. Other countries sent us things that I was very surprised at. Very happily surprised. We learned a lot. We’re learning a lot. And we’re also learning, that the concept of borders is very important, Steve. It’s very important. Having borders is very important. But, we have done an incredible job. The economy is going to come back. My focus is saving lives. That’s the only focus I could have. We’re going to bring the economy back and we’ll bring it back fast. Yeah, please."

2020-03-30,54:14,Unnamed,Mr. [Inaudible 00:54:15].
2020-03-30,54:14,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-03-30,54:18,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve said several times that the United States is ramped up testing, so it’s to talk a little quicker or a little louder. Mr. President, you’ve said several times that the United States is ramped up testing, but the United States is still not testing per capita as many people as other countries like South Korea. Why is that and when do you think that that number will be on par with other countries? And Doctor-"
2020-03-30,54:39,Donald Trump,"Yeah. Well, it’s very much on par. Look-"
2020-03-30,54:42,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:54:42] per capita.
2020-03-30,54:43,Donald Trump,"Per capita. We have areas of country that’s very wide. I know South Korea better than anybody, it’s a very tight… You know how many people are in Seoul? You know how big the city of Seoul is?"
2020-03-30,54:52,Unnamed,The question-
2020-03-30,54:53,Donald Trump,"38 million people. That’s bigger than anything we have. 38 million people all tightly wound together. We have vast farmlands. We have vast areas where they don’t have much of a problem. In some cases, they have no problem whatsoever. We have done more tests. Well, I didn’t talk about per capita. We have done more tests by far than any country in the world, by far. Our testing is also better than any country in the world. And when you looking at that, as simple as that looks, that’s something that’s a game changer. And every country wants that, every country. So, rather than asking a question like that, you should congratulate the people that have done this testing. Because, we inherited this administration, inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn’t work. It was okay for a tiny small group of people. But, once you got beyond that, it didn’t work. We have built an incredible system to the fact, where we have now done more tests than any other country in the world. And now the technology is really booming."
2020-03-30,55:56,Donald Trump,"I just spoke to… Well, I spoke to a lot… I’m not going to even mention. I spoke to a number of different testing companies today. And the job that they’ve done and the job that they’re doing, is incredible. But when Abbott comes out and does this so quickly, it’s really unreal. In fact, one company, I have to say, that stands out in the job, and I think I can say this, I don’t want to insult anybody else, but Roche. Roche, is been incredible in the testing job they’ve done. And they’re ramping it up exponentially, it’s up. And you should be saying, congratulations, instead of asking a really snarky question, because I know exactly what you mean by that."

2020-03-30,56:41,Donald Trump,"You should be saying, congratulations to the men and women who have done this job, who have inherited a broken testing system and who have made it great. And if you don’t say it, I’ll say it. I want to congratulate all of the people, you have done a fantastic job. And we will see you all tomorrow, thank you very much. Thank you."
2020-03-30,56:59,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-03-31,01:36,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much everyone. Our country is in the midst of a great national trial, unlike any we have ever faced before. You all see it. You see it probably better than most. We’re at war with a deadly virus. Success in this fight will require the full absolute measure of our collective strength, love, and devotion. It’s very important. Each of us has the power through our own choices and actions to save American lives and rescue the most vulnerable among us. That’s why we really have to do what we all know is right. Every citizen is being called upon to make sacrifices. Every business is being asked to fulfill its patriotic duty. Every community is making fundamental changes to how we live, work and interact each and every day, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see this going on long into the future when this virus is gone and defeated."
2020-03-31,02:44,Donald Trump,"Some of the things we’re doing now will be very good practice for the future, including for not getting the flu, which is very devastating also. So some of what we’re learning now will live on into the future. I really believe that shaking hands or not shaking hands, washing hands all the time, staying a little apart. 15 days ago we published our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread of the virus. On Sunday, I announced that this campaign will be extended until April 30th. In a few moments, Dr. Birx will explain the data that formed the basis for our decision to extend the guidelines and Dr. Fauci will explain why it’s absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines for the next 30 days. It’s a matter of life and death, frankly. It’s a matter of life and death."
2020-03-31,03:46,Donald Trump,"I know our citizens will rise to the occasion and they already have sacrificed a lot. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We’re the greatest economy in the world. We had the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers that we’ve ever had by far, and in one instant we said we have no choice but to close it up. Just as Americans have always done, they will do a job like few have seen before and they’re proud to do it. And I see that there’s a great pride going on right now. Before we hear from our experts, we have a few other announcements."
2020-03-31,04:28,Donald Trump,"Today, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration announced further details on the paycheck protection program, which was made possible by the $2 trillion relief bill I signed into law last week. Nearly $350 billion in loans will soon be available through lending partners to help small businesses meet payroll and other expenses for up to two months. These loans will be forgiven as long as businesses keep paying their workers. This includes sole proprietors and independent contractors. Applications will be accepted starting this Friday, April 3rd. So on Friday, April 3rd, that’s when it begins."
2020-03-31,05:13,Donald Trump,"Earlier today, I spoke with leading internet and phone providers who are doing a tremendous job of keeping our internet and the lines of communication flowing under very strongly increase strain the businesses more than anybody has seen before because everyone’s inside. They’re all making calls. Among the leaders I spoke to were Hans Vestberg a Verizon Communications, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Mike Sievert of T-Mobile, Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications, Brian Roberts of Comcast, John Malone of Liberty Media, Dexter Goie of Altice, Michel Combes of Sprint, and Aryeh Bourkoff of LionTree. Also Pat Esser of Cox Communications and Jeffrey Storey of CenturyLink. They’re doing an incredible job. If you look at other continents, if you look at Europe, they went a different route than we did and a much different route. We were talking about that just a little while ago, and they are having tremendous problems."
2020-03-31,06:32,Donald Trump,"Other countries are having problems, other continents are having problems, but with business at a level that nobody’s seen it before on the internet, it’s holding up incredibly well. And they expect that to continue no matter what happened, and no matter how much more gains, which it can gain more than it already is, I don’t know because they’re setting records. Let me also update you on the distribution of urgency needed resources and supplies and we have a lot of numbers. I’m going to let Mike Pence speak to that in a little while, but we’re giving massive amounts of medical equipment and supplies to the 50 states. We also are holding back quite a bit. We have almost 10,000 ventilators that we have ready to go. We have to hold them back because the surge is coming, and it’s coming pretty strong, and we want to be able to immediately move it into place without going and taking it."
2020-03-31,07:35,Donald Trump,"So we’re ready to go. And we’ve also distributed, I just spoke with governor of Michigan, had a great conversation and we sent a large number of ventilators to Michigan. We’re sending them to Louisiana. We sent additional ventilators to New York, additional ventilators to New Jersey. And I will say in New York, FEMA is supplying 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs to help respond to the increasing case load. That’s a lot of ambulances. In California, the Army Corps of engineers is developing eight facilities to expand hospital capacity up to 50,000 beds, 50,000. And had a great conversation last night with Gavin Newsom, he’s doing a really good job. We’re in constant communications. The USNS Mercy hospital ship is now operational. It’s in Los Angeles and receiving patients. And in New York, as you know, the Comfort, everybody watched that. It’s in place and it will be in a very short while receiving large numbers of patients over a thousand rooms and 12 operating rooms."
2020-03-31,08:56,Donald Trump,"FEMA has also provided a hundred travel trailers to assist with housing needs and we’re ordering hundreds more. In Michigan, FEMA will soon deliver in addition to the ventilators, 250 bed, field, hospital, and Army Corps of engineers is evaluating locations to build alternate care facilities. So we’re doing a field hospital in Michigan of 250 beds and we may be doubling it up soon depending on the need. They’re doing a good job with beds in Michigan, but they may need more than the 250, so FEMA and the Army Corps of engineers are prepared to go there quickly and get it done. In Louisiana, we’re delivering two field hospitals to provide 500 new hospital beds. I’ve been talking with the governor, John Bel Edwards and the Army Corps of engineers has been really doing incredible work establishing 3000 alternate care site at the New Orleans Convention Center, which will be operational, believe it or not this week."
2020-03-31,10:06,Donald Trump,"So we’re doing the 3000 bed alternate care site and we’re also doing a 500 bed new hospital, and that’s in Louisiana, which really got hit. It started off very late and it was looking good, and then all of a sudden it just reared up, came from nowhere. In addition to the supplies we’re delivering, we’re also giving hospitals the flexibility to use new facilities, including surgical care centers to care for hospital patients who are not infected. For example, I know that many expectant mothers are understandably concerned about exposing their newborn babies to the virus and they should be/ with our action yesterday, hospitals now have the authority to create special areas for mothers to deliver their babies in a very safe and healthy environment. Totally separate."
2020-03-31,11:03,Donald Trump,"Over the past two months, the US State Department has organized one of the largest and most complex international evacuation operations in American history. Mike Pompeo is working around the clock along with Ambassador O’Brien. Since January 29th, we have successfully repatriated over 25,000 Americans from more than 50 countries where they were literally stuck. In some cases, locked in. And I salute the incredible public servants at the Department of State as well as their counterparts at DHS and HHS who have played such an important role in doing this. You probably read about the young people in Peru, and young people in Brazil, and they were absolutely stuck and we got them out. Almost everybody is out now back home with their parents, their wives, their husbands."
2020-03-31,12:06,Donald Trump,"I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead. We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks. And then hopefully as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting I after having studied it so hard, you’re going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel, but this is going to be a very painful, very, very painful two weeks. When you look and see at night the kind of death that’s been caused by this invisible enemy, it’s incredible. I was watching last night, Governor Murphy of New Jersey say 29 people died today, meaning yesterday, and others talking about numbers far greater, but you get to know a state, I know New Jersey so well. And you hit 29 people and hundreds in other locations, hundreds in other states. And this is going to be a rough two week period."
2020-03-31,13:05,Donald Trump,"As a nation, we face a difficult few weeks as we approach that really important day when we’re going to see things get better all of a sudden. And it’s going to be like a burst of light. I really think and I hope that our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried, but America will answer with love and courage and ironclad resolve. This is the time for all Americans to come together and do our part. I appreciate a lot of the media. We’ve had a lot of really good things said. I think only good things can be said when you look at the job that’s been done. I just spoke with Franklin Graham who is an extraordinary person and a Samaritan’s Purse has been like so many others just been amazing and so fast. They did it so fast. He’s been doing that for a long time, but I think people are really seeing what they have done. Franklin Graham, very special family."
2020-03-31,14:13,Donald Trump,"As we send plane loads of masks and gloves and supplies to the communities battling the plague, and that’s what it is. It’s a plague. We also send our prayers. We pray for the doctors and the nurses. For the paramedics and the truck drivers, and the police officers, and the sanitation workers. And above all, the people fighting for their lives in New York and all across our land. I watched as doctors and nurses one into a certain hospital in Elmhurst this morning. I know Elmhurst, Queens, I grew up right next to it. I know the hospital very well, been seeing it all my life, my young life."
2020-03-31,14:57,Donald Trump,"And I will tell you that to see the scenes of trailers out there and what they’re doing with those trailers, they’re freezers and nobody could even believe it. And I spoke to some of my friends, they can’t believe what they’re seeing. And I watched the doctors and the nurses walking into that hospital this morning. It’s like military people going into battle, going into war. The bravery is incredible, and I just have to take my hat. I would take my hat if I were wearing a hat, I’d rip that hat off so fast and I would say “You people are just incredible.” They really are. They’re very brave. They’re going in and they don’t know, you have lots of things flying around in the air, you don’t know what you’re touching. Is it safe?"
2020-03-31,15:56,Donald Trump,"And you also see where your friends are going to the hospital and you say “How is he doing?” Two days later and they say, “Sir, he’s unconscious.” Or “He’s in a coma.” So things are happening that we’ve never seen before in this country. And with all of that being said, the country’s come together like I’ve never seen it before, and we will prevail, we will win, and hopefully it will be in a relatively short period of time. With that, I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and show you some of the latest data that has been, I think brilliantly put together. And right after that I’m going to ask Dr. Fauci to speak, and Mike Pence is going to give you some of the recent events that have taken place and some of the statistics that we have that I think will be very interesting here. Thank you very much. Please."
2020-03-31,16:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr. President. If I can have the first slide please. So always, and that’s what the slide is labeled, is goals of community mitigation. Really highlighting that this begins in the middle and the end with community. This community and the community of the American people that are going to have to do the things for the next 30 days to make a difference. I think you know from that large blue mountain that you can see behind me and I just want to thank the five or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial, who helped us tremendously. It was their models that created the ability to see what these mitigations could do, how steeply they could depress the curve from that giant blue mountain down to that more stippled area."
2020-03-31,17:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"In their estimates, they had between 1.5 million 2.2 million people in the United States succumbing to this virus without mitigation. Yet through their detailed studies and showing us what social distancing would do, what would happen if people stayed home, what would happen if people were careful every day to wash their hands and worry about touching their faces. That what an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these. And it takes us to that stippled mountain that’s much lower, a hill actually, down to 100,000-200,000 deaths, which is still way too much. Next slide please."
2020-03-31,18:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Simultaneously, there was a modeler out of the University of Washington that modeled from cases up, utilizing the experience around the globe to really understand how this information that we have from Italy and Spain and South Korea and China could really help us give insight into the hospital needs, the ventilator needs, and really the number of people who potentially could succumb to this illness. It is this model that we are looking at now that provides us the most detail of the time course that is possible, but this model assumes full mitigation."
2020-03-31,19:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It’s informed every morning or every night by the reality on the ground coming in from New York, New Jersey, and around the United States. And is modeled and informed every morning so that it is adjusted. So it is up to date every day. This is the model of the predicted fatalities and mortality in the United States and as the President said, it’s very much focused on the next two weeks and the stark reality of what this virus will do as it moves through communities. Next slide please. But this is a slide that gives us great hope and understanding about what is possible. On the bottom of the slide where you can barely see that blue line at the very bottom, that’s the current cases in California. The cumulative cases in California, where they’re doing significant testing. The next line up is Connecticut. The orange line is New Jersey. The blue line is New York. The yellow line is Washington. We all remember Washington state. It was just a month ago when they started to have the issues in Washington state, but they brought together their communities and their health providers and they put in strong mitigation methods and testing. And you can see what the result in Washington state and California is, but without the continuation for the next 30 days, anything could change. Next slide please."
2020-03-31,21:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I’m sure you’re interested in seeing all of the states. So on this slide is all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but I think it shows in stark reality the difference between New York and New Jersey and other states with similar populations and urban areas. Our goal over the next 30 days is to ensure the states that you see, the 48 across the bottom, maintain this lower level of new cases with the hope that we don’t have significant outbreaks in other states and other metro areas as the community comes together to work together and ensure that the health care providers around the globe and in the United States are strengthened by our resolve to continue to mitigate community by community."
2020-03-31,21:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"This is done community by community. We all know people are in their states and in their communities. And we’re very dependent on each person in the United States doing the same thing, following the presidential guidelines to a T. I know it’s a lot to ask because you’ve done it for 15 days. So if you can show the next slide please. So this is what gives us a lot of hope. This is the case finding in Italy. And you can see that they’re beginning to turn the corner in new cases. They’re entering their fourth week of full mitigation, and showing what is possible when we work together as a community, as a country, to change the course of this pandemic together. It is this graphic and the graphic of many of the states that gives us hope of what is possible with continuing for another 30 days."
2020-03-31,22:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Amidst all that hope, I must say that like we warned about Detroit and Chicago, we start to see changes in Massachusetts. New Orleans continues to be a problem of new cases, although they’re stabilizing. And I think it really shows the depth of dedication of the American people to the healthcare providers because they can see the strain that this puts on every nurse, doctor, respiratory therapists, pharmacist, and laboratory technician that’s working together to stem this tide of on relenting sick people coming to their doors. No one has been turned away. No one who has needed ventilation has not received ventilation. But you can see how stressful it is for each of them. So I know it’s stressful to follow the guidelines, but it is more stressful and more difficult to the soldiers on the front line. As we started and we will end, with its communities that will do this. There’s no magic bullet, there’s no magic vaccine or therapy. It’s just behaviors. Each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days. Thank you."
2020-03-31,24:15,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-03-31,24:15,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Dr. Birx, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. So what Dr. Birx has really said very simply is that there are really two dynamic forces that are opposing each other here. As I’ve mentioned several times in our briefings, the virus if left to its own devices will do that dark curve that Dr. Birx showed you. The other dynamic force is what we are doing, what we’re trying to do, and what we will do in the form of mitigation. Now these are very revealing bits of data because you saw what happened in Italy, where you make the turn around the curve and you go. That doesn’t happen all at once. It’s a stepwise fashion. And if I explained the steps, which I will, you’ll see why we are really convinced that mitigation is going to be doing the trick for us."
2020-03-31,25:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Because what you have is you have increase in new cases at a certain rate. When the increase in new cases begin to level off, the secondary effect is less hospitalizations. The next effect is less intensive care. And the next effect is less deaths. The deaths and the intensive care and the hospitalization always lag behind that early indication that there are less new cases per day. The way we saw in Italy, and the way we’re likely seeing, I don’t want to jump the gun on it. We’re seeing little inklings of this right now in New York."
2020-03-31,25:51,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So what we’re going to see, and now we got to brace ourselves. In the next several days to a week or so, we’re going to continue to see things go up. We cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working and will work. The slide that Dr. Birx showed, what you saw in New York and New Jersey, and then the cluster of other areas, our goal, which I believe we can accomplish, is to get the hotspot places, the New York’s, the New Jersey, and help them to get around that curve. But as importantly, to prevent those clusters of areas that have not yet gone to that spike, to prevent them from getting that spike."
2020-03-31,26:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And the answer to that is mitigation. Now, the 15 days that we had of mitigation clearly have had an effect, although it’s tough to quantitate it because of those two opposing forces. But the reason why we feel so strongly about the necessity of the additional 30 days is that now is the time whenever you’re having an effect, not to take your foot off the accelerator and on the brake, but to just press it down on the accelerator. And that’s what I hope and I know that we can do over the next 30 days. And as I said the other day on one of the interviews, we are a very strong and resilient nation. If you look at our history, we’ve been through some terrible ordeals. This is tough. People are suffering, people are dying. It’s inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this. But this is going to be the answer to our problems. So let’s all pull together and make sure as we look forward to the next 30 days, we do it with all the intensity and force that we can."
2020-03-31,28:00,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-03-31,28:01,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President and to the Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci. I know I speak on behalf of the President and people all across this country when I express our great admiration and appreciation to both of you for helping to steer our nation through this challenging time. The American people have now seen what the President saw when he made the decision at the end of 15 days to slow the spread, to ask the American people to give us 30 more days, to continue to put into practice the president’s Coronavirus guidelines for America."
2020-03-31,28:37,Mike Pence,"And as you just heard from the experts, we have reason to believe that it’s working. As Dr. Fauci just said, there are difficult days ahead. Our hearts and our prayers go out to the families that have lost loved ones. And those as the President’s just reflected who we know are struggling at this hour in hospitals across the nation. But to each and every one of us, do not be discouraged, because what you can do to protect your health, the health of your family, what you can do to ensure that our healthcare providers have the resources, and our hospitals have the capacity to meet this moment is put into practice the president’s Coronavirus guidelines for America."
2020-03-31,29:26,Mike Pence,"It really is what every American can do. 30 days to slow the spread. 30 days to make a difference in the lives of the American people, American families, and the life of our nation. Allow me to give you a few brief updates before the president takes questions. First and foremost, we continue to work very closely with governors around the nation. President and I spoke to all the governors, all the states and territories yesterday. And since we were last together, the President and I have spoken directly and to several governors around the country including Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, and others states."
2020-03-31,30:05,Mike Pence,"At the present moment, the President has declared 29 major disaster declarations and authorized 10 different states to use full federal funding, so-called Title 32 funding, to pay for their National Guard. And as of this afternoon, FEMA reports some 17,000 National Guard had been activated in states around the country to provide support for Coronavirus response. On the subject of testing, we have now completed more than 1.1 million tests around the country. We’re working very closely with governors around America to assist them in drive through and community testing centers. I spoke with governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois today about a testing center that they’ve established in cooperation with the US Public Health Service."
2020-03-31,30:55,Mike Pence,"We remind every governor and every laboratory and hospital in the country, it’s imperative that you continue to report daily to the CDC the results of those tests to give us the visibility on the data to best inform resource decisions. Also, we reiterated today to governors in person, and also through correspondence to every governor, the importance of using their National Guard if need be to move medical supplies. FEMA is very busy as you’ll hear in a moment, delivering literally millions of supplies to states around the country, but were urging every governor to make sure to work with their state emergency management team and maybe use the National Guard to move those supplies from warehouses to hospitals."
2020-03-31,31:43,Mike Pence,"At the present moment, as the President said, we’ve distributed more than 11.6 million N95 masks, more than 8,100 ventilators around the nation, millions of face shields, surgical masks, and gloves. We initiated an air bridge that the President announced yesterday. Flights have arrived in New York. One arrived in Illinois yesterday, and a flight will arrive in Ohio in the next 24 hours. FEMA is literally working and contracting around the world with now more than 51 flights that will be bringing vital medical supplies on the subject of ventilators, FEMA is currently delivering 400 ventilators to Michigan, 300 to New Jersey, 150 to Louisiana, 50 ventilators to Connecticut. And in the last week and in the week ahead, more than 450 ventilators to Illinois. This is in addition to more than 4,400 ventilators that the president and FEMA directed to the state of New York."
2020-03-31,32:44,Mike Pence,"We just want people that are working on the front lines, that the President just spoke about, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci spoke about, we want you to know, help is on the way. And at the President’s direction, we’re going to leave no stone unturned anywhere in America or anywhere in the world and make sure that you have the resources and the equipment to do your job. So again, I want to just say thank you America. Thank you for stepping up. Thank you for putting into practice the 15 days to slow the spread. And thank you for the response of tens of millions who have already had for the 30 days to slow the spread. We encourage each one of you as we have governors around the country to spread the word about the guidelines."
2020-03-31,33:27,Mike Pence,"Listen to your state and local authorities in areas that are more greatly impacted. We continue to urge people in the areas of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from travel around the country. And people who’ve traveled from that area, check your temperature and self quarantine for 14 days. You can see from that chart the unique challenges people in the greater New York city area are facing with the Coronavirus, and we want to do all that we can to protect your health, focus resources on our community, and prevent unnecessary spread. Lastly, as the president highlighted yesterday, businesses…"
2020-03-31,34:03,Mike Pence,"Necessary spread. Lastly, as the President highlighted yesterday, businesses around America are stepping up as never before. Tomorrow, I’ll travel with Secretary Sonny Purdue to Gordonsville, Virginia to the Walmart Distribution Center, just so the American people can see firsthand how the food supply is continuing to roll on 18 wheels and through air freight all over America, and we thank again the grocery store operators around America, and everybody that’s working out on the highways and byways every day to keep that food supply rolling and rolling strong."
2020-03-31,34:33,Mike Pence,"To the American people though, we just want to assure you that we’re going to continue to work our hearts out, work our hearts out to make sure our healthcare providers have everything they need, that anyone struggling with coronavirus has the support and healthcare they need, and I’m absolutely confident, seeing the way our governors are responding and seeing this team the President has assembled in the White House Coronavirus Task Force, confident of the prayers of the American people that we’ll get through this, but it will take all of us doing our part, and we’ll get through it together."
2020-03-31,35:09,Unnamed,"Just to be clear, what is the projected death toll? Should people be reasonably good at following these mitigation measures?"
2020-03-31,35:15,Donald Trump,"Well, are they reasonably good? I guess we could say that, I’d like to have maybe Dr. Fauci or Deb come up and say, but I have numbers, but I’d rather have them say the numbers if you don’t mind. It’s a big question."
2020-03-31,35:31,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So of course this is a projection and it’s a projection based on using very much what’s happened in Italy, and then looking at all the models, and so as you saw on that slide, that was our real number, that 100,000 to 200,000, and we think that that is the range. We really believe and hope every day that we can do a lot better than that, because that’s not assuming 100% of every American does everything that they’re supposed to be doing. But I think that’s possible."
2020-03-31,36:03,Unnamed,"Over the next two weeks, as you said, the next two weeks are going to be very painful as the bulk of it’s going to happen over the next two weeks."
2020-03-31,36:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You know, you’ll have an up slope, so as mortality, the fatalities to this disease will increase and then it will come back down, and it will come back down slower than the rate at which it went up. And so that is really the issue, how much we can push the mortality down."
2020-03-31,36:33,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So our hope is to get that down as far as we possibly can. The modeling that Dr. Birx showed predicts that number that you saw. We don’t accept that number that that’s what’s going to be. We’re going to be doing everything we can to get it even significantly below that. So, I don’t want it to be a mixed message. This is the thing that we need to anticipate, but that doesn’t mean that that’s what we’re going to accept. We want to do much, much better than that."
2020-03-31,37:03,Unnamed,"But doctor, when we look at the curve, it goes much further in time. So we would have death and cases for much longer. I mean, we do expect [inaudible 00:00:37:14]-"
2020-03-31,37:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, could you get up slide number two? So that’s a generic, I’m sorry if you can go back to the slides and put up slide two, okay, so what I showed you was a generic picture of what happens in an epidemic when you mitigate, so no mitigation, mitigate. This is based on the experience around the globe with this particular virus, and so it does have a tail, but the peak you can see by this projection, and this is the IHME data, the peak is over the next two weeks, and this is tracking mortality, so the number of fatalities from this virus, and so that’s the part that we think we can still blunt through the superb medical care that every client is receiving, but also even more stringent, people following the guidelines."
2020-03-31,38:09,Unnamed,"I can’t see the small characters, but are we seeing death until June? I can’t really-"
2020-03-31,38:16,Dr. Deborah Birx,This is June.
2020-03-31,38:17,Unnamed,"This is June, so we would still see problems and deaths in June."
2020-03-31,38:22,Dr. Deborah Birx,It’s a projection.
2020-03-31,38:23,Unnamed,"It’s a projection, of course."
2020-03-31,38:24,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So, I mean, just getting back to what I said about the stepwise thing, deaths always lag, so you will be seeing deaths at a time when as an epidemic we’re doing really, really well because the deaths will lag."
2020-03-31,38:38,Jim Acosta,"But Dr. Fauci, should Americans be prepared for the likelihood that there will be 100,000 Americans who die from this virus?"
2020-03-31,38:48,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The answer is yes, as sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it. Is it going to be that much? I hope not, and I think the more we push on the mitigation, the less likelihood it would be that number, but as being realistic, we need to prepare ourselves that that is a possibility that’s what we will see."
2020-03-31,39:09,Jim Acosta,That’s a very short period of time for that to happen.
2020-03-31,39:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Right.
2020-03-31,39:12,Jim Acosta,"Can the country handle that in such a short period of time within a couple of months, 50,000 a month?"
2020-03-31,39:19,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You know, it will be difficult. I mean no one is denying the fact that we are going through a very, very difficult time right now. I mean, we’re seeing what’s happening in New York. That is really, really tough, and if you extrapolate that to the nation, that will be really tough. But that’s what it is, Jim, and we’re going to have to be prepared for that."
2020-03-31,39:37,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think because the model, that model that was from IHME, that’s based in heavily ladened by the data that has come in from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut. So, you know, that can skew to a higher peak and more significant mortality. If all of the other states are able, and all the other metro areas are able to hold that case number down, then it’s a very different picture. But you have to predict on the data you have, which is heavily skewed to New York and New Jersey."
2020-03-31,40:16,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Getting back to that, that’s really an important slide that Dr. Birx showed. The cluster of other cities that are not New York and not New Jersey, if we can suppress that from any kind of a spike, the numbers could be significantly lower than what we’re talking about."
2020-03-31,40:32,Jim Acosta,[inaudible 00:40:32] cities that are not following these guidelines-
2020-03-31,40:34,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Right, and that’s the reason my plea at the end of my remarks, Jim, that now was the time to put your foot on the accelerator, because that’s the only thing that’s going to stop those peaks."
2020-03-31,40:49,Donald Trump,"But some of the cities are doing very well, as you see, very well at this early stage, but the number, the doctor said 100,000. All numbers between a 100,000 and 200,000 maybe even slightly more, but we would hope that we could keep it under."
2020-03-31,41:00,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Can we have the next slide or slide after that? Just go, yeah, one more slide. Perfect. Yeah."
2020-03-31,41:07,Jim Acosta,"Would you tell cities that aren’t doing what New York, New Jersey, Washington, the cities that have been taking charge in all of this, would you urge some of the cities that haven’t been doing this, Mr. President, to get with the program?"
2020-03-31,41:23,Donald Trump,"Well, I would, but you see, New York, I believe the blue is New York, New York is having a much harder time than other of the cities. Certain cities are doing… Actually, you look down here, an incredible job. They were early. They were very, very firm and they’ve done an incredible job. This is New Jersey, New York. This is…"
2020-03-31,41:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I mean, remember, California and Washington state, were down here and they had some of the earliest cases."
2020-03-31,41:48,Jim Acosta,"But we’re seeing places in Florida not doing what New York and New Jersey have been doing, what Washington state has been doing."
2020-03-31,41:56,Donald Trump,I think they’re doing very well with the [inaudible 00:41:56]. [crosstalk 00:41:58] Yes.
2020-03-31,42:00,Unnamed,"Could maybe direct the question to you and then to Dr. Fauci as well, we were told yesterday that your accomplishment of the U.S., at least is accomplishing 100,000 tests per day, but we’re still hearing difficult stories from the front lines, some of the first responders that you praised so appropriately a little while ago, that they can’t test all of the people that they need to test. Do you have any kind of projection as to when everyone who needs a test will be able to receive one?"
2020-03-31,42:27,Donald Trump,"I can only say that we’re doing more than anybody in the world by far. We are testing highly accurate tests. These are tests that work, as you know, many tests are being sent to countries that are broken."
2020-03-31,42:39,Unnamed,But it’s still not enough.
2020-03-31,42:39,Donald Trump,"Well, every day we get, and the word is exponential, we are getting more and more and more, and now we have the new tests that you saw yesterday. That’s going to be rolled out, I think, tomorrow or the next day, and that’s going to take only a few minutes, literally a few minutes to see the result and it’s a highly accurate result. I mean the tests were given out not by us, by other countries, where there was a 50/50 chance that it was wrong. What kind of a test is that? These are highly accurate tests, but the new tests that are coming out are very quick and they were just developed. Abbott Labs did the one yesterday. So we’re doing more than anybody in the world by far and they’re very accurate tests, and we’re getting a lot of information from those tests. [crosstalk 00:43:23]"
2020-03-31,43:26,Mike Pence,"The test President unveiled yesterday, the Abbott Laboratories test, which is a 15 minute test, our team is working very closely with [inaudible 00:43:37] and FEMA to make sure that those are distributed around the country. Earlier this week, Abbott Laboratories is actually going to be producing 50,000 tests a day and distributing those around America. There’s already the machines in some 18,000 different locations around the country, and they’ve told us they have several thousand on the shelf now, and what we’re doing is trying to identify the areas where we may yet have pockets, or as Dr. Birx often says, where we want to do more immediate testing so that we can do what’s called surveillance testing to identify where there may be coronavirus cases where there’s been very little incident."
2020-03-31,44:19,Mike Pence,"But if I could just amplify one other point, and that is that when you look at this chart, go back 15 days, and the reality is that, now this is me speaking as a lay person, but as I’ve listened to our experts, and New York and the greater New York City area have unique challenges. It’s a city that we really believe may have had exposure to the coronavirus much earlier on than we could have known and had its own challenges. New York, Connecticut, New Jersey are leaning into this effort. But when we look at this chart for all the other states, including Washington state and California, it really does give evidence, that at least it begins to give evidence that the 15 days to slow the spread is working, and that in fact the American people are putting these things into practice in states across the country, including in New York and New Jersey, even though they’ve faced a greater magnitude of cases for certain circumstances that are related to international travel in those communities. But I think-"
2020-03-31,45:24,Jim Acosta,Should there be a national shelter in place? [Crosstalk 00:45:26]
2020-03-31,45:26,Mike Pence,"No, I think the American people, what I’m suggesting, Jim, is the American people can look at these numbers in the other 48 states, and they can see that in the last 15 days, the President’s coronavirus guidelines were working, and that’s precisely why President Trump is asking every American to continue to put these guidelines into practice for 30 more days. [crosstalk 00:45:46]"
2020-03-31,45:51,Unnamed,"So right now we’re at about 4,000 deaths here in the United states, and you’re suggesting a spike of more than 90,000 deaths over the next few weeks? Do you have a demographic breakdown of the areas that are most at risk and where most of those deaths may occur?"
2020-03-31,46:08,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, right now, and I think if you ask Chris Murray, he would say he’s using the information coming out of New York and New Jersey, and applying that to potentially other states having the same outcomes. I just want to say again, this yellow line, and this is all corrected for a hundred thousand residents, so this is normalized so we can compare apples to apples. This is still Washington state, this yellow. So they’ve been able to, for a long time of measuring cases, not have a spike. So it’s possible, and we’re watching very closely to make sure it doesn’t have a spike, but that’s what the people in Washington state are doing. This is what every community, so Washington state early, about two weeks before New York or New Jersey, California, a week before New York or New Jersey, really talked to their communities and decided to mitigate before they started seeing this number of cases. And now we know that that makes a big difference. Early, as Dr. Fauci said, If you wait until you see it, it’s too late."
2020-03-31,47:23,Unnamed,"Again, do you have a demographic breakdown, Dr. Birx, of Where these deaths may occur?"
2020-03-31,47:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So there’s a demographic breakdown that we’ve discussed before related to mortality, and it’s as we’re seeing in New York exactly what we saw in Italy, very low mortality. Not to say that young people under 30 or young people under 40 aren’t getting ill, they are, but most of them are recovering. So the profile looks identical to Italy with increasing mortality with age and pre-existing medical conditions. And so that is holding in the same way. But what we’re hoping is that through the work of communities, and again it comes down to communities. This is communities deciding that this is important to them to not have the experience of New York and New Jersey, and I think, we are worried about groups all around the globe. I mean, I don’t know if you heard the report this morning, there’s 8,000 ventilators in the UK. If you translate that to the United states, that would be like the United states having less than 40,000 ventilators. We have five times that amount. So I mean, these are the things that everybody is having to face, and I think the United states is in an excellent position from our medical care position, but we don’t want to have to test that system. We want this to be a much smaller epidemic with much smaller mortality."
2020-03-31,48:54,Unnamed,"Can I just follow up on the testing question real quick before we move on. So, so the testing numbers, I understand a million tests done is a big increase, but we were told there would be a 27 million tests available by the end of the month. So can you outline where in the supply chain, where in the logistics chain, where are the other 26 million tests right now?"
2020-03-31,49:15,Mike Pence,"I think this is just for purposes of clarification, there’s a difference between sending a test that can be administered, to a test being done, and because a month ago or more, the President brought together the top commercial labs in America and said, “We need you to partner with us to create a brand new system that would rapidly process tests.” We’re now at 1.1 million tests and we believe it’s a fair estimate that we’re testing about a hundred thousand Americans a day. That’ll continue to grow. It will continue to accelerate, but I think the misunderstanding early on was there were many tests being distributed, many test kits being sent, but under the old system, as the President’s described it, the antiquated system, those were being processed in state labs, or at CDC, or in private labs on a very slow, methodical system that could only produce maybe 30 to 50 tests a day."
2020-03-31,50:24,Mike Pence,"But this new partnership that we have with commercial laboratories allows the progress we’re making. But the breakthrough with Abbott Laboratories now moves to point of care, which means you’re going to have devices and tests that people will literally be able to take at their doctor’s office, at a hospital, at a clinic, at a nursing home, and have the results in 15 minutes."
2020-03-31,50:46,Unnamed,So they’re the 26 million tests we were talking about. Were those tests under the old antiquated system?
2020-03-31,50:51,Mike Pence,Yes.
2020-03-31,50:52,Unnamed,So are we still even using those 27 million tests or have we just completely moved on to the point of care tests?
2020-03-31,50:58,Mike Pence,"The answer is yes, now through the new system."
2020-03-31,51:00,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So even today, which is I have to say, coming out of laboratories and develop tests, and worked on vaccines and then gone to the field to actually combat epidemics, it is disappointing to me right now that we have about 500,000 capacity of avid tests that are not being utilized. So they are out there in the states, they’re not being run and not utilized. So now we have to figure out how do we create awareness? Because sometimes when you put an early platform out, like our first platform out in the high speed was Roche, so you get that out, people get dependent on that and then don’t see that there’s availability of other tests. So right now there’s over a half a million tests sitting capacity that are not being utilized. So we’re trying to figure how do we inform states about where these all are? How do we work through every laboratory association so they’re aware? And how do we raise awareness so people know that there’s point of care, there’s Thermo Fisher, there’s Abbott testing, and there’s Roche."
2020-03-31,52:04,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And if you add those together, that’s millions of tests a week."
2020-03-31,52:09,Donald Trump,And they’re not being reported.
2020-03-31,52:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So those are the all [crosstalk 00:18:10], or they’re not even being used, so that’s what we’re working on."
2020-03-31,52:16,Unnamed,What’s the reason they’re being used?
2020-03-31,52:18,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Because when people get used to a single platform, they keep sending it back to that lab, so it’s getting an acute way to get on a Roche machine, rather being moved to this other lab that may have Abbott capacity, because they’re all in different laboratories. [inaudible 00:52:33] So I think, well actually, Admiral Giroir is figuring it out to really create some kind of visual, so that every governor and every health commissioner can see all of their capacity in their countries, I mean, in their states, county by county, so that they know where the tests are. So we pushed a lot of tests out, but they’re not all being utilized."
2020-03-31,52:55,Donald Trump,"And it’s up to the people if they don’t send them back. I mean, they use them. They don’t send a back. Doctor, go ahead, please."
2020-03-31,53:00,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, I mean, Dr. Birx explained it very, very well. I just want to get back, John, to your question. It’s a logical question. When you look at the number, you want to know what the demography is going to be. This is a number that we need to anticipate, but we don’t necessarily have to accept it as being inevitable. And that’s getting back to what I’m saying about we can influence this to a varying degrees, and if we influence it to the maximum, we don’t have to accept that. That’s something we need to anticipate. But I want to do, not I, all of us, want to do much, much better than that."
2020-03-31,53:34,Unnamed,"And on that front, what do the models suggest is on the low end if you have full mitigation?"
2020-03-31,53:40,Donald Trump,"Well, it says-"
2020-03-31,53:42,Dr. Deborah Birx,That was full mitigation.
2020-03-31,53:45,Donald Trump,"It says between 100 and 200,000."
2020-03-31,53:45,Dr. Anthony Fauci,That was full mitigation.
2020-03-31,53:46,Donald Trump,"It says 100 to 200,000, anything, it’s a lot of people. Right? It’s a lot of people. Well, you didn’t ask the other question. What would have happened, because this is the question that I’ve been asking Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx for a long time, and they’ve been working on this for a long time. The question is what would have happened if we did nothing? Because there was a group that said let’s just ride it out. Let’s ride it out. What would have happened? And that number comes in at 1.5 to 1.6 million people, up to 2.2 and even beyond. So that’s 2.2 million people would’ve died if we did nothing. We just carried on our life. Now I don’t think that would’ve been possible because you would have had people dying all over the place. This would not have been a normal life. How many people have even seen anybody die? You would have seen people dying on airplanes. You would’ve been seeing people dying in hotel lobbies. You would have seen death all over."
2020-03-31,54:40,Donald Trump,"So I think from a practical standpoint, that couldn’t have been carried out too far. But if you did nothing on the higher side, the number would be 2.2 and maybe even more, and on the lower side, 1.6 million people."
2020-03-31,54:57,Unnamed,"Understood. But if 100,000 is the number with full mitigation, how do you push it lower? [crosstalk 00:55:04]"
2020-03-31,55:04,Dr. Deborah Birx,"No, we’ll go together. We’ve been at this a long time. You go first."
2020-03-31,55:07,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So, John, it’s an obvious very good question. If this is full mitigation and it’s 100,000, why am I standing here saying I want to make it better? Because that’s what the model tells you it’s going to do. What we do is that every time we get more data, you feed it back in and re-look at the model. Is the model really telling you what’s actually going on? And again, I know my modeling colleagues are going to not be happy with me, but models are as good as the assumptions you put into them, and as we get more data, then you put it in and that might change. So even though it says according to the model, which is a good model that we’re dealing with, this is full mitigation. As we get more data, as the weeks go by, that could be modified."
2020-03-31,55:59,Unnamed,"Why does the model now, the top line on the low ball estimate, why does that not talk about it? I think it said 240,000 not 200,000. Is that a change? Is that because the states haven’t been doing enough?"
2020-03-31,56:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You know, it just has to do with, if you had more New Yorks and New Jersies, Chicago, Detroit, LA, Dallas, Houston, all of our major cities modeled like New York, that’s what gets us into trouble. But I am reassured by looking at the Seattle line, by looking at the LA line, by looking at what California has been able to do, that that is not something that I don’t believe that’s going to happen. That is the outside case of having 10, 15 metros like New York and the New Jersey metro area."
2020-03-31,56:55,Unnamed,"But New York had community spread pretty early undetected, so don’t many of those other states if not more of them, who had even less information, aren’t they likely to see the same spike?"
2020-03-31,57:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, California and Washington state reacted very early to this. Yes, Washington state had some of the earliest infections. They have kept it low and steady and for now a month has been tracking it with a small increase in the number of cases, but not this log rhythmic form of the virus, and so that’s the piece that we’re trying to prevent. That’s the piece that we’re trying to prevent in New Orleans, and Detroit, and Chicago, and in Boston right now, and trying to make sure that each of those cities work more like California than the New York metro area."
2020-03-31,57:47,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I just wanted to get your thoughts on face masks. We asked you about this yesterday and you signaled you were thinking about it."
2020-03-31,57:53,Donald Trump,"Just to end the last topic [inaudible 00:00:57:55], I think I can say this because I spoke to Dr. Birx before, and to Dr. Fauci, for whatever reason, New York got off to a very late start, and you see what happens when you get off to a late start. New Jersey got off, and I think both governors are doing an excellent job, but they got off to a very late start. When you look at Washington state, if you remember, that all started in a very confined nursing home, and you had 20 some odd people, I believe dying in one home. That doesn’t mean it escaped that home, and so they have a very different statistic than other states. But I mean, I remember it very vividly, the nursing home in Washington state, where you had many people dying every day, people were dying in the one exact location, so they were able to keep that relatively speaking into that location."
2020-03-31,58:56,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:58:56] Were you surprised when you saw these projections? Because the numbers are sobering.
2020-03-31,59:01,Donald Trump,"They are very sobering. Yeah, when you see 100,000 people and that’s at a minimum number. Now what we’re looking at, and as many people as we’re talking about, whatever we can do under that number and substantially under that number, we’ve done that through really great mitigation. We’ve done that through a lot of a very dedicated American people. That 100,000 is, according to modeling, a very low number. In fact, when I first saw the number, and I asked this a while ago, they said it’s unlikely you’ll be able to attain that. I think we’re doing better than that. Now I think, we have to see, but I think we’re doing better than that because as John said, that would be a lot of lives taking place over a relatively short period of time. But think of what would have happened if we didn’t do anything."
2020-03-31,59:48,Donald Trump,"I mean, I’ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually common sense, they said, “Why don’t we ride it out?” A lot of people have said. A lot of people that thought about it, ride it out, don’t do anything, just ride it out, and think of it as the flu. But it’s not the flu. It’s vicious. When you send a friend to the hospital and you call up to find out how is he doing, it happened to me, where he goes to the hospital and he says goodbye, he’s sort of a tough guy, a little older, a little heavier than he’d like to be frankly, and you call up the next day, how’s he doing, and he’s in a coma. This is not the flu. So we would have seen things had we done nothing. But for a long while, a lot of people were asking that question, I think, right?"
2020-03-31,01:00:35,Donald Trump,"I was asking it also. I mean, a lot of people were saying, “Well, let’s just ride it out. This is not to be ridden out, because then you would’ve been looking potentially 2.2 million people or more, 2.2 million people in a relatively short period of time. If you remember, they were looking at that concept, it’s a concept I guess, you know it’s concept if you don’t mind death, a lot of death, but they were looking at that in the UK, remember? They were very much looking at it and all of a sudden they went hard the other way, because they started seeing things that weren’t good. So they put themselves in a little bit of a problem. Now, Boris tested positive and I hope he’s going to be fine, but in the UK, they were looking at that, and they have a name for it, but we won’t even go by the name. But it would have been, it would have been very catastrophic, I think, if that would’ve happened."
2020-03-31,01:01:33,Donald Trump,"But that was something that everybody was talking about, Steve. Like, just don’t do anything, don’t do anything. Forget about everything. Just ride it out. They used the expression, ride it out. We would have had at a minimum 1.5, 1.6, but you would have had perhaps a more than 2.2 million people dying in a very short period of time. And that would have been a number that the likes of which we’ve never seen."
2020-03-31,01:01:58,Donald Trump,"So now when we look at our package that we just approved for $2 trillion, all of a sudden it seems very reasonable. Right? When you’re talking about 2 million lives, all of a sudden it seems very reasonable. I must say, a lot of people that have been seeing the more advanced numbers, because these are much more advanced numbers now. You know when you first started, we didn’t know, and this was a different kind of a virus, and nobody knew that much about it, even the experts, you don’t really know where it’s going. But then they see what goes on in Italy, and they see what goes on in Spain, and you see France is having a very hard time, and other countries having a very, very hard time. But once they see what’s going on, they start making projections. So I hope they’re going to be very high projections. But based on everything else, that would be the number. Let’s see if we can do much better than that. I hope we can. Yeah, John."
2020-03-31,01:02:50,Unnamed,What about masks? You didn’t answer about the masks. [Crosstalk 00:28:51].
2020-03-31,01:02:50,Unnamed,What’s your recommendation? I understand there’s an issue with supplies.
2020-03-31,01:02:56,Donald Trump,"That’s right. [crosstalk 01:02:57] Well, it’s this way. You know, you can use a scarf. A lot of people have scarfs and you can use a scarf. Scarf would be very good, and my feeling is if people want to do it, there’s certainly no harm to it. I would say do it, but use a scarf if you want, rather than going out and getting a mask or whatever. We’re making millions and millions of masks, but we want them to go to the hospitals. I mean, one of the things that Dr. Fauci told me today is we don’t want them competing. We don’t want everybody competing with the hospitals where you really need them. So you can use scarfs. You can use something else over your face. It doesn’t have to be a mask, but it’s not a bad idea, at least for a period of time. I mean, eventually you’re not going to want to do that. You’re not going to have to do that. This is going to be gone. It’ll be gone, hopefully gone for a long time. [crosstalk 01:03:49] Please."
2020-03-31,01:03:51,Unnamed,"Mr. President, the mitigation steps that are on your 30 day plan. Is that enough or is more needed? Have you been discussing that behind the scenes?"
2020-03-31,01:03:58,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to find out. We hope it’s enough. We hope it’s enough. We hope we’re at a level where we could say, “Let’s go because our country wants to get back to work.” We really want to get back. Everybody wants to get back to work. Now, I could ask the doctors to answer that question, but we discus that all the time. What do you think?"
2020-03-31,01:04:16,Unnamed,Have they been recommending harsher mitigation efforts?
2020-03-31,01:04:19,Donald Trump,"Well, I think we’ve been very harsh. I mean, you look at the streets. I looked at 5th Avenue today on camera, and I didn’t see anybody walking on the street, and I’m used to watching that street, you can’t see the asphalt, you can’t see the concrete, and you look and there’s nobody. There was one car. It looked like it might’ve been a taxi cab and it was in a time of the morning that there’d normally there’d be a lot of people. I mean, I think the mitigation has been very strong. Please."
2020-03-31,01:04:47,Unnamed,"Mr. President, will you confirm your plans to defer tariff payments for 90 days and secondly on interest?"
2020-03-31,01:04:54,Donald Trump,"I didn’t do anything about tariff payments. I don’t know who’s talking about tariff payments. They keep talking about tariff payments and we haven’t done that. China’s paying us. We made a deal with China. Under the deal, they’re paying us 25% on $250 billion and they pay it. And I spoke with President Jinping the other day and we didn’t mention that. We had a great conversation, by the way, a really productive conversation having to do with many things. Most of it was on the virus, but you know, we’re not talking… Who are you with? Who are you with?"
2020-03-31,01:05:25,Unnamed,If I could just clarify.
2020-03-31,01:05:27,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-03-31,01:05:27,Unnamed,Wall Street Journal.
2020-03-31,01:05:29,Donald Trump,Oh.
2020-03-31,01:05:29,Unnamed,There’s reporting by Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg that there’s a plan in motion-
2020-03-31,01:05:33,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I know, it’s an incorrect report. Well, that might be, but I’m going to have to approve the plan [crosstalk 01:05:37], but one thing I will tell you, I approve everything and they haven’t presented it to me, so therefore it’s false reporting, so therefore don’t do the story. If we’re going to do something, I’d be glad to let you know. There’s nothing wrong with doing it, but, we’ll let you know. Yeah, please. A couple of back, then we’ll get back to you, John."
2020-03-31,01:05:57,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. [inaudible 01:05:58] politics. I wanted to ask you about individual states issuing stay at home or what do you think, for instance, in Florida, Ron DeSantis has resisted urges to issue one of those, but he said moments ago that if you and the rest of the task force recommended one, that would weight on him heavily. What sort of circumstances need to be in place for you to make that call and say this is something you should consider?"
2020-03-31,01:06:25,Donald Trump,"Different kind of a state, also great Governor, knows exactly what he’s doing, has a very strong view on it, and we have spoken to Ron. Mike, you want to just to tell him a little bit about that."
2020-03-31,01:06:36,Mike Pence,"Well, let me echo our appreciation for Governor DeSantis’ leadership in Florida. He’s been taking decisive steps from early on and working closely with our team at the federal level. But let me be very clear on this. The recommendation of our health experts was to take the 15 days to slow the spread, and have the President extend that to 30 days for every American. Now, that being said, we recognize that when you’re dealing with a health crisis in the country, it is locally executed by healthcare workers, but it’s state managed. And so we continue to flow information to state governors. We continue to hear about the data that they’re analyzing and consult with them. But at the President’s direction, the White House Coronavirus Task Force will continue to take the posture that we will defer to state and local health authorities on any measures that they deem appropriate. But for the next 30 days, this is what we believe every American and every state should be doing at a minimum to slow the spread."
2020-03-31,01:07:49,Donald Trump,"So, unless we see something obviously wrong, we’re going to let these governors good. Now, it’s obviously wrong, I mean, people can make things, they can make a decision that we think is so far out that it’s wrong, we will stop that. But in the case of-"
2020-03-31,01:08:03,Donald Trump,"So far out that it’s wrong, we will stop that. But in the case of Governor DeSantis, there’s two thoughts to it, and two very good thoughts to it, and he’s been doing a great job in every respect, so we’ll see what happens. But we only would exercise if we thought somebody was very obviously [inaudible 01:08:16] Go ahead. Your turn."
2020-03-31,01:08:17,Unnamed,"Thanks. I had a question in a minute for the Vice President about the national strategic stockpile, but while you’re at the podium, I wanted to ask about your call with President Putin a couple of days ago. I know a big economic concern for a lot of people has been the state of oil prices right now, so I’m wondering if you raised that with President Putin, if you were able to [crosstalk 01:08:36]"
2020-03-31,01:08:35,Donald Trump,"We did. We had a call that was probably about that, the oil prices, because as you know, Russia and Saudi Arabia are going at it, and they’re really going at it, and by going at it to the extent that they are, the oil has dropped to a point where, look, it’s the greatest tax cut we’ve ever given. If you look at it that way, because people are going to be paying 99 cents for a gallon of gasoline. It’s incredible. In a lot of ways, it’s going to help the airlines, but at the same time, it’s hurtful to one of our biggest industries. That’s the oil industry. It’s really, it’s not even feasible what’s going on. So I spoke to President Putin about that. I also spoke to the Crown Prince about that, Saudi Arabia."
2020-03-31,01:09:24,Unnamed,And they agreed on [crosstalk 00:01:24].
2020-03-31,01:09:24,Donald Trump,"No, I think, yeah, they’re going to get together and we’re all going to get together, and we’re going to see what we can do. Because you don’t want to lose an industry. You’re going to lose an industry over it. 1000s and 1000s of jobs. I don’t know if you know. There’s oil all over the oceans right now. The boats are all filled. They’re renting ships. Ships that were dying, that weren’t doing well, and now that’s where they’re storing oil. And they’re sent out to sea, and they sit there for long periods of time. There’s so much oil. In some cases, it’s probably less valuable than water. In some parts of the world, water is much more valuable."
2020-03-31,01:09:59,Donald Trump,"So we’ve never seen anything like it. But the two countries are discussing it, and I am joining at the appropriate time, if need be. We had a great talk with President Putin. We had a great talk with the Crown Prince. We also discussed, more so with President Putin in this case, the virus, because Russia’s being hit pretty hard. And we discussed many things. Trade. We discussed a lot of things with both. But in the case of both, we very much discussed the oil and the oil prices. I mean, you look, it’s $22, but it’s really much cheaper than that if you want to negotiate. Nobody’s seen that. That’s like from the 1950s. It really is. To think that it was 50, 60, 70, 80, and now it’s 22. But you know, if you put a good bid in at nine, I think you could probably get what you wanted, right?"
2020-03-31,01:10:54,Donald Trump,"John, please."
2020-03-31,01:10:55,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, you tweeted earlier today that now would be a good time to start looking toward if there is a light at the end of the tunnel and work on an infrastructure bill. Again, you suggested it should be $2 trillion, which is twice what the last one was for the proposal released. Are you anticipating that like after the economic crisis of 2008, 2009, America will need to have so called shovel ready jobs ready to go to get people back to work?"
2020-03-31,01:11:22,Donald Trump,"Well, the problem with that one is they had maybe shovel ready jobs, maybe not, but they never used it for the purpose of infrastructure. So far, nobody has been able to find any money that was spent on infrastructure. I want to use it for infrastructure. And one of the reasons I’m suggesting it, John, is we’re paying zero interest. The United States is paying almost zero interest rate. The Federal Reserve lowered the rate, the fed rate. And that and a combination of the fact that everybody wants to be in the United States. You know, we have a dollar that’s very strong, and I know that sounds good, but it does make it hard to manufacture and sell outside, because other currencies are falling, and our currency is very strong. It’s very, very strong. Proportionately, it’s through the roof."
2020-03-31,01:12:05,Donald Trump,"So we have a strong dollar. People want to invest in the United States, especially nowadays where they’re looking at safety. They have all of the problems, plus the virus at 151 countries. They all want to come into the United States. And so we have a zero interest rate, essentially. And I said, “Wouldn’t this be a great time to borrow money at zero interest rate and really build our infrastructure like we can do it?” So the plan was, the Republicans had a plan of about 750. I would say… They were where? At seven five? The Democrats were a little less than a trillion dollars. The Republicans were a little bit less than that."
2020-03-31,01:12:40,Donald Trump,"And I’m suggesting $2 trillion. We redo our roads, our highways, our bridges. We fix up our tunnels, which are many of them in bad shape, like coming into New York, as you know, really bad shape. And we really do a job on our infrastructure, and that doesn’t mean we’re going to do the Green New Deal, because I won’t do it. I won’t approve it. We’re not going to do the Green New Deal and spend 40% of the money on things that people just have fun with."
2020-03-31,01:13:08,Steve (Reporter),"How would you pay for it, sir?"
2020-03-31,01:13:10,Donald Trump,"We’re going to borrow the money at zero percent interest, so our interest payments would be almost zero, and we can borrow long term. People want to be in the United States. They want to be invested in the United States. Go ahead, Jim."
2020-03-31,01:13:22,Jim (Reporter),I want to get back to the virus. You were saying at the beginning of the press conference that you’re looking at holding back 10000 ventilators. Is that because you need to pick and choose where these ventilators are going to have to go because of the nature of the pandemic [crosstalk 01:13:37]-
2020-03-31,01:13:36,Donald Trump,"Right, that’s a good question."
2020-03-31,01:13:37,Jim (Reporter),"-spreading, and also I just wanted to ask Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, if it’s possible after you finish, is that part of the reason why you’re projecting 100000 to 200000 deaths? Are there going to be some people who aren’t going to be able to get ventilators or be put on ventilators?"
2020-03-31,01:13:51,Donald Trump,"Actually, just the opposite, because we’re holding back. We have almost 10000. And we’re holding, because we’re going to need them over the next couple of weeks as the surge goes on. You see the chart. We haven’t hit the top yet. And we have to be able to move them immediately. And we can’t take them, because it’s going to be very hard to do that. We can’t take them to places that aren’t needing them. Plus we have requests for ventilators in hospitals and in states and cities that don’t need them, in our opinion. They don’t need them. They won’t need them [inaudible 01:14:22] for flexibility. We just took 600, and we sent them to different locations today, but we have close to 10000, and we’ll be able to get them. And we’re all set to march. We have the National Guards, and we have FEMA, and we’re all set to move them to the places."
2020-03-31,01:14:38,Donald Trump,"So as for your second question, what we’re going to do is save lives because of it, because otherwise, we would not be able to get to [inaudible 01:14:45] and we don’t know what the hottest spot-"
2020-03-31,01:14:47,Jim (Reporter),[crosstalk 01:14:47] ventilator shortage right now?
2020-03-31,01:14:49,Donald Trump,"In some areas we might, but we’ve done a great job with ventilators, and we’re having them made. Unbelievable, we have now 11 companies making ventilators. Now they’ll be starting to arrive in the next week, but we’ve also grabbed a lot of them. Some hospitals had more than they were saying, or at least more than we knew about, which is a good thing, not a bad thing. But we want to be able to have, I guess the word would be flexibility, so that if the surge turns out to be much stronger in Louisiana, which it could, that we can immediately bring 1000 or 2000 to Louisiana. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to get them. We wouldn’t be able to say, “Listen, Governor Cuomo in New York, we want to take ventilators away from New York.” And they’ll say, “Well, we can’t do that. It would be a disaster.” So we have great flexibility."
2020-03-31,01:15:38,Donald Trump,"Now when this surge occurs, if it occurs fairly evenly, we’ll be able to distribute them very quickly before they need them. But we have a reserve right now. It’s like having oil reserves, except more valuable, frankly. But we have a reserve right now. And we’ll be able, and we also have a great team of people ready to deliver. They can move them fast. So when we see it going up in a certain state, and Louisiana could be one, and Michigan could be another with Detroit, because Detroit is having a lot of hard times right now. Detroit came out of nowhere, and that’s what happens with this. It comes out of nowhere."
2020-03-31,01:16:15,Donald Trump,"So we are ready, Jim, depending on what happens. And we have a stockpile. And that’s why it’s called a stockpile. A lot of the ventilators and a lot of the other equipment, rather than sending it to the stockpile, we had it sent directly to a hospital, to a location, to a place, so we didn’t have the cumbersome nature of having it come in unboxed, put in and then deliver it. We have it brought, which they’d never done before. They don’t do that. Generally speaking, they don’t do that."
2020-03-31,01:16:42,Donald Trump,"But we’ve had, I think, Mike, we’ve had tremendous success of doing that. That’s for other items, including ventilators, where it’s brought to the site that needs it. But we have a good supply of ventilators, and we’re ready to go. We’re all ready. We have trucks ready. We have everything ready, because as we’re saying, John, this could be a hell of a bad two weeks. This is going to be a very bad two and maybe even three weeks. This is going to be three weeks like we haven’t seen before."
2020-03-31,01:17:09,John (Reporter),Should the hospitals be prepared for that? We’re hearing from some hospitals-
2020-03-31,01:17:12,Donald Trump,"Well, I think the hospitals-"
2020-03-31,01:17:13,John (Reporter),-that they’re facing what looks like a medical war zone in some of these places.
2020-03-31,01:17:16,Donald Trump,"Yeah. They are going to be facing a war zone. That’s what it is. I’ve heard some of the paramedics and some of the doctors. They said they’d been in war zones. They’ve never seen anything like this. You look at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens. I’ve never seen. I mean, I look, I just think it’s so, because that’s a hospital that’s near where I grew up. And it is a war zone in a true sense. Yeah, please?"
2020-03-31,01:17:39,Unnamed,"Yeah. On the ventilators, so we’ve been hearing from governors who say they are fighting amongst themselves, essentially bidding amongst themselves to get these ventilators."
2020-03-31,01:17:47,Donald Trump,"They shouldn’t be doing that. If that happens, they should be calling us. Look, we have ventilators, but we’ve distributed 1000s of ventilators. But they shouldn’t be doing that. And if they need them that badly, we know. We have pretty good ideas of where they’re going to need them. Some people, frankly, think they need them, and they don’t need them. I don’t want to mention names, but there are some people that want them, and it’s really not the right thing. Then you have some people that I guess automatically hoard a little bit. They want to have more than they think they need. But a ventilator is a very precious piece of equipment right now. It’s hard to make. It takes a long time to make it. It’s complex. Some of them are like the dashboard of an airplane. I mean, they’re very complicated and very expensive machines, and some are much simpler. But we’re ready to go depending on what happens."
2020-03-31,01:18:38,Donald Trump,"But we have some hospitals in some states that think they need ventilators, and we don’t think they do. Now if they do need them, we will have them there before they need them. We’ll be able to move very quickly."
2020-03-31,01:18:48,Unnamed,You’re confident that-
2020-03-31,01:18:48,John (Reporter),What about the Hydroxychloroquine? Is there any booming data on these trials?
2020-03-31,01:18:53,Donald Trump,"Nothing that I’ve heard. I mean, that’s the first question I make every morning. I tell you, I call up, you know we have 1100. 1100 in New York right now, and we have other locations where patients, people are taking them. Now the good news is it’s only three days, and it’s like a seven or eight day treatment. The good news is we haven’t heard anything bad. In other words, there have been no catastrophic events. But we haven’t. It’s a little bit too soon to talk about it. It would be a total game changer, John, if that happened. If that happened, it would be a game changer. And we include that in that, and I think in all cases the Z-Pak, you know what the Z-Pak is. So we’re going to see what happens with the Hydroxychloroquine. [crosstalk 01:19:44]"
2020-03-31,01:19:44,Donald Trump,Yeah. Just one second. Steve?
2020-03-31,01:19:45,Steve (Reporter),Are there other antiviral drugs that have some promise of working soon?
2020-03-31,01:19:49,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at a lot of them. We’re looking at a lot of them. Some show promise. I think maybe the doctor might want to speak about the vaccines, because a lot of Johnson & Johnson is advanced, very advanced. We’ll see what happens. The one thing with the vaccine is it doesn’t help this group, because this group, you need to test a vaccine. The one thing with the drug you just mentioned, right, is that it’s been out. It’s a malaria drug and also an arthritis drug. So it’s been out there for a long time. Very powerful drug. But it’s been out there for a long time. So it’s tested in the sense that you know it doesn’t kill you, but you may want to discuss the vaccines for a second, Dr. Fauci."
2020-03-31,01:20:30,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you Mr. President. But just for a second before the vaccine, in answer to your question, Steve. There are a number of candidates. The drugs that are now being looked at in various ways, either compassionate use, clinical trials, are generally drugs that already exist for other things. There’s a whole menu of drugs and interventions that are now going into clinical trials that are not approved for anything yet. I mean, for example, things like immune serum, convalescent plasma or hyper immune globulin or monoclonal antibodies, a variety of other things. Right now there’s a lot of activity going on behind the scenes in the design of the kinds of clinical trials that will give us an answer, because you need an answer, because if it doesn’t work, you want to get it off the table and go to the next one. So there are a lot of things."
2020-03-31,01:21:18,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Vaccine-
2020-03-31,01:21:18,Steve (Reporter),How long does that normally take? Weeks? Months?
2020-03-31,01:21:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, it takes at least months. At least months. At least. I mean, that’s the reason why you’re seeing a lot of activity with drugs that already exist for other purposes, because they’re already there. But the drugs that you want to show in a good randomized clinical trial, at very best, they’re going to take months. Just one word on the vaccine, exactly like we said, we hope that as we get into the summer, if in fact there are cases out there, when you’re in a phase two or phase three trial, or two, 2B, as we call it, that we might get an early efficacy signal. And an efficacy signal means that even though you haven’t definitively proven that a vaccine works, you get enough inflammation that if it were an emergency, you might be able to have an emergency youth authorization for it. [crosstalk 01:22:10]"
2020-03-31,01:22:09,Donald Trump,"And I have to sit in this. Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin, which is, you take it with it, maybe, if you want, for the infection. I think some medical workers are doing that. Using it, maybe, or getting it prescribed perhaps for another use. But the word is that some are, and some aren’t. I mean, I think it’s not a bad idea to do it, but that’s up to the doctors. But there is a theory going around that in our country and some other countries, people are taking, that work in the hospitals, that work with the patients, because there is some evidence, and again, it’s going to have to be proven. It’s very early. We’re rushing this stuff through. This was supposed to take a long time to be approved, and I prevailed upon the FDA to get it approved immediately on the basis that it was already in the market for a lot of years for another use, malaria mostly. And arthritis, but mostly malaria."
2020-03-31,01:23:08,Donald Trump,"So we’ll see what happens. But there is a theory out there that for the medical worker, Doctor, it may work. It may work. And if you take it, it’s been out there for a long time. Please, go ahead."
2020-03-31,01:23:19,Unnamed,I just wanted to go back to Jim’s question about the national stockpile. The governor of [crosstalk 01:23:24].
2020-03-31,01:23:24,Donald Trump,About which?
2020-03-31,01:23:27,Unnamed,The national strategic stockpile. Governor of Connecticut today said that he was disturbed to learn that the stockpile was now empty. That’s his words. And he said-
2020-03-31,01:23:36,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s not empty. Let me explain something. What we’re doing, I thought I said it accurately. I certainly meant to. Rather than having it brought into the stockpile, where appropriate, other than certain things, like we have quite a few of the ventilators, which is not a lot when you look at the whole country, actually. It sounds like a lot, almost 10000, but we’re trying to have supply sent directly to the states, because we save a big state. We don’t want medical supplies coming in to warehouses all over the place, and then we take them from there and bring them to another warehouse. So we’re having it brought ideally from the manufacturer directly to the hospital or the state where it’s going."
2020-03-31,01:24:19,Donald Trump,"So we’re trying to keep it that way as much as possible. Now in some cases we are having it brought. Remember this. We also took over a virtually empty, and I say it again, just like we had no ammunition in the military, and we had virtually no ammunition. Well, we had very little in medical supplies, too, in our stockpile. So for the most part, we’re trying very hard to have it delivered to the site where they need it. Yeah. Please go ahead."
2020-03-31,01:24:45,Unnamed,"Mr. President, here in the United States domestically, we can practice social distancing. But some of our sailors, specifically on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, they’re not able to. They’re in confined spaces. What are your thoughts on that? Should they be offloaded? And then, sir, are you concerned-"
2020-03-31,01:25:02,Donald Trump,I’m going to let the military make that decision.
2020-03-31,01:25:04,Unnamed,"Are you concerned about US military readiness during this pandemic? For instance, what would happen if, as reported, China was to increase patrols in the South China Sea? What would your response be?"
2020-03-31,01:25:15,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to see all about that. Don’t worry about our military. You saw the military put up a hospital in three and a half days with 2900 beds, with a lot of beds. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. And by the way, that wasn’t the only one. It wasn’t just the Javits Center. It was at other locations. And now it’s Louisiana, and now it’s New Jersey, and now it’s other places. One thing that I think is indisputable is when I watched the Army Corps of Engineers, and FEMA working with them, but when I watched the Army Corps of Engineers throw up these hospitals, and they’re complex. I mean, these are incredible buildings, essentially. Tents and various things, but they did it in such a quick, such a short period of time."
2020-03-31,01:26:01,Donald Trump,"And our military is ready like you haven’t seen, and you know who are the best? The best guests are the different shows are, we watch the shows at night. And I think the best guests that I’ve seen in a long time are the military people. And they’ve never done it before. I’ve watched General Semonite, who I deal with a lot. I say, “General, you got to give us two new hospitals in Louisiana.” “Yes sir.” And the next morning, they’re building them at 6:00 in the morning, and they’re up in three days. I think they’re the best. The best guest you have. I guess I’m tired of the other guests, in all fairness."
2020-03-31,01:26:33,Unnamed,What kind of message do you have [crosstalk 00:18:35].
2020-03-31,01:26:34,Donald Trump,"Jim, go ahead."
2020-03-31,01:26:35,Jim (Reporter),"Yes, sir. This may be an uncomfortable question, but what would the models have looked like that Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci showed us if we had started the social distancing guidelines sooner than February or January when China, South Korea were doing those sorts of [crosstalk 01:26:52]."
2020-03-31,01:26:51,Donald Trump,"Well, I’m going to let them answer that. Yeah?"
2020-03-31,01:26:54,Jim (Reporter),"[crosstalk 01:26:54] reliable, in terms of what information we’re getting from them, but if we had started these practices sooner, could these models be different right now?"
2020-03-31,01:26:59,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I’m going to let them answer the question, but remember this. And again, I say it and everybody says it. You know who says it better than anybody is Dr. Fauci. I had a decision to make. Maybe it was my biggest decision. China was heavily infected, and 1000s and 1000s of people were coming from China to the United States. And against the wishes, not even wishes, but they disagreed with the decision. I made a decision to stop China from coming in. Took a lot of heat, even from China. They weren’t exactly happy. I just made a trade deal, a big one, $250 billion trade deal. And I’m shortly thereafter saying, “You can’t come into our country.”"
2020-03-31,01:27:38,Donald Trump,"That was a big decision. That was earlier than the date you’re talking about. So that was a big decision. That was probably, and by the way, not because I did it, that was probably the biggest decision we made so far. But if you look at the one graph, the problem New York has is New York started late, but the other ones didn’t start so late. Now New York is also more complicated, because for obvious reasons, but it got a late start. But do you maybe want to answer those questions?"
2020-03-31,01:28:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I don’t know if you can go back to slide two, because I wanted to explain two things that I think is really important, because we had a lot of questions about mortality and what it meant. Okay. So you see this confidence interval? So here’s the line. This is the confidence interval. This is where we have the ability to push it down. So you have a large confidence interval around the line. And so we’re trying to move that gray down tighter and below the dotted line. So I think that’s really important."
2020-03-31,01:28:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And then if you can go to the next slide. So we really can’t answer your question until we can get antibody testing out there. Because what we can’t tell you, and we can always do this, there’s always samples in hospitals and other things. It’s the way we really define the HIV epidemic in the United States. We were able to go back to blood samples when we had the test and really find out where it was and what was going on. We really need to look in here. And really see was there virus significantly circulating in early March and late February? And what did it look like? And where was it? And was it all in the metro areas? And I think that’s what Dr. Fauci and I are very, very focused on is getting serology testing out there to really figure out when it came, and really have those samples to be able to do that."
2020-03-31,01:29:43,Jim (Reporter),"You understand the painful part of my question, and please, I don’t mean to put you on the spot-"
2020-03-31,01:29:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"No, we understand, but we can’t answer it until we see that."
2020-03-31,01:29:50,Jim (Reporter),"-but there may be Americans at home saying, “If we had started this sooner, we might not have 100000 to 200000 Americans dying.”"
2020-03-31,01:29:56,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, that makes an assumption that it was here, a lot back here, that we didn’t see. And until we have the antibody tests, I can’t really answer that."
2020-03-31,01:30:07,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Just to underscore what Dr. Birx was saying, if there was no virus in the background, there was nothing to mitigate. If there was virus there that we didn’t know about, then the answer to your question is probably yes. Now the only trouble with that is that whenever you come out and say something like that, it always becomes almost a sound bite that gets taken out of context, but I think that’s very important, what Dr. Birxs has said, is that if there was covert infections here that we didn’t know about, and we didn’t mitigate them, that they would’ve made a difference. If there was virtually nothing there, then there’s nothing to mitigate. And I don’t know the answer to your question."
2020-03-31,01:30:47,Jim (Reporter),"But they were early. They started early. We were watching South Korea, excuse me, and China and Italy, and we weren’t taking action when those countries were spiking."
2020-03-31,01:30:55,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"In a perfect world, it would have been nice to know what was going on there. We didn’t, but I believe Jim, that we, we acted very, very early in that."
2020-03-31,01:31:04,Jim (Reporter),"If we had adequate testing, would we have known?"
2020-03-31,01:31:06,Dr. Anthony Fauci,I’m not-
2020-03-31,01:31:09,Donald Trump,We would have known the same thing. We inherited [inaudible 01:31:11].
2020-03-31,01:31:13,Mike Pence,"Can I speak to that too as well? President made reference to the fact, January 31, he suspended all travel from China. Shortly thereafter, we issued strong travel advisories for the sections of Italy implicated and sections of South Korea, and we reached agreements with those countries to screen all passengers from all airports coming into the United States of America. The president’s initial efforts were designed at preventing the Coronavirus from coming into the United States. And what our experts have told us again and again at the Coronavirus task force is that those actions bought us a significant amount of time on this curve to respond with kind of mitigation efforts, standing up resources, testing and supplies that are in effect."
2020-03-31,01:32:04,Mike Pence,"But we went from a prevention strategy the President acted on before the month of January was over to a mitigation strategy, which continues to this day. And if I can also say just just to every American, all the questions about resources are very important. And I can assure you that the President and our task force are preoccupied with these issues and working with governors hour by hour to meet those needs. But if Americans will put into practice these guidelines for another 30 days, they’ll do their part to lower the curve and save lives, most importantly, and limit the burden on our hospitals and our healthcare system in the country significantly."
2020-03-31,01:32:56,Mike Pence,"And so make no mistake about it. While we’re going to work our hearts out, leave no stone unturned, to find the resources, the masks, the ventilators that we need, and we are going to meet that moment with the full energy of the American economy and the whole of the American government. The American people have a role to play in preserving that medical capacity in a way that will ensure that people that are caught up in the Coronavirus, particularly those that are vulnerable to the most serious outcomes, which are seniors with serious underlying health conditions or anyone with an immunodeficiency, have the resources, the support and the health care that every American family would want their loved one to have. [crosstalk 01:33:37]"
2020-03-31,01:33:37,Donald Trump,"I do believe we were very early, but I also think that we were very smart, because we stopped China. We had never done that before. You know, we had never closed our borders before, as I read. I read. I don’t know, maybe that’s not right. And Dr. Fauci had also said that was, I think it was maybe the biggest moment, because we were stopping the source. We were stopping the infection. But we also stopped Europe very shortly thereafter. That was a big decision. That was not an easy decision either. I stopped them a long time before people started stopping anywhere. So we stopped China, we stopped Europe, we stopped all of Europe. And then ultimately we stopped UK, Ireland. Yes? [crosstalk 01:34:23] In the back there, please."
2020-03-31,01:34:28,Unnamed,"Mr. President, [inaudible 01:34:28] going back to Hydroxychloroquine, how many clinical trial tests in America would you like to see before you put a stamp of approval on it? Because there are clinical trials taking place around the world right now."
2020-03-31,01:34:41,Donald Trump,"Sure, please."
2020-03-31,01:34:42,Unnamed,Is there a number? How many cases would you like to see?
2020-03-31,01:34:45,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That is an FDA decision, and it really depends on a variety of factors, but I would like to see a clinical trial that has a comparison to something that is comparable to what it means without the drug. I mean, I keep saying it. I say it all the time, and I’ll say it again. It’s a control trial that compares it to something meaningful. When that occurs-"

2020-03-31,01:35:08,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, there are a number of trials going on, not only in the United States but also in other parts of the world. And right now, it’s too early to make any determination, but I just want to get back to what I say all the time. The definitive way that you get an answer is by doing a randomized controlled clinical trial. [crosstalk 00:27:27]."
2020-03-31,01:35:26,Unnamed,Mr. President. Mr. President.
2020-03-31,01:35:27,Donald Trump,"Yeah please, go ahead. You’re talking about the chloroquine? Is that what you’re talking about? In specifically the last question?"

2020-03-31,01:35:56,Unnamed,"Mitch McConnell, yeah. He said that impeachment diverted the attention of the government. Do you think that in any way, this was happening in Italy at the same time. Did it divert your attention or your team’s attention or the Vice President’s attention?"
2020-03-31,01:36:07,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t like to think I did. I think I handled it very well, but I guess it probably did. I mean, I got impeached. I think I certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it. Right? But think of it. It was a hoax. It was a total hoax. And when you think that I got impeached only because they had a majority in the House. They didn’t get one Republican vote. 196 to nothing. Not one Republican. I don’t think it’s ever happened. The Republicans stuck together, and they stuck together in the Senate. 52 to a half. A half. So when you say that, yeah, I think it took a lot of, I see them going and saying about speed. Well, they probably illegally impeached me in the sense that if you look at the FBI today with what happened, the horrible things, nobody cares about that now, because all they’re thinking about is the virus. And that’s okay with me."
2020-03-31,01:37:01,Donald Trump,"But you look at the report that came out from IG Horowitz, it’s disgraceful what went on. It’s disgraceful. It’s a total disgrace. They got caught in the act, but you know what? We won’t talk about that now. Did it divert my attention? I think I’m getting A pluses for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment. Okay? It was a hoax. But certainly, I guess I thought of it. And I think I probably acted. I don’t think I would have done any better had I not been impeached. Okay? And I think that’s a great tribute to something. Maybe it’s a tribute to me. But I don’t think I would have acted any differently, or I don’t think I would have acted any faster."
2020-03-31,01:37:46,Donald Trump,"But the Democrats, their whole life, their whole being, their whole existence was to try and get me out of office any way they can. Even if it was a phony deal. And it was a phony deal. And it turned out, and all you have to do is look today at the FBI reports. Take a look at what the FBI did. Take a look at the people. Take a look at Comey’s report. Seven and eight pages of total kill. Take a look at that. Take a look at the reporter, McCabe. Just read it. And you’ll see how horrible it was. And you know what? I don’t think this country is going to take it. You want to know the truth. [crosstalk 01:38:26]"
2020-03-31,01:38:27,Jim (Reporter),What guidance are you offering to Florida when it comes to the two Holland American cruise ships that are seeking to dock here?
2020-03-31,01:38:36,Donald Trump,"Yeah, well, I’ll be speaking. I’m going to be speaking. In fact, he has a call in to me. We’ll be speaking to the governor, and we’ll be speaking to him soon. But there’s a case. We have two ships. There are people that are sick on the ship, and we don’t want to be like they’re going to be ghost ships. You know, people turn those ships away. There was a ship, as you know, in a certain part of Asia and from port to port, nobody would take it. But in the meantime, you have people that are dying on the ship or at least very sick, but they’re dying on the ship. So I’m going to do what’s right, not only for us but for humanity. I mean, these are two big ships, and they have a lot of very sick people. I’ll be speaking to the governor. Let’s do just a couple more back here. [crosstalk 01:39:25] Go ahead, please."
2020-03-31,01:39:25,Unnamed,Mr. President. Thank you very much. I was hoping you could-
2020-03-31,01:39:31,Donald Trump,"Do you ever run out of questions, you people? It’s the most unbelievable thing. You go through the room with me. But I have nothing else to do. So if you want us. I mean, if you want. Should we keep it going, John? I think so. Let’s go."
2020-03-31,01:39:43,Unnamed,"Could you clarify something for me, please? Andrew Cuomo today said that the system that you have where governors are trying to get ventilators, it’s like being on eBay with 50 other states bidding on a ventilator, plus FEMA. And then you just said tonight they shouldn’t be doing that."
2020-03-31,01:39:56,Donald Trump,You mean he was complaining? Say it. What did he say exactly? What did he say?
2020-03-31,01:40:01,Unnamed,"He said that when you have states competing for ventilators and medical care, it’s like getting on eBay with 50 other states bidding on a ventilator, plus FEMA."
2020-03-31,01:40:09,Donald Trump,"Well, he shouldn’t be complaining because we gave him a lot of ventilators. And if you take a look at the chart, it’s down. But I wish he got going a little bit sooner. But we gave him a lot of ventilators, and you know what? He has a lot of ventilators. The problem is with some people, no matter what you give, it’s never enough. It’s never enough. Like they’ll say, ” How’s Trump doing?” And you’re a Democrat. Some of them said, “Really good.” I’ll tell you, Gavin Newsom from California, who’s doing a good job by the way, and others said, “Really good.” But generally your natural reflex. “How’s Trump doing?” You ask that question to a Democrat. “Well, we don’t like it.” Oh really? You don’t like it? We’re getting very high marks, but I’m not doing this for marks. I’m doing this to save lives. When John acted, wait. When John saw the numbers and when Jim saw those numbers, they’re shocking numbers. You know, you’re talking about deaths."
2020-03-31,01:41:04,Donald Trump,"Even at the low end, you were shocked. When you see 100 and 120000 and 200000 people over potentially a very short period of time, I want to save lives. I’m not doing this for any other reason. I want to save lives. But the governor of New York’s gotten, I think maybe, probably, has more than anybody has gotten. Four hospitals. He’s gotten four medical tents. He’s gotten a ship the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before other, than Los Angeles, which has the twin. I mean, we’ve done a lot, but many ventilators were sent to New York."
2020-03-31,01:41:40,Donald Trump,"And Mayor de Blasio. I’m getting along with Mayor de Blasio great. And I think he’s very happy with the job we’re doing, too. We’re sending a lot of, actually Mayor de Blasio had an interesting request. He wanted people. And we’re sending medical people. A lot of people, a lot of the states, aren’t having a problem with ventilators. They’re having a problem getting medical people, and we’re sending a lot of people in. Military-"

2020-03-31,01:42:10,Unnamed,"Your response to that question earlier was that they shouldn’t be doing that. If they need something … If they need them, that bad-"
2020-03-31,01:42:18,Donald Trump,They shouldn’t be doing what?
2020-03-31,01:42:20,Unnamed,The governors shouldn’t be competing with each other-
2020-03-31,01:42:22,Donald Trump,"They shouldn’t be competing and they should call us. Wait, no, I don’t want them to compete because all they’re going to do is drive up the price. I don’t want them to compete. They should be calling us and we can work it so they get the ventilators and they get shipped directly. If they’re competing, if they’re calling, even if there’s only two of them calling, they’re going to just drive up the price. Because as nice as some of the people that do ventilators, they do want to make money. Okay? Now, you don’t get a chance to buy 16,000 ventilators, I guess they didn’t take that option. That was in 2016, and that’s a hard option to take because it’s a lot of money and who would ever think you need 16,000 ventilators? Who would ever think it? But this a very unique time in life. And I think I’m dealing with New York and we’re having a very good relationship and you see what just happened in Central Park with the tents. I mean, we’re having a really good relationship. Go ahead. You didn’t get."
2020-03-31,01:43:11,Unnamed,Thank you. You mentioned Gavin Newson and the job that he’s doing.
2020-03-31,01:43:16,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-31,01:43:17,Unnamed,I’m interested in what you think California has done is to contribute to the suppression of the-
2020-03-31,01:43:22,Donald Trump,"They’ve done a good job, California. Now let’s see what happens. Because we could have a spike doctors. I mean, you don’t know. They could have a spike where all of a sudden it spikes upward. We had a couple of like a Louisiana, I think they’re doing a really good job, but they had nothing. Now they had Mardi Gras and then all of a sudden after Mardi Gras, which tells you about distancing, I guess. I mean, it’s an example of what could happen, but they were like flawless. I was always surprised. I was looking at Louisiana and I understand that state. I love that state, and I’m saying they’re in great shape. Then they have Monte Gras was a big success, tremendous success, and then all of a sudden it went like a rocket ship. So that tells you about distancing. Please."
2020-03-31,01:44:01,Unnamed,Are you concerned though about the homeless population in California? Because I know California officials think that it’ll spread like wildfire. Obviously-
2020-03-31,01:44:08,Donald Trump,"Say it again, a little louder."
2020-03-31,01:44:10,Unnamed,There’s a homelessness crisis in California.
2020-03-31,01:44:12,Donald Trump,"Yeah, there is."
2020-03-31,01:44:12,Unnamed,They’re obviously concerned that it could spread like wildfire in that community. Is there anything the administration-
2020-03-31,01:44:17,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re looking at that very strongly and I know that it’s bothers Gavin. I don’t know if it bothers Nancy Pelosi, but she’s got it in her district at a very high level. They have to be very careful. They have a very big homeless population in an area which just a few years ago didn’t have anybody in those areas, and they’re living in the streets and they’re … I know that some people in California are working on that very hard."
2020-03-31,01:44:41,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you’ve spoke several times with Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron, and at the end of the last week President Macron talked about an important initiative that you and him would launch. Any news on that?"
2020-03-31,01:44:53,Donald Trump,"We’re talking about something that will be very positive for the world if we do it, we’ll see if we do it or not. Well, I don’t want to talk … It’s a private thing, but it will become public if we decide to do it, but positive. Our relationship with the president, our relationship with France is I think extraordinary. Very good. Probably as good as it’s ever been."
2020-03-31,01:45:14,Jim (Reporter),"Going back to your comments about what could have happened and the actions that you took, is there any fairness to the criticism that you may have lulled Americans into a false sense of security when you were saying things like, “It’s going to go away.”"
2020-03-31,01:45:28,Donald Trump,"Well, it is."
2020-03-31,01:45:28,Jim (Reporter),And that sort of thing.
2020-03-31,01:45:30,Donald Trump,It’s going to go away. Hopefully at the end of the month and if not it hopefully will be soon after that.
2020-03-31,01:45:35,Jim (Reporter),But hasn’t your thinking on this evolved?
2020-03-31,01:45:39,Donald Trump,It is going away.
2020-03-31,01:45:39,Jim (Reporter),Hasn’t your thinking on this evolved? You’re taking it more seriously?
2020-03-31,01:45:43,Donald Trump,"I think from the beginning, my attitude was that we have to give this country … I knew how bad it was. All you have to do is look at what was going on in China. It was devastation. Well, yeah, look at the numbers from China, those initial numbers coming out from China. But I read an article today which was very interesting. They say, “We wish president Trump would give more bad news.” Give bad news. I’m not about bad news. I want to give people hope. I want to give people a feeling that we all have a chance. I mean, when you saw the numbers and when John and all of you saw those numbers and you were saying 120,000 people, you mean that’s good? 100,000 dead people within a short period of time. I want to give people a feeling of hope. I could be very negative. I could say, “Wait a minute. Those numbers are terrible. This is going to be horrible.” This is a horrible thing. Hey Jim-"

2020-03-31,01:46:49,Donald Trump,"Well, there were a lot of people that could have said that, we didn’t say that. Fortunately I didn’t say that and that was an alternative. We talked about it. That was always an alternative. That’s what I said, “Let it rip, let it ride, do nothing.” And we could have had 2.2 million dead people more than that because I didn’t do that. And we did catch it early and we stopped China really early and we stopped Europe really early because I saw what was happening … What happened is I stopped Italy because Italy was really heavily infected. We started off with certain parts of Italy, then all of Italy. Then we stopped Spain, then I said stop Europe, let’s stop Europe. We have to stop them from coming here. Europe, I love Europe, but they were having problems. I don’t think anybody did a better job than that. Especially when you see the 2.2 million number, and I hope we’re going to be substantially under the numbers that you’re looking at on the minimum side. Then I think we will have, hey look, it’s still tremendous death-"
2020-03-31,01:47:48,Jim (Reporter),"You weren’t just hoping that it would dissipate, that this would disappear?"
2020-03-31,01:47:52,Donald Trump,"I want to be positive. I don’t want to be negative. I have to … I’m a positive person. Somebody said, “Oh, I wish you’d be more negative.” They literally have that. It’s in one of the wonderful newspapers today. I wish you’d be more negative. Well, this is really easy to be negative about, but I want to give people hope too. I’m a cheerleader for the country. We’re going through the worst thing that the country’s probably ever seen. Look, we had The Civil War, we lost 600,000 people. Right? Here’s the thing, had we not done anything, we would have lost many times that, but we did something and so it’s going to be hopefully way under that, but we lose more here potentially than you lose in world wars as a country. So there’s nothing positive, there’s nothing great about it, but I want to give people in this country hope. I think it’s very important."
2020-03-31,01:48:44,Jim (Reporter),Did you know it was going to be this severe when you were saying this was under control and-
2020-03-31,01:48:47,Donald Trump,"I knew everything. I knew it could be horrible and I knew it could be maybe good. Don’t forget, at that time people didn’t know that much about it. Even the experts, we were talking about it. We didn’t know where it was going. We saw China, but that was it. Maybe it would have stopped at China. We wished we could have killed it in China, but it didn’t happen. It started spreading to Europe. It started spreading here. It started spreading all over, but … And I’m not blaming anybody, I’m just saying that we have an incredible thing. I think the people, our professionals, our military, our governors, our politicians, I think they’ve done an incredible job. With few exceptions, I think they’ve done an incredible job."
2020-03-31,01:49:27,Donald Trump,"But I don’t want to be a negative person. It’d be so much easier for me to come up and say, “We have bad news. We’re going to lose 220,000 people and it’s going to happen over the next few weeks.” And with that, I did start off by saying today, long before this question, I said, “This is going to be a rough two or three weeks.” This is going to be one of the roughest two or three weeks we’ve ever had in our country. We’re going to lose thousands of people."
2020-03-31,01:49:50,Donald Trump,"When I see 28, 29 people from the governor of New Jersey, 29 people, when you see 173 people died in New York yesterday or whatever the number was, I think it was more than that. When you see the kind of numbers that we’re witnessing, we’ve never seen numbers like that. So it’s easy to be negative and then everybody could be negative. But I’m a cheerleader for our country, and I want to do a great job so the number can be kept … And I’ve always said it. I want as few a number of people to die as possible and that’s all we’re working on."

2020-03-31,01:50:31,Donald Trump,"I don’t mind the question. I think it’s actually … I think it’s … It’s not meant to be. Look, I know you well enough, so it’s not meant to be a fair question, but it is a fair question. I think we’ve done a fantastic job. Okay, fine. I’ll, I’ll accept your word. Look, Jim. I think we’ve done a great job. We’re going to see how it comes out, but when you look at minimal numbers of 120,000 people, when you look at, it could have been 2.2 Million people died and more if we did nothing."
2020-03-31,01:50:58,Donald Trump,"If we just did nothing, would’ve gone up and would it come down as per your statement, it would have been confined. It would have been a similar time, maybe even less time. It would have been violence like we’ve never seen in this country before. We had great professionals, great military, really great governors and politicians. I cannot say enough about what’s going on. And as per what you said, I think we’re way ahead of schedule in terms of numbers, I think, I hope. But if we can keep it under the minimum numbers, the country has … Not me, the country has done a great job, but I think I’ve done a really good job of mobilizing. I think Mike Pence has been fantastic. I put him in charge of the task force. We have wonderful people on the task force, Jim, wonderful people. This man was working, literally, he had days where he didn’t go to bed, he didn’t go to sleep. He called … He went 24 hours and then started the next day."
2020-03-31,01:51:55,Donald Trump,"People don’t know the job he did. I didn’t even know he was that good of a manager to be honest with you, Mike. Okay? And you never know that about somebody until they’re tested under fire. But he saw it very early also. We both did. They saw it very early. They knew pretty soon. They probably knew sooner than anybody because that’s what they study. That’s what they do. Must be a depressing business, right? Let’s do a little bit depressing, but they’ve seen it all. Go ahead John."
2020-03-31,01:52:21,John (Reporter),"Can I ask Dr. Fauci a question about a headline that’s been running all day to get his perspective on it? There is a professor from MIT, Dr. Fauci, who suggests that coronavirus can be carried on droplets a distance of 27 feet. Do you buy into that and if that might be the case, does that suggest the current social distancing guidelines may need to be extended?"
2020-03-31,01:52:41,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"This could really be terribly misleading, John. What it was was looking at the distance that droplets by speaking, by coughing or sneezing. So if you go way back and go, “Achoo.” And go like that, you might get 27 feet. So when you see somebody do that get out of the way. But that’s not not-"
2020-03-31,01:53:02,John (Reporter),I know people that do that.
2020-03-31,01:53:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That is not practical, John. I’m sorry, but I was disturbed by that report because that’s misleading. That means that all of a sudden the six foot thing doesn’t work. That is a very, very robust vigorous achoo sneeze. That’s what that is. And that’s not what we’re talking about."
2020-03-31,01:53:23,Donald Trump,"Do you want to keep going? Go ahead, over there."
2020-03-31,01:53:28,Unnamed,"I’ve got a follow up on the mask, sir. But first you mentioned Franklin Graham, talking to him."
2020-03-31,01:53:33,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-03-31,01:53:33,Unnamed,"As you know, his father, Billy Graham, was a trusted spiritual advisor and friend of many presidents, a lot of your predecessors in times of national emergency reached out to pastors and other spiritual counselors. Have you done that during this national-"
2020-03-31,01:53:46,Donald Trump,"I never say that, but Franklin Graham is somebody that’s very special. I have many very special people and a very many special in the evangelical, evangelical Christian community. You could talk rabbis, you can talk a lot of … I have tremendous support from religious leaders and Franklin Graham, I just spoke to him today for an extended period of time. I told him what a fantastic job you’re doing, and he does this. He loves doing it. He loves helping people, and he loves Jesus. Then I can tell you. He loves Jesus. He’s a great gentleman. Go ahead."
2020-03-31,01:54:20,Unnamed,"On the masks, sir. On the masks maybe for the doctors."
2020-03-31,01:54:22,Donald Trump,On what?
2020-03-31,01:54:23,Unnamed,On the masks. Is the reason why there’s no CDC recommendation for the public to wear masks because they’re meant to to save and preserve the mask for the medical workers or is it because the virus is not primarily transmitted through the air?
2020-03-31,01:54:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So there was a … The CDC does have recommendations on their website about masks that came to the task force several weeks ago about if you’re infected, wearing a mask to protect others. And if you can’t, you’re working with someone who’s sick and you have to be that worker in the household, because remember we want people in the household being taken care of, that they should wear a mask. I know your question is broader than that and it’s just being considered by the task force now about whether that recommendation that already exists relevant to wearing masks should be altered in any way. So it’s still under discussion."
2020-03-31,01:55:17,Donald Trump,"And just about masks. You can get a mask, but you can also do … I mean most people have scarves and scarves are very good and they can use a scarf and where are we talking about a limited period of time. And it says in the recommendations you can use … You can substitute a scarf for a mask. So if people feel that … And I think some people disagree with the mask for various reasons and some people don’t. But you can wear a scarf, you can do the masks if it makes you feel better. We have no objection to it and some people recommend it. Let’s go."
2020-03-31,01:55:52,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. President.
2020-03-31,01:55:54,Donald Trump,You people never get tired. Thank you. There’s still good questions.
2020-03-31,01:55:59,Unnamed,"Mr. President, again, I’m looking at the cases around the world in Latin America and the Middle East, and still you don’t want to impose a travel ban for these areas. In Brazil, for instance, the President Bolsanar, he keeps on being very active with groups. Aren’t you afraid that what we’re doing here can be threatening-"
2020-03-31,01:56:20,Donald Trump,You mean you people? You mean you people?
2020-03-31,01:56:21,Unnamed,"Not here, but in the United States."
2020-03-31,01:56:23,Donald Trump,"I mean, you’re pretty spread out already. I don’t have anymore … I don’t think we’ll have press conferences anymore, but-"
2020-03-31,01:56:28,Unnamed,I understand-
2020-03-31,01:56:29,Donald Trump,"Look, we’re very careful. I’m very careful personally, and-"
2020-03-31,01:56:33,Unnamed,"But the travel ban, I mean, aren’t you-"
2020-03-31,01:56:35,Donald Trump,"We are looking at numerous countries as they get in a position. Brazil as an example, you mentioned the president. Brazil had no problem until just a short time ago and now they’re starting to get inflamed and yes, we are absolutely looking at a ban. There are two other countries you mentioned, Iran already has a band. They had sort of an automatic ban. In addition to that, they have a band. So we’re looking at certain countries as they become hot."
2020-03-31,01:57:06,Unnamed,"So you’re starting a new 30 days now. What are your plans? Are you going to stay in the White House? Are you going to travel at all, or are you going to shelter-in-place?"
2020-03-31,01:57:12,Donald Trump,"I wanted to go to the opening of the hospital in New York, and my people couldn’t even believe it that I said it, but I did. I wanted to go. They didn’t want me to do it. The Secret Service didn’t want me to do it for reasons I wanted to go to the boat sailing into New York Harbor. But the governor did a good job of that, and the mayor of New York. So I love to go out but not be in the white house and it’s sort of like nerve center, control center and I think it’s important. Look, you see what happened with Boris Johnson, you see what happened with others. I think it’s important that I remain healthy. I really do. So for the most part we’re staying here. I’ve canceled many different events and we’ll be staying here, for the most part."
2020-03-31,01:58:03,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, Tom Frieden, the former director of the CDC wrote an article the other day in which she said what’s what’s really needed here [inaudible 01:58:13] the task force is doing is an incident commander, to take command of where everything is going and how things are coordinated. Do you have something that could be useful in this particular instance?"
2020-03-31,01:58:26,Donald Trump,We have it.
2020-03-31,01:58:27,Mike Pence,"His name is Pete Gaynor. He’s the administrator of FEMA, and when the president signed the national emergency declaration, he stood up the National Response Center at FEMA and now I can tell you that when the White House coronavirus task force meets, I’m at one end of the table and Pete Gaynor and the whole FEMA team are by video conference at the other end of the table, and that’s where whether it be the Airbridge that’s literally bringing in millions of medical supplies from around the world, the thoughtful deployment of those supplies to hospitals, particularly with regard to ventilators. We’re working very closely. HHS is fully integrated at FEMA now, but because of the president’s decision to stand up FEMA in the lead, we have a coronavirus task force at the White House that’s bringing the president the very best health experts and recommendations from every agency, all the implementation as we tell governors, literally every day is happening through FEMA. It’s going down to the States through FEMA and state requests are coming up through regional administrators for FEMA and back to the White House."
2020-03-31,01:59:42,Unnamed,"At the same time, we have 4,000 ventilators that are parked in a warehouse in New Jersey."
2020-03-31,01:59:47,Mike Pence,Not for long.
2020-03-31,01:59:47,Unnamed,"No, no, no, no, but that the case, we also have-"
2020-03-31,01:59:51,Mike Pence,"We moved them out. They had them a long time ago, but they didn’t need them."
2020-03-31,01:59:56,Unnamed,"But the question, the question is this happened. We also have people not knowing about the new Abbott testing facility or testing system. If there were an incident commander who was in charge of all of that and getting the word out, would that be useful?"
2020-03-31,02:00:12,Mike Pence,Nobody knew about Abbott. It was just brought to life two weeks ago. They just came up with it.
2020-03-31,02:00:17,Unnamed,That’s right.
2020-03-31,02:00:18,Mike Pence,It was an invention … So nobody knew about it. Nobody knew you could even do it. They did an incredible job. Their scientists came up with the idea of a week and a half ago. I showed it to you yesterday in the box. I don’t think you could do much better than that.
2020-03-31,02:00:31,Mike Pence,"If I may, Mr. President. I think your point’s well taken. The Abbott Laboratories point of contact test was approved Friday. President announced it in the Rose garden on Sunday. We’re socializing that all across the country, to every governor to laboratories elsewhere. And I have to tell you, this team that the president has assembled, the advisors on the White House coronavirus task force and then this team at FEMA, whether it be HHS deputy secretary Bob Kadelac, who’s coordinating all supplies, whether it be Admiral Zua are who is a literally working with every state on a county by county basis to deploy testing is impressive."
2020-03-31,02:01:16,Mike Pence,"I think it’s given great encouragement to governors, president and I spoke to governors in all the states and territories again yesterday because governors, I can tell you from my own experience as a governor. In Indiana, we had tornadoes and flooding, governors know how to deal with FEMA. And as soon as the president stood up FEMA, declared that national emergency, what I’ll call a certain amount of muscle memory kicked in in states around the country. And we’re really seeing a tremendous efficiency and communication, and that’s how we’re going to go forward. Again, the president’s vision here is FEMA’s vision, which is in response to a health crisis, it’s locally executed, state managed, federally supported. And I have to tell you, we’re seeing that whole process spinning up every day and I hope Americans looking on are encouraged by that system and I know they’re hearing from governors around the country about the flow of resources and testing and supplies and we’ll continue to keep that, what you call an incident command what, what we call the federal emergency management agency working 24/7"
2020-03-31,02:02:27,Donald Trump,"And I have to say this, I’ve had, in the last less than a week, three governors call up that truly have disliked me over the years. Even before I decided to run for president and they said, “I have to tell you, you’ve done a great job. You and your team have done a great job.” These are three governors respected, very respected in two cases and they said, “Like or not like, you and your team have done an incredible job.” And I think they have, I think they’ve done an incredible job. Go ahead, please."
2020-03-31,02:03:02,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thanks so much. My first question is on modeling. Was there any kind of health modeling based on whether or not there would be a national lockdown or if some sort of guidance to every single state that they needed to to have lockdowns?"
2020-03-31,02:03:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So all of the modelers who presented did … I mean, I just want to thank them again because they assembled from around the globe very quickly, about two or three weeks ago to before we announced the first 15 days to show all the implications of closing the schools, having people stay in their homes. And that’s how it was modeled. Stay in your homes, social distancing of six feet. So no one actually termed it a lockdown as far as I remember. It was more about staying in your home. And I think the difference was … And these weren’t in the models and I think when you talk about could we have known something different. I think all of us, I mean I was overseas when this happened in Africa and I think when you look at the China data originally and you said, “Oh, well there’s 80 million people or 20 million people in Wuhan and 80 million people in Hebei and they come up with a number of 50,000 you start thinking of this more like SARS than you do this kind of global pandemic."
2020-03-31,02:04:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I mean, I’ll just be frank, that’s when I looked at it I was like, “Oh, well this is not as close as those quarters are.” So I think the medical community made … Interpreted the Chinese data as that this was serious but smaller than anyone expected because I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data now that when we see what happened to Italy and we hate to see what happened to Spain. And so what was modeled is not a lockdown. Two countries did remove people from homes that were positive and put them in separate spaces. That also wasn’t modeled, but it could be modeled. And so we could go back and ask the modelers about lockdown versus not locked down. But what they modeled was people staying at home"
2020-03-31,02:05:23,Unnamed,"I guess what I was asking is for best case scenario, since it says best case scenarios, 100,000 people, I know you’re trying to get that number even lower, but is best case scenario every state basically having lockdown behavior, not maybe actual lockdowns, but basically everyone’s staying in their homes. And if that’s true, why not tell every state to do that?"
2020-03-31,02:05:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It’s everybody social distancing by six feet when they’re outside. And that is probably absolutely the key more than anything else is if you’re never more than … If you’re never within six feet of any single individual, then you’ve controlled the virus. There are different methods to get you to that point. And I think what I’ve heard from our president and our vice president is they trust the American people to understand that they can be outside, take walks, be six feet away from anyone else and be in their homes, and we trust them to do that without having to lockdown."
2020-03-31,02:06:26,Unnamed,"And then Mr. President, a question on ventilators."
2020-03-31,02:06:29,Donald Trump,"I just want to add, I think the one thing nobody really knew about this virus was how contagious it was. It’s so incredibly contagious, and nobody knew that. This is like a … I don’t know that anybody’s ever seen anything like this. Normally you’d have to get close and touch and this. A lot of things have to happen. This is just like … It’s truly invisible and so contagious and I don’t think any doctor knew it at the time. I don’t think anybody could have known it. People have not seen anything like this."
2020-03-31,02:07:00,Unnamed,"A question about ventilators. You talked about the fact that you don’t want to see States bidding against each other. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said that there should be a federal system where the federal government sets the price, the federal government distributes the ventilators. Why not have that kind of system? Why have this-"
2020-03-31,02:07:17,Donald Trump,"Essentially we do. We’ve distributed thousands of ventilators and we have now thousands of ventilators and we’re buying them at a good price and we’re actually making them by the thousands. We’re making them. You saw yesterday where Ford is going to have a tremendous number, they’re looking to make 100,000 ventilators. Ford has been great. General Electric healthcare has been great. General Motors has come a long way. I have to be honest. They are working very hard. We’re making thousands and thousands of ventilators. At the end of this, and there will be, don’t say I’m optimistic, because I don’t want to … I wouldn’t want to do that, but I am optimistic. I’m a very optimistic person. Let me tell you, we will have thousands of ventilators, and what I want to do is make sure that we always have plenty for the future, but then we want to help Italy and France and other countries that you don’t even know about yet with all of the problems they have, because ventilators are very tough to come by. They’re very hard to make, they’re very complicated, they’re very expensive. Yeah, please."
2020-03-31,02:08:16,Unnamed,Is Governor Cuomo mistaken then?
2020-03-31,02:08:17,Donald Trump,You can go ahead. Go ahead.
2020-03-31,02:08:19,Unnamed,Is Governor Cuomo mistaken when he’s saying-
2020-03-31,02:08:21,Donald Trump,"I can’t take your interpretation of what he said, I don’t know what he said. I think he’s been reasonably generous considering he’s a Democrat and I think he’d like to run for president. So I think he’s been pretty generous under those circumstances, but he’s been very generous to me. Look, I got them ships, I got them hospitals, I got them a lot of things that he never thought …. He hit pay dirt, okay? And I’ve been very generous on ventilators. If you look, they had 2,000 and 4,000 they had thousands of ventilators in his warehouse, in their warehouse waiting to be picked up. They never picked them up. So I’d have to hear it from him face to face. And how about one more and we’ll see you tomorrow. Is that okay? Don’t say got to cut it short-"
2020-03-31,02:09:07,John (Reporter),[inaudible 02:09:08].
2020-03-31,02:09:09,Donald Trump,"That’s right, it could be [inaudible 02:09:10] tomorrow, but you know what? In the meantime, I’m sure people are enjoying it. Now, I will say this, it’s an incredibly dark topic and incredibly horrible topic and it’s incredibly interesting. That’s why everybody is … They’re going crazy. They can’t get enough of it and they want to be careful and I guess they’re studying it for themselves. Just studying if they get it. A lot of people have it. A lot of people are positive and they hope for the best, because when this gets the wrong person, meaning a person that qualifies, generally speaking, under the list, it is ravaging. It is horrible. Go ahead. How about you, in the back?"
2020-03-31,02:09:52,Unnamed,"Thank you. Is there any data to suggest that you’re going to see a second wave at the point at which these stay at home orders, these lockdowns-"
2020-03-31,02:10:03,Donald Trump,"If we do see a second wave, because I’ve heard Dr. Fauci answer this question. If we do we’re going to be, I think, very well-prepared, and the second wave won’t be like the first wave, and with that I better let him give you a little bit more to that answer because I don’t want to have him upset with me and say, “I wish you would have answered that question.” Come on doctor."
2020-03-31,02:10:24,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So when you talk about second wave, I think you really are talking about two different things that are a little bit different. So for example, after the 30 days if we get the mitigation that we hope will get us to the suppression that Dr. Birx was talking about, there’s a danger if we don’t continue to maintain that, that we will have a resurgence right within the current outbreak. That’s sort of a second way, but it really is a exacerbation of the current wave. We hope that doesn’t happen and that’s why we’re really pushing and why I was so emphatic about making sure we abide by those mitigation strategies. The other aspect of a second wave is something that’s just the nature of a virus, that’s, as the president said, highly transmissible and is going to be circulating in other parts of the world as we’re going down, which I think we will, and I feel certain that we will. Then we have to worry about the next season, and as was just mentioned, that’s when you use the experience that you have, the interventions that you’ve developed, and hopefully a vaccine that you’ll be able to deploy as quickly as you possibly can. That’s that second wave that really is more seasonal than an exacerbation of something that you pull back on."
2020-03-31,02:11:44,Donald Trump,"A lot of very positive things are happening with the therapeutics and drugs of different kinds and the vaccines. I think a lot of very positive things are happening. Okay, one more. Please."
2020-03-31,02:11:56,Unnamed,"So understand the worst case scenarios, there is a real scarcity problem. If you’ve given out, say, 7,000 ventilators and we’ve got 10,000 around, so I’m just curious, who signs off on those life and death decisions before GM Ford ramp up?"
2020-03-31,02:12:09,Donald Trump,"I will say Mike Pence, myself, the head of FEMA, some of our generals that are working that are doing an unbeliever, we have generals that are working that are unbelievable talents, unbelievable leaders, and it’ll go through one of three or four people if it comes down to that. And I hope it doesn’t come down to that, because I think we’re very well-equipped, and it’s an honor to be here tonight. I appreciate it. I appreciate your interest. I think there is a great interest in it, and we’ll see you tomorrow. We’ll see you tomorrow. [crosstalk 02:12:42]."
2020-04-01,00:05,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. So America continues to wage all out war to defeat the virus, this horrible, horrible virus. You see how terrible it is, especially when you look at the numbers from yesterday. And we explained why we’re extending our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread for 30 days. Together we have the power to save countless lives. We’re attacking the virus in every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people. And we did that early, far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else. In this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us to achieve a total victory. As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there’s a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists, and other maligned actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain. And we must not let that happen. We will never let that happen."
2020-04-01,01:32,Donald Trump,"Today, the United States is launching enhanced counter narcotics operations in the Western hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics. We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives. In cooperation with the 22 partner nations, U.S. Southern Command will increase surveillance, disruption and seizures of drug shipments and provide additional support for eradication efforts which are going on right now at a record pace. We’re deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft and helicopters, Coast Guard cutters and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region. Very importantly, our forces are fully equipped with personnel protective equipment and we’ve taken additional safety measures to ensure our troops remain healthy. Secretary Mark Esper, Attorney General Bill Barr, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien will provide more details. In addition, I’m going to have General Milley, who’s done an incredible job so many ways, say a few words and also with us our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gilday, who you know, I think you know and Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz."
2020-04-01,03:04,Donald Trump,"So I’m going to ask Mark to start and then we can go and after that we’re going to take questions as it pertains to this and then we’ll go on to phase two, which is the virus itself. Okay, thank you, please, Mark."
2020-04-01,03:21,Mark Esper,"Well, thank you Mr. President and good afternoon everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today as we make this a very important announcement. At a time when the nation and the Department of Defense are focused on protecting the American people from the spread of the coronavirus, we also remain vigilant to the many other threats our country faces. Today, at the President’s direction, the Department of Defense in close cooperation with our inter-agency partners began enhanced counter-narcotics operations in Eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. This initiative is part of the administration’s whole of government approach to combating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and protecting the American people from their scourge."
2020-04-01,04:03,Mark Esper,"I want to thank all of our partners in this effort to include the United States Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Justice, and members of the intelligence community for the tremendous support and cooperation. To conduct these enhanced operations, the President has directed the deployment of additional ships, aircraft, and security forces to the United States Southern Command area of responsibility. Included in this force package are Navy destroyers and littoral combat ships, Coast Guard Cutters, P.A. patrol aircraft, and elements of an Army security force assistance brigade. These additional forces will nearly double our capacity to conduct counter-narcotics operations in the region. Additionally, 22 partner nations have joined us in this fight, bring with them a variety of intelligence and operations capabilities needed to defeat these criminal organizations. Last year alone, United States Southern Command’s operations resulted in the seizure of over 280 metric tons of drugs, much of which was designated for shipment to America."
2020-04-01,05:03,Mark Esper,"While this was an incredible achievement, there’s much more work to be done. Transnational criminal organizations continue to threaten our security by smuggling cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamines and other narcotics across our borders. These drug traffickers put our communities at risk and destroy lives. Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die from drug overdose and thousands more suffer the harmful effects of addiction. Furthermore, corrupt actors like the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela, rely on the profits derived from the sell of narcotics to maintain their oppressive hold on power. The Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro’s criminal control over the country. Drug traffickers are seizing on this lawlessness by increasing their illicit activities. We must do more to prevent these drugs from arriving at our shores. These enhanced counter-narcotics operations that are now underway will further disrupt the flow of illicit drugs to America, deny our adversaries the financial resources they depend on and build the capacity of our partner nations throughout the region."
2020-04-01,06:08,Mark Esper,"I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and support to this critical mission. This is particularly important time for this operation to begin. As nations around the world shift their focus inward to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, many criminal organizations are attempting to capitalize on this crisis. The enhanced operations we are announcing today will keep the pressure on these criminal groups and protect the American people from the devastation caused by the flow of illegal drugs into our country. Mr. President, thank you for your leadership as we begin this important operation. While the men and women of the United States military work hard here at home to fight the coronavirus, we continue to take action around the world to defend our great country. Thank you and I’d like to invite General Milley."
2020-04-01,06:54,General Milley,"Thank you Secretary for those words and thank you Mr. President for your leadership and I want to publicly thank Admiral Craig Fowler, the commander of U.S. Southern Command out of Miami for leading this operation, which is underway effective today. And also at Admiral Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Schultz for their contributions to this from their services. There’s thousands of sailors, Coast Guardsman, soldiers, airmen, Marines involved in this operation. We came upon some intelligence sometime ago that the drug cartels as a result of COVID-19 were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country. As we know that 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs, that’s unacceptable. We’re at war with COVID-19, we’re at war with terrorists and we are at war with the drug cartels as well. This was the United States military, you will not penetrate this country. You will not get past jump street. You’re not going to come in here and kill additional Americans."
2020-04-01,07:51,General Milley,"And we will marshal whatever assets are required to prevent your entry into this country to kill Americans. So right now the Navy has marshaled additional grey hull ships from both PACOM and EUCOM and for the Naval fleet at Norfolk. And they are set sail already and they’re in the Caribbean right now. In addition to that, there’s 10 Coast Guard Cutters and there’s special operations forces and security force assistance brigades along with Air Force reconnaissance aircraft. The bottom line is you’re not going to get through. Now is not the time to try to penetrate the United States with illegal drugs to kill Americans. We’re the United States military and we will defend our country, regardless of the cost. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Secretary."
2020-04-01,08:28,Donald Trump,"Thank you General, thank you."
2020-04-01,08:31,Bill Barr,"Thank you, Mr. President, thanks for your decisive leadership as we confront this unprecedented challenge posed by coronavirus. And I’d like to thank you for your support for this important initiative and thank all of the, Secretary of Defense and all the services for taking on this important initiative. Obviously during this crisis, we’re all focused above all else on COVID-19 but at the same time, our law enforcement and national security work must go forward protecting the American people from the full array of threats. For the Department of Justice, one of our highest priorities must remain destroying the Mexican cartels. Their trafficking is largely responsible for the deaths, as we all know now, of 70,000 Americans a year. And also the cost of this don’t count the destroyed families, the destroyed lives, the draining of our national treasure as state budgets are crushed by the burden that this narcotic trafficking causes."
2020-04-01,09:45,Bill Barr,"The President has made clear that we are in this fight against the cartels to win and that we are not interested in half-measures. And that the threat posed by the cartel is not just a law enforcement threat, but a national security threat as well. And in December, building on your success with the Mexican president and forging a cooperative relationship in the area of immigration, you asked me to go down and meet with the President Lopez Obrador and our Mexican counterparts to see if we could also establish a more comprehensive and coordinated effort with the Mexicans in confronting the cartels. And we’ve had some successful visits and discussions and currently have an array of activities underway against the cartels and we anticipate along with the Mexicans that these are going to bear fruit in the months ahead."
2020-04-01,10:45,Bill Barr,"But it quickly became clear that we can obtain the most immediate results, the best bang for the buck, where we increase the assets involved in interdiction on both the Pacific and Atlantic side of Mexico in the Central American countries. For years, the cartels have been using these sea routes to take the cocaine up from principally Columbia, now also out of Venezuela. And these sea routes on both coasts have become the primary means of bringing cocaine up to the United States. Because of the superb work done by the Defense Department and our intelligence community, we know exactly most of the time where these traffickers are at sea. But we’re significantly have been up til now, significantly limited in our ability to interdict because of the numbers of the assets we have deployed."
2020-04-01,11:45,Bill Barr,"Prior today, this limitation meant we could only intercept the fraction of the traffickers and the various boats that were detected. This will now double our capacity and we are talking about hundreds of tons of cocaine we’re now in a position to seize. So this is going to radically improve our interdiction efforts and put tremendous pressure we think on the cartels. And the effort that SOUTHCOM is undertaking is going to save lives by taking drugs off the street. Last week, I announced the unsealing of charges of narco terrorism drug trafficking and other crimes against the former Maduro regime, 16 members of that regime and their involvement in trafficking of 250 metric tons a year. A lot of that comes by sea, as I discussed at that time, but also because of the pressure we’re applying by our sea interdiction. They are trying to establish an air route out of Venezuela up into Central America, which is one of the reasons we’re trying to move firmly against that corrupt regime."
2020-04-01,12:59,Bill Barr,"You know, this drug war has gone on for many decades and at times in the past we’ve had great success and great results and at times we’ve taken our eye off the ball. Fortunately not in this administration, and I’m grateful that you, Mr. President, have brought focus to this fight and the determination to use whatever tools are necessary to win the fight. The cartels have to be defeated both for the people of this country and for the people of Mexico and Venezuela. So I’d like to thank you again, Mr. President, Secretary Esper for providing the wherewithal required to help win this war against the cartels and others who seek to send elicit drugs into our country. And with that, I’d like to introduce Ambassador O’Brien."
2020-04-01,13:50,Robert O’Brien,"Thank you, General, thank you, Mr. President. Today’s action is another example of the bold leadership of President Trump and his commitment to protecting the homeland against threats that seek to destabilize the United States and our Western hemisphere. The uncontrolled flow of illegal drugs into the United States poisons our communities, fuels the dangerous epidemic, an epidemic of addiction and threatens the safety and security of all Americans. The impressive U.S. Navy Coast Guard, Army, Marine Corps, Air Force and inter-agency operation will address a range of threats to our national security posed by narco traffickers and narco terrorists. It will reduce list financial support for drug trafficking that provides the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela and other bad actors with the funds necessary to conduct their malign activities. Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue to execute our maximum pressure policy to counter the Maduro regimes, malign activities including drug trafficking. And this operation will help to choke off the funds that go to that corrupt regime."
2020-04-01,14:55,Robert O’Brien,"Maduro, narco terrorists and criminals should make no mistake that even as we are working around the clock to fight the spread of coronavirus, we will continue to execute the President’s counter narcotic strategy. We’re working on a number of important national security priorities as we face this public health crisis. The United States will continue to combat disinformation and fake news about this virus. We will work with the world’s largest oil producers to address volatility in global oil markets. We will always protect our servicemen and servicewomen around the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. I want the American people to know that President Trump and Vice President Pence and their administration are working tirelessly every day to protect the health and wellbeing of Americans and respond to the coronavirus. Our adversaries should take note however, this President has a clear-eyed focus on America’s national security interest. And let me be clear, it would be a mistake, a mistake with terrible consequences for any adversary to attempt to do us harm during this health crisis or ever for that matter. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-01,16:07,Donald Trump,"So do we have any questions on this? Because this group is going to go back to work, they’re going to leave."
2020-04-01,16:13,Unnamed,"A question either for you, Mr. President or Secretary Esper, what has changed that is allowing these assets to be deployed now, whereas General Barr said in the past they were not [inaudible 00:16:23] ?"
2020-04-01,16:24,Donald Trump,"Well, for a long time we’ve had a lot of drugs coming into our country and it’s not that it’s increased, we’ve probably got it down a little bit, but it’s still a tremendous number of families are being ruined, lives are being ruined. It’s an incredible thing, especially as you’re at this position, you would never believe it. I see things that nobody would believe. I see reports that nobody would believe. So I met with the group behind me, all of them, and we said, what do you think we can do? And they think they can interdict, they that think we can stop it before it gets to the shores and they’re coming from all over the place and we have incredibly talented people. So I think I’m going to let Mark just give him a little bit of an answer to that. But we just want to see if we can stop a good percentage of the drugs coming into our country."
2020-04-01,17:14,Mark Esper,"Sure thing, thanks Mr. President. So first of all, it’s simply a matter of prioritization. The President’s giving us very clear guidance on what’s important to him in protecting the American people. And as some of you know, I began to review months ago looking at all of our different geographic combatant commands and looking at where we can free up time, money, and resources to put into other endeavors. In this case, we had scrutinized our inventory fairly closely, that Chairman Milley did a great deal of work on this with Admiral Gilday and we felt that there was no risk to the fleet, to our operations to free up, in this case Naval ships. We also freed up aircraft and other assets to apply them to this presidential priority. And of course, the Coast Guard did the same, so it was a very good operation. We feel this is very important to the American people and completely in line with the President’s direction."
2020-04-01,18:00,Unnamed,And how long will you be able to keep up this operational tempo?
2020-04-01,18:03,Mark Esper,"Well, it depends. What we’re going to do is we’re going to run it for some matter of time. I’m not going to disclose how long that will be and then we will assess it and then we’ll make adjustments from there. We may increase, we may decrease, we may sustain as is, but this will be an assessment we will do as an inter-agency team. We will report back to the President and we’ll take further guidance from there."
2020-04-01,18:22,Donald Trump,"[inaudible 00:18:22] didn’t do it for this reason, but it’ll also have an impact on the virus because we have people trying to get in, so not only drugs, but now we have a new phenomena. And that’s at least for the next hopefully short period of time, the virus, so we’ll be able to have an impact on that too. Please."
2020-04-01,18:36,Unnamed,"Yeah, Mr. President, could you expand on that a little bit because you tie it to COVID-19, saying that these drug cartels were taking advantage of the situation of this pandemic. How exactly-"
2020-04-01,18:47,Donald Trump,"Well, because we’re focused on so many other parts of the country and even parts of the world. And all of a sudden, areas where we had it clamped down pretty tight, in all fairness, the wall is up to about 160 miles already. And any areas where we have that wall, it’s for the most part contiguous, we have fill-ins but we’re up to 161 miles exactly. And any place where you have that wall, other than walking around it on the edges, it’s stopping everybody cold. I mean, we’re stopping … Nobody’s seen anything like it, that’s how good it works. And the other side knew had worked that well. Everybody, because everybody was for it five years ago, all of a sudden they changed."
2020-04-01,19:27,Donald Trump,"It’s having a tremendous impact. But we are now focused on so many different things because of what’s happened, because of this horrible, I say it’s a horrible phenomena that now we’ve got to focus on drugs and the drugs come in from different methods and we have the best people at sea anywhere in the world. So we’ll have a tremendous impact on drugs. But one of the other things, we’ll also have an impact we think on the virus. Yeah, please."
2020-04-01,19:54,Unnamed,"Ambassador O’Brien, did a China under report, both the number of cases and the death toll from the coronavirus. And if that’s the case, Mr. President, what does that mean for our relationship with China and your relationship with President Xi?"
2020-04-01,20:09,Robert O’Brien,"Well number one, I think the President has a great relationship with President Xi, and we’d like to have a great relationship with China. Unfortunately, we’re just not in a position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of China. There is no way to confirm any of those numbers. There’s lots of public reporting on whether the numbers are too low. You’ve got access to those reports that are coming out of the Chinese social media and some of the few reporters that are left in China. We just have no way to confirm any of those numbers. Thank you."
2020-04-01,20:34,Donald Trump,"We really don’t know, how do we know whether they under reported or reported however they report. But we had a great call the other night. We’re working together on a lot of different things including trade. They’re buying a lot, they’re spending a lot of money and they’re giving it to our farmers. They’re paying our farmers for the product. So we’re going to continue that along. John, yeah."
2020-04-01,20:55,Unnamed,"I have another one, sir. You tweeted earlier today that you have uncovered intelligence that there is a sneak attack being planned against American troops, America assets in Iraq. Are we talking about Kataib Hezbollah again? I’ll also-"
2020-04-01,21:10,Donald Trump,"I know what you’re saying, but we just have information that they were planning something and it’s very good information. It was led by Iran, not necessarily Iran, but by groups supported by Iran, but that to me is Iran. And we’re just saying, don’t do it, don’t do it, it would be a very bad thing for them if they did it."
2020-04-01,21:31,Unnamed,"The last time they did do it in early March at Camp Taji, there was a response from the military against Kataib Hezbollah alone, your tweets-"
2020-04-01,21:41,Donald Trump,"I had a very powerful response by the way, that response knocked out five different places, but it also took out a lot of very bad people."
2020-04-01,21:48,Unnamed,"Your tweets seem to suggest though that if it happens again, it may go up the food chain."
2020-04-01,21:52,Donald Trump,"Well, that was a very big response, we knocked out a lot. We looked at … they had one side, we hit five big ones and ammunition sites. You saw what happened, and I won’t say how many people were killed, but some bad people were killed and a lot of them. That was a big response. But this response will be bigger, if they do something. Yeah and you had one, please."
2020-04-01,22:13,Unnamed,"Yes, thank you Mr. President. Just going back to your conversation with President Xi, wondering if you received an intelligence report that talked about the discrepancy in the numbers and if you addressed that with-"
2020-04-01,22:25,Donald Trump,"We have not received that, but their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side and I’m being nice when I say that, relative to what we witnessed and what was reported. But we discussed that with him, not so much the numbers, as what they did and how they’re doing. And we’re in constant communication with the … I mean, I would say the biggest communication is myself and President Xi. The relationship’s very good. Look, they will be spending when things even out, this is obviously a little bit of a hurdle what’s happened over the last month, but they’ll be spending $250 billion buying our product. $50 billion to the farmers alone, $200 billion to other things. They never did that before. So we have a great trade deal and we’d like to keep it. They’d like to keep it and the relationship is good. As to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I’m not an accountant from China."
2020-04-01,23:26,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:23:26] things at all in terms of the trade deals?
2020-04-01,23:28,Donald Trump,"No, because people just don’t know. People don’t know. Where did it come from? I think we all understand where it came from and President Xi understands that and we don’t have to make a big deal out of it. We didn’t like the fact that they said it came from our soldiers and they haven’t pursued that. And that a mid-level person said that, that was not a high level person. So I will always assume the best. I’ll assume the high level people didn’t know about it. It was a foolish statement. So look, the relationship with China is a good one and my relationship with him is really good. Please."
2020-04-01,24:03,Unnamed,"Can I follow up just on that point on Chinese propaganda that you mentioned as well as an Ambassador O’Brien. So in the past several weeks, China has been shipping PPEs, masks. They’ve either been selling or donating everywhere, Africa, Europe, Italy, Russia, and really pushing this narrative that they’re taking on a global leadership role in the crisis. So what are your thoughts on that and is there any plan for your administration to take on that role?"
2020-04-01,24:27,Donald Trump,"Oh, I don’t mind if they want … Yeah, I feel that is a positive if they’re helping other countries. We have 151 countries right now that are under siege by the virus, under siege. Some are doing really badly, they don’t know about social distancing. These are countries that aren’t highly sophisticated. They don’t have great communication to the rest of the world. I mean, they don’t know the things that we’re doing and that some others are able to do. And if China can help them, I’m all for it. I’m for all of us helping everybody. We’re soon going to have more ventilators than we need. We’re building thousands of ventilators right now. Now, it takes a period of time to build them. And again, nobody could have known a thing like this could happen. We’re building thousands. We will fairly soon be at a point where we have far more than we can use. Even after we stockpile for some future catastrophe, which we hope doesn’t happen. We’re going to be distributed them, the extras around the world. We’ll go to Italy, we’ll go to France, we’ll go to Spain, which is very hard hit."
2020-04-01,25:29,Unnamed,"On that note, is there any truth on reporting that your administration is stopping shipment of USAID stockpiles of PPEs abroad?"
2020-04-01,25:36,Donald Trump,"No, no truth whatsoever."
2020-04-01,25:38,Unnamed,So your administration is not-
2020-04-01,25:38,Donald Trump,"I would love China and other countries if they have additional supplies, medical supplies to give to other countries. 151, why would I stop that? Wouldn’t it be terrible to stop it?"
2020-04-01,25:51,Unnamed,Is the U.S. stopping shipment of our own stockpile through USAID to other countries?
2020-04-01,25:56,Donald Trump,"Whatever we have, whatever we’ve committed to, we commit, but we also need a lot for ourselves, so we’re very focused on that until we get over this. So obviously, we’re not going to be shipping too much until now. We do have excess of certain things and we don’t have enough of others. I just had a great talk today with Doug McMillan from Walmart and I gave him a very, very big order for gowns, for protective gear, for the doctors, for the nurses, for everything. And he’s actually very excited about it. He’s the biggest purchaser of this kind of thing. I mean of anything probably in the world. And he is very excited about it. And he said, what size? I said, it’s almost an unlimited."
2020-04-01,26:39,Donald Trump,"When you look at these hospitals, the amount that they order, you almost say, how could they possibly use so much, whether it’s masks or the protective gear. But we are supplying a tremendous amount and we just ordered a lot from Walmart. And he’s taken this on personally. And I said, let it be shipped not to a warehouse directly to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it because we save a lot of-"
2020-04-01,27:03,Donald Trump,"Play to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it because we save a lot of time when we do that. So Walmart, in addition to many other companies and people, is now involved at the highest level. Please."
2020-04-01,27:14,Unnamed,The announcements that were made today are aimed at curbing the flow of narcotics into the country. Are you concerned that we’re possibly losing ground on the drug crisis while we’re…
2020-04-01,27:24,Donald Trump,"I don’t think we’re losing ground, but we don’t want to lose ground. That’s why we’re doing it. I don’t want to lose ground. It’s a big fight. I’ve seen many families where they’re wiped out because they lost a son or a daughter or a husband or a wife or whatever. Or all of them and we don’t want to lose ground and we are heavily focused on the virus, very heavily focused. After this goes into effect, which essentially is now, we will never have been so focused on drugs coming into our country as we are right now. And remember, as that wall gets bigger, that really helps us a lot. Really helps us a lot. Yeah, please."
2020-04-01,27:59,Mark Esper,Is the Mexican government or any other Latin American government working in conjunction with this operation to help with that drug?
2020-04-01,28:06,Donald Trump,"Many of the governments are, and Mexico in particular is. In Mexico right now, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border keeping people out of our country and very few people are coming into our country right now and as we complete, again the wall, in addition to the 27,000 soldiers, it’s a very tough place to come into."
2020-04-01,28:30,Donald Trump,"When I took over, people were coming in and they were bringing whatever they wanted. They were bringing drugs of any type and now, it’s very hard for them. And it will get harder and harder. But the president of Mexico is a great guy who has really helped us a lot. 27,000 Mexican soldiers. And you remember when I first took over, they had all of the caravans coming up with 10,000, 15,000 people in the caravans. They were marching through Mexico. That’s not happening anymore. Please, in the back?"
2020-04-01,29:02,Unnamed,"Mr President, are narco-militants such as the FARC 57th Front out of Columbia or the Maduro regime, do you know if they’re working in conjunction with the Mexican cartels? Is there any intelligence indicating that?"
2020-04-01,29:16,Donald Trump,"I cannot tell you. I know the answer to that, I believe I do, but I cannot tell you that. We have information that would lead us to believe something very powerfully. But I cannot tell you the answer to that. Yeah, please? [inaudible 00:29:33]"
2020-04-01,29:33,Unnamed,"Mr President, have US forces in Iraq taken the precautions because of this particular attack? And have you…"
2020-04-01,29:39,Donald Trump,"Sure. They’re taking precautions and we are watching it very closely and if something bad happens, it’s going to be very painful for the other side."
2020-04-01,29:47,Unnamed,Have you been in touch with the Iraqi government about this?
2020-04-01,29:50,Donald Trump,They know about it. Yeah. They know.
2020-04-01,29:52,Unnamed,Are they offering additional protection?
2020-04-01,29:53,Donald Trump,"We’ll see. We’ll see what happens, but we’re down to a small force now over the years. Since I got, we’ve been bringing smaller and smaller, and we’re down right now to a small number, but we have very powerful air power there. We have the big base. I mean, nobody can get near it. Nobody can even get near that. But we’ve really largely left, we’ve taken tremendous amounts out and we’ve deployed them elsewhere, including bringing some back home."
2020-04-01,30:28,Unnamed,And do you think tweeting about it will help prevent that from happening? Or perhaps [crosstalk 00:30:32]
2020-04-01,30:34,Donald Trump,"It’s social media, it gets out. I have hundreds of millions of people, number one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I just found out I’m number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice, for whatever it means. It represents something and when I can explain to people just don’t do it. It’s going to be bad if you do, it’s going to be really bad and they don’t need to do it, they have enough problems. Iran has enough problems without doing that. But we’ve been pulling back very substantially over the last year in Iraq. And so, that’s the way it is."
2020-04-01,31:08,Unnamed,"You said before, you don’t want to give the enemy, whoever that is in this case, a heads up, do you feel like maybe you did?"
2020-04-01,31:16,Donald Trump,"No, I’m just giving them a warning, it’s not a heads up. I’m giving them a warning. There’s a big difference. I’m saying if you do anything to hurt our troops, they’re going to pay a price. Now, as per the question, they did last time. We didn’t make a big deal out of it, but we hit very, very hard five massive major ammunition sites and a lot of people went with it. A lot of bad people. A lot of enemy went with it and we didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but they paid a big price. They’ll pay a much bigger price this time if they do anything."
2020-04-01,31:49,Unnamed,"Now that we have Admiral Gilday here, perhaps we could ask a question about what the plans are for the Roosevelt, sir?"
2020-04-01,31:55,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-04-01,31:59,Admiral Gilday,"In terms of Roosevelt, we’re making great progress in terms of testing and also moving people off the ship. So, in the past day or so, we’ve moved over a thousand. That number will increase to more than 2,700 by Friday, as we continue to increase the testing as well and fly those samples off. So again, pretty quickly."
2020-04-01,32:19,Unnamed,And will the ship remain fully operational?
2020-04-01,32:21,Admiral Gilday,It is fully operational now.
2020-04-01,32:23,Unnamed,And will remain so?
2020-04-01,32:24,Admiral Gilday,It will remain so.
2020-04-01,32:26,Unnamed,"Just a followup to that, what protocols are you putting in place to help mitigate the spread of coronavirus among service men and women who live [crosstalk 00:32:33]."
2020-04-01,32:33,Admiral Gilday,"Across the fleet, before we have any ships getting underway for training exercises, for deployments, those sailors are spending 14 days in quarantine before they get underway. We’ve increased the amount of testing equipment as well as physicians on board our ships at sea. So, we’ve taken additional steps since the beginning of the COVID crisis."
2020-04-01,32:52,Donald Trump,Not too many people are going to be getting off at various ports anymore. Right? I think we-
2020-04-01,32:59,Admiral Gilday,Correct.
2020-04-01,32:59,Donald Trump,We probably have decided on that.
2020-04-01,33:03,Unnamed,You mean civilians?
2020-04-01,33:04,Donald Trump,"Thank you. No, military people, on ships."
2020-04-01,33:09,Mark Esper,"I’d like to add one thing to that. There seems to be this narrative out there that we should just shut down the entire United States military and address the problem that way. That’s not feasible. We have a mission. Our mission is to protect the United States of America and our people. And so, we live and work in cramped quarters, whether it’s an aircraft carrier, a submarine, a tank, a bomber, it’s the nature of our business. But the chain of command has very clear guidance and I’m confident between the commanding officers and the senior non-commissioned officers, they’re taking every reasonable precaution to make sure we practice as best we can, social distancing, sanitizing environments, et cetera, consistent with that mission. And that’s what I trust Admiral Gilday, acting Secretary Modly and all the other service chiefs and service leaders to do. And I’m confident we’ll do that, because keep in mind, we have a job to do and we will continue to do it. Defend the United States of America."
2020-04-01,33:57,Unnamed,"Mr President, you mentioned the stockpile earlier, the Washington Post reported today that the US stockpile is nearly depleted of PPE. Is that the case? And if so, how are you planning to mitigate?"
2020-04-01,34:06,Donald Trump,"It is because we’re sending directly to hospitals. We don’t want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it after it arrives and bring it to various states and hospitals. One of the things, and again, we asked the states to do this as much as possible, many of the states have people that, whether it’s that or clothing, they make clothing, lots of clothing in many of the different states. We said, “See if you can get it directly from those manufacturers, make a deal, we’ll use the purchase act if we have to on them, if they won’t.” By the way, so many people are… The spirit is incredible, what they’re doing, but we’ve asked States where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants, and have it made directly, ship it right into the hospitals. We’re shipping things right in."
2020-04-01,34:54,Donald Trump,"We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators, which we need for flexibility. It’s a lot. It sounds like a lot, but it’s not because as you see on the board from yesterday, as this scourge, as this plague, as this virus moves, it moves very fast and we don’t know yet whether we’re going to need it in Louisiana, in New York, wherever it may be. So we’re ready for it. We’re totally ready for it. We’re going to be shipping out, we’ve already agreed to ship out over a thousand today to different sites, different locations, but we have to have the flexibility of moving the ventilators to where the virus is going. And we’ll be able to see that from charts a couple of days in advance. So right now, we have a nice pile of ventilators."
2020-04-01,35:39,Donald Trump,"We have a lot more coming in. I think we have 11 companies making ventilators right now. Very good companies and they’re making them. You know about Ford, you know about General Motors, but we have a lot of companies making the ventilators right now. So, now the question is, when you make one, it doesn’t get made in 15 minutes. A mask can go quickly, a ventilator takes time to build. It’s very, very, as we discussed, it’s complex, it’s big, gets expensive, et cetera. But we’ll be able to move. We have great flexibility. John?"
2020-04-01,36:13,John (Reporter),"I was just going to say, sir, do you want to move on to solely coronavirus or stick with-"
2020-04-01,36:17,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I think if… Does anybody have any other questions for this great group of brilliant people? Yes, please?"
2020-04-01,36:24,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr President. Question for Secretary Asper. The military personnel has been fanned out across the country to help combat the virus, is there any chance that they’re planning to see at some point having military personnel treat or see COVID-19 patients?"
2020-04-01,36:42,Mark Esper,"Well, excuse me. As you know, we have the hospital ships currently deployed, one in LA and one in New York city. So, they could be treating patients as they come in. We’re taking precautionary measures to screen them beforehand to make sure that they’re not exposed, if you will. Same with the military hospitals that we’re deploying, certainly again to New York, Seattle, and other places. But the one thing we got to be careful of is that these are deployable assets. They are unique."
2020-04-01,37:08,Mark Esper,"So, if we want to retain the ability to deploy military doctors, expeditionary military hospitals around the country, we’ve got to preserve and protect them as best we can. That said, we remain completely available to assist as need be, as directed by FEMA, as the vice president and the president asks us, that’s what we commit to do to the American people to help safeguard them and protect them through this virus."
2020-04-01,37:30,Unnamed,"So as part of that, will they be seeing coronavirus patients or will they strictly be seeing other patients and helping them?"
2020-04-01,37:36,Mark Esper,"They could if called upon. I think the best use for them is based on their training and how they’re structured and organized is for trauma. We can take the load off of hospitals with regard to their trauma patients, thereby freeing up rooms and other doctors, particularly doctors who are respiratory nurses or doctors who deal with infectious disease to treat those types of patients. So, I think it’s the best use of our resources. But again, if push comes to shove, we’re prepared to do what we have to, to assist the American people. At the same time preserving the medical capability we need to support our operation deployed forces abroad."
2020-04-01,38:09,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at doing two additional brand new hospital ships because these ships have really struck a blow, a very positive blow for what they’re doing. Going into Los Angeles, going into New York. So, we’re looking very seriously at building two additional ships of about the same size."
2020-04-01,38:30,Unnamed,Building two new ones or deploying two new ones?
2020-04-01,38:32,Donald Trump,"Well, building but we’re looking at building either two new ones or doing the renovation of another large ship. But this has really worked out well. So probably two brand new ones. [crosstalk 00:38:42]"
2020-04-01,38:42,Donald Trump,Is this concerning the gentleman or do you want them… You don’t want them to get back to work and capture all those bad people?
2020-04-01,38:51,Unnamed,"A followup Mr President or Mr Secretary, I know that Secretary Wilkie has said he’s on standby waiting to hear if VA hospitals doors need to be opened to civilians. Are you talking about that? [crosstalk 00:39:04] Could we see that? How soon could that happen?"
2020-04-01,39:07,Donald Trump,"Yeah, it can move very quickly. He’s a very capable man. We’re ready to move very quickly. As an example, in Louisiana, they have a very big hospital, so we’re looking to move very quickly. If we need them. Hopefully we won’t need them."
2020-04-01,39:20,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:39:20] soon?
2020-04-01,39:20,Donald Trump,"We’re going to find out pretty soon. We’re only going to know at the time it happens. We prepare for the worst. We are preparing for the worst. Unfortunately, that’s the way we have to look at it."
2020-04-01,39:31,Unnamed,"Just to followup on the purpose of these Naval ships, you mentioned something about treating trauma patients and I’m just curious, what about things like giving birth? Would mothers be expected in New York for example?"
2020-04-01,39:43,Donald Trump,"Well, as I understand, they’re not doing that on the ship. That’s the one thing they’re not doing outside of the COVID-19. They’re not doing that. The birth of a baby not being done on the ships."
2020-04-01,39:54,Unnamed,Okay. Can I have a followup question with attorney general Barr please? This has to do with the visa restrictions of immigrant doctors. Is the administration considering easing the restrictions or waving restrictions for doctors with J1 or H-1 B visas so they can help other doctors during this crisis?
2020-04-01,40:16,William Barr,"Actually, the immigration laws are no longer under the administration of the Department of justice and I haven’t been participating in any of those discussions."
2020-04-01,40:25,Unnamed,"What about you, Mr President? Can you respond to that question, Mr President? [crosstalk 00:40:28]"
2020-04-01,40:27,Donald Trump,"One more for this group right here, please."
2020-04-01,40:32,Unnamed,"Secretary Esper, this is on the topic of coronavirus in Iran, the WHO confirms that Iran is vastly under reporting its coronavirus cases. Not just cases, but fatalities. According to on the ground estimates, that might be as high as 15 and a half thousand deaths. 32 commanders in the military in Iran are now confirmed either in dire condition or dead. You have eight percent of the parliament now down with coronavirus. So, is Iran’s soundings of aggressions today, that President Trump just tweeted about, do you think strategically, is that a bluff on their part or is this a sign of very clear desperation? Where are you strategically on that?"
2020-04-01,41:15,Mark Esper,"Well, first and foremost, we empathize for the Iranian people. I mean, they clearly have been hit hard as you know. I think the president’s spoken about it, certainly Secretary Pompeo. We’ve offered assistance, we’ve offered medical supplies, et cetera. They have refused that. I think if the Iranian regime put more interest in terms of taking care of their people in the context of this virus, they would be better served. Instead, the Iranian regime continues to want to spread its malign activities throughout the region. They want to continue to send out the [inaudible 00:14:42] force and others to cause problems throughout the region."
2020-04-01,41:46,Mark Esper,"We know that in one way, shape or form, they either, resourcing, directing, approving or whatever operations for Shia militia groups in Iraq that are targeting American forces. So I think at the end of the day, again, I feel deep concern for the Iranian people, the important thing is the Iranian government should focus on them and stop this malign behavior that they’ve been conducting now for over 40 years. I think the entire region and certainly the Iranian people would be better off for it."
2020-04-01,42:15,Donald Trump,"And I happen to think they want to make a deal. They just don’t know really how to start and they’ve been given some bad advice by former Secretary Kerry. It’s a very bad advice and I really think they want to make a deal, which is the Logan act, but we’d have to look at the Logan act. All you have to do is take a look. I think they’ve been given very bad advice by Secretary Kerry. I think they’re dying to make a deal. Look, their country’s in trouble. Their economics are shot. They’ve got a lot of bad things going. I think they’d like to make a deal. They can get it settled very quickly. No nuclear weapons. They can’t have nuclear weapons. It’s very simple. Okay, let’s let these folks get back to work. Is that okay? Thank you all very much."
2020-04-01,43:16,Donald Trump,"So as we deploy our service members to combat both threats abroad, invisible enemy at home, earlier today I spoke to our nation’s incredible warriors and military families. Spent a long time of the phone with thousands and thousands of families that were hooked in. In order to stop the spread of the virus, some of these families have delayed planned moves to their next duty station and in other cases, military families are also waiting longer to welcome home the heroes from deployment. There’s a tremendous burden to bear and the families have been involved with us for so long and they are incredible. Without the families, they couldn’t be the great service members that they turned out to be. And they understand that. And I must say, protecting our military families is our top priority."
2020-04-01,44:07,Donald Trump,"So, they understand what’s happening with respect to the virus and they understand it well. They’ve been fantastic. As commander in chief, I’m deeply grateful for our service members, their spouses and their children, whose love, devotion and sacrifice keeps America strong. To make, procure and deliver a crucial medical supplies to our doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, my administration is leveraging the might of American manufacturing supply chains and innovators across the industry and across every industry and I just told you about Walmart and I could tell you about many more. Hanes is making protective gear and masks and we’re making tremendous amounts of product."
2020-04-01,44:54,Donald Trump,"There’s never been anything like it. At the same time, I tell the governors, get it yourself if you can from your local companies and your local warehouses and factories. If you can do that, you should do that. Because of the actions that we’ve taken under the Defense Production Act, manufacturers and suppliers are sharing with FEMA and HHS their planned orders and allocations to states and to hospitals all over the region. This enables FEMA and HHS to work closely with states, local governments and private sector to allocate critical resources to highly impacted areas. Working together, we’re entirely focused on getting materials to the right place at the right time. So, we wanted to go directly to a hospital or directly to a certain state location and ideally, not even hit the state’s warehouses. If we can avoid the warehouses, it’s even better because they go directly into a hospital."
2020-04-01,45:50,Donald Trump,"And one example of that is Ohio, the great state of Ohio. Senator Rob Portman called today and he asked for some help and got us… Did a tremendous job along with Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, to facilitate a donation of 2.2 million gowns. 2.2 million gowns, think of what that is, 2.2 million to the strategic national stockpile from Ohio based Cardinal health. Cardinal health, we appreciate it and they’re making much more than that and different types of things."
2020-04-01,46:27,Donald Trump,"We’re profoundly grateful for their contribution to protect the lives and safety of our healthcare professionals. Cardinal’s been working with us very well. FEMA and HHS formed a historic partnership with a private sector called Project Airbridge to bring supplies from other countries to the United States, including gloves, gowns, goggles and masks. These supplies will soon be distributed around the country. We have large cargo planes coming in from various parts of the world. Every day, new plane loads are landing in cities such as New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles."
2020-04-01,47:03,Donald Trump,"Additional flights have been scheduled and we’re adding more and more and they’re actually coming in ahead of schedule. A lot of these flights are coming in with a lot of material ahead of schedule, The amount of usage, the amount of need is something that nobody’s ever seen before. We are getting so much, but no matter how much we get, they seem to use it up very quickly. More than 17,000 national guard personnel have now been activated all across our country. On Tuesday, the vice-president sent a letter to the governors calling on them to have plans in place to use the national guard to move medical supplies from warehouses to hospitals. So, a lot of times we’ll deliver supplies to our in a state, someplace in New York or in New Jersey or in Connecticut or wherever it may be, and they’re having difficulty getting it moved."
2020-04-01,47:57,Donald Trump,"So what we’re doing, if we don’t bring it directly to the hospital, is we’ve authorized, it was a special authorization, the national guard to go into that facility and to move it for the state. So, the national guard is moving a lot of this equipment and medical supplies into a hospital or into an area where it’s needed by the state. As I said yesterday, difficult days are ahead for our nation. We’re going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now that are going to be horrific, but even in the most challenging of times, Americans do not despair. We do not give into fear. We pull together, we persevere and we overcome and we win. This week, every American heart is joined with the people of New York as they continue to bear the brunt of the pandemic. To every New Yorker, please know that we are by your side."
2020-04-01,48:56,Donald Trump,"I love New York and every day we will be with you and it could very well be that others take over from New York. There are some areas, some hotspots in other States that are really exploding. Some, like Louisiana, were very late and then all of a sudden, it was like an explosion. In confronting this deadly plague, America’s armed with capabilities never dreamed of in past centuries. You look at 1917, the pandemic, it was something. Ravaged parts of this country, but ravaged Europe. Ravaged. They say 75 to 100 million, some people say 50 to 75 million people died. Think of that and that was a long time ago, over a hundred years ago. Many books written about the 1917, 1918 pandemic."
2020-04-01,49:58,Donald Trump,"Our doctors are pouring over the virus. Genetic code, designing potential therapies and vaccines. Our planes are airlifting supplies from every corner of the earth. We’re watching other countries and they’re watching us to see whether or not, and who’s going to be the first to come up with a cure or a remedy of some kind or even a help, if it can help."
2020-04-01,50:21,Donald Trump,"And of course, a vaccine. We’re looking very strongly for a vaccine. Johnson and Johnson is doing well and other companies are doing very well. But our most powerful asset, our greatest weapon in this effort is the spirit of our people and we want to keep away, keep a distance, keep away. If you don’t get it, it solves a lot of problems. If you don’t get it, and you can’t get it if you keep the distance. American spirit is unyielding, unwavering and unbreakable. It’s incredible. I’ve never seen anything like it. The way the people have pulled together, the unity of this country. So, together we’re going to win this war and the sooner we do, the sooner we can begin to rebuild and we’re ready to rebound and return to normal lives. We went from the best economy of the history of the world, the best economy that this country has ever seen, the best employment numbers we’ve ever had."
2020-04-01,51:18,Donald Trump,"160 million people working, almost 160 million to a point where the professionals came to me and they say, “Sir, you’re going to have to shut the country down.” I said, ” What does that mean?” They said, “Sir, you’re going to have to shut it down.” And we’re going to build it up and I think we’re going to build it up fast. I think we’re going to have a tremendous rebound. There’s a great energy and a great pent up demand, and as you know, phase three was terrific and phase four, what passed in Congress, and phase four if that happens will be great."
2020-04-01,51:55,Donald Trump,"I already proposed paying almost zero interest on bonds and I proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which would not only fix our roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and other things, but will also do something very good, it’s called jobs. I’m also asking that restaurants and entertainment facilities go back to the old deductibility from corporations, where corporations can buy, because otherwise a lot of these restaurants have got to have a hard time reopening. It takes a long time and they’re going to have a hard time reopening. So we’re asking for going back to deductibility where corporations can buy and corporations can go out to lunch and they pay and they get a deduction on what they eat. They get a deduction on the bill, and same with the entertainment. It’s going to bring a lot of people back. I think it’ll open up the restaurant business."
2020-04-01,52:48,Donald Trump,"People forget that years ago they had that and when they got rid of it, when they ended it for whatever reason, but they ended it, many, many restaurants went out of business. Many entertainment type facilities went out of business and now’s a great time to bring it back. It was a terrible time for that business after they ended it, but this is a great time to bring it back. It’ll keep our restaurants going. In fact, I think the restaurant business will be actually bigger and better than it is right now. So, we’re also talking about that. And now, what we’ll do is we’ll take some questions and I see Mike is back with some of the folks. That’s great, Dr Fauci. And we will… Oh, how are you? Thank you Debra. So we’ll take some questions and we make progress day by day. Please?"
2020-04-01,53:38,Unnamed,"Mr President, yesterday you were talking about a friend you had who was in a coma. I’m sorry to hear your friend’s going through that, but you said this is no flu. There’s still some people who kind of think of this as a flu and over the past month, you’ve compared it to the flu sometimes, saying treat it like the flu or [inaudible 00:53:56] we handle the flu. So what changed your thinking on that? Well, your language on that?"
2020-04-01,54:01,Donald Trump,I think the severity. I think also in looking at the…
2020-04-01,54:03,Unnamed (Reporter),… thinking on that. Who are you aligning with on that?
2020-04-01,54:03,Donald Trump,"I think the severity. I think, also, in looking at the way that the contagion… It is so contagious. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this where large groups of people, all of a sudden just by being in the presence of somebody having… The flu has never been like that. Flu is contagious, but nothing like we’ve ever seen here. Also the violence of it. If it hits the right person, and you know what those stats are. If it hits the right person, that person’s in deep trouble. And my friend was the right person."
2020-04-01,54:33,Unnamed (Reporter),"When you heard about that, with your friend, was that a turning point?"
2020-04-01,54:36,Donald Trump,"No. Not a turning point. Before then, I knew how… Because I’m seeing numbers that I’m seeing, statistics that are not exactly very good. But it hit him very hard. He’s strong. A very strong kind of a guy, but he’s older, he’s heavier, and he’s sort of central casting for what we’re talking about, and it hit him very hard. I’ve never seen anything like it. Yeah, [John 00:55:01] ."
2020-04-01,55:01,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, and maybe this is a question as well for Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci, Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted last night, and we checked today that there are still flights that are running between the hotspots like New York and Detroit, New Orleans as well. A number of flights were completed today. Senator Graham’s point is, if you’re going to declare mitigation, should it not be full mitigation, and you stop people from traveling?"
2020-04-01,55:26,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re thinking about doing that. At the same time we just… to start these airlines and to start this whole thing over again is very tough, john. It’s very tough. And you have them going, in some cases, from hotspot to hotspot. If you notice, they’re usually hotspot to hotspot. Very few flights, New York to Miami, but we’re certainly looking at it, but once you do that, you really are clamping down an industry that is desperately needed."
2020-04-01,55:58,John (Reporter),But how do you make that calculation as to whether or not you keep the industry going-
2020-04-01,56:01,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to."
2020-04-01,56:01,John (Reporter),Are your risks spreading to change that?
2020-04-01,56:03,Donald Trump,That is a calculation that we’re looking at right now. We’re looking at it very strongly. Please.
2020-04-01,56:07,Unnamed (Reporter),"So let me follow up to that, Mr. President. Not every governor has issued a stay at home order. All of you have made it very clear how important it is to stay home, that we are in a dire situation here. And that’s how you stop the spread, is the staying home."
2020-04-01,56:22,Donald Trump,"Yeah, sure."
2020-04-01,56:22,Unnamed (Reporter),"Why not take the power out of the hands of the governors, and you just issue a stay at home order for every state in this country?"
2020-04-01,56:31,Donald Trump,"Because states are different, and I understand that the Governor of Florida, great governor, Ron DeSantis issued one today, and that’s good, that’s great. But there are some states that are different. There are some States that don’t have much of a problem. There are some, well, they don’t have the problem. They don’t have thousands of people that are positive or thousands of people that even think they might have it or hundreds of people in some cases."
2020-04-01,56:58,Donald Trump,"So you have to look at states. You have to give a little bit of flexibility. We have a state in the Midwest, or if Alaska as an example, doesn’t have a problem, it’s awfully tough to say close it down. So we have to have a little bit of flexibility. Look, we’re helping governors. We’re really here to help governors. They’re the front line of attack, and that includes in purchasing, by the way. We’re here, and we’re backing them up, and there’s never been a backup like we’ve given them. We’ve given them billions of dollars worth of things, medical supplies and ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators. We have thousands under construction right now. We have thousands ready to go in case they need it. There’s never been anything like this."
2020-04-01,57:43,Donald Trump,"They’ve done, really, the people, have done incredibly. We’re building hospitals all over the country. We’re building hospitals right now at a rate that has never even been contemplated before. They’re mobile hospitals, but they’re really not mobile. They’re incredible structures, but we’re building many hospitals. Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, we just finished a massive hospital complex. And we also have medical centers built in New York. We’re building hospitals at the rate that this country has never done before. And hopefully it’s all going to work out."
2020-04-01,58:20,Unnamed (Reporter),"Thank you sir. Mr. President, I just want to make sure we’re clear, on the planes. Are you looking at just curtailing routes between certain hotspots or is it broadly?"
2020-04-01,58:31,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at the whole thing because we’re getting into a position now where we want to do that, we have to do that, and so we’re looking at the whole thing and we may have some recommendations."
2020-04-01,58:41,Unnamed (Reporter),"My second question on economics, just with oil, oil prices are very low. The Saudis have increased production. I know that you’ve spoken about liking low oil prices, but then there’s also the industry aspect-"
2020-04-01,58:55,Donald Trump,"From 1950, these are oil prices. And that’s when they had big dollars. Big, beautiful dollars."
2020-04-01,59:00,Unnamed (Reporter),So do you advocate cuts? Do you advocate cuts to production? Do you…
2020-04-01,59:05,Donald Trump,"Look, we have a great oil industry, and the oil industry is being ravaged. And, as you know, Russia, and I spoke to President Putin, we had a great call, Russia, Saudi Arabia. I spoke with the Crown Prince. We had a great call. But I think that they will work it out over the next few days. If you ask me, I think it’s too simple not to be able to. They both know what they have to do. So I think I have confidence in both that they’ll be able to work it out."
2020-04-01,59:34,Donald Trump,"But it has ravaged an industry worldwide not here, I mean worldwide, the oil industry has been ravaged. So there was a lot of oil production to start off with, and then on top of it, it got hit with the virus, and business went down 35, 40% so that that business is a tough one. And they have ships all over the sea. I told you yesterday, all over the sea, massive tankers that they are using for storage. They go out, and they just sit there. There’s no place to go. They have massive amounts."
2020-04-01,01:00:07,Donald Trump,"Now gasoline is going to be 99 cents a gallon and less. You know that. That’s already starting. It’s popping up, 99 cents. So that’s like giving a massive tax cut to people of our country when. We try and get the airlines going, if fuel is costing much less, it helps with getting the airlines, which is always a tough business, always has been a tough business. But with that being said, look, I want to get that industry back where it was. We were doing records in that industry, also. We want to get it back to where it was. So I think that Saudi Arabia, Russia, they’re negotiating, they’re talking, and I think they’ll come up with something."
2020-04-01,01:00:46,Donald Trump,"I’m going to meet with the oil companies on Friday. I’m going to meet with the independent oil producers also on Friday or Saturday, maybe Sunday, but we’re having a lot of meetings on it. I think I know what to do to solve it, but if they’re unable to solve it, then I think I know what to do to solve it."
2020-04-01,01:01:06,Unnamed (Reporter),Can you give us a glimpse-
2020-04-01,01:01:07,Donald Trump,"We won’t mention it now, but it’s tough. I think I know what to do to solve it. We don’t want to lose our great oil companies. You know, we’re the number one producer of oil in the world, and a month ago when you said that it was great. Today when you say it, it’s not so meaningful. But I do believe there’s a way that that can be solved or pretty well solved. And I’d rather not do that."
2020-04-01,01:01:32,Donald Trump,"I think that Russia and Saudi Arabia, at some point, they’re going to make a deal in the not too distant future because it’s very bad for Russia. It’s very bad for Saudi Arabia. It’s very bad. I mean, it’s bad for both, so I think they’re going to make a deal. You know, the free market is a wonderful thing. It’s amazing how it could work, but I think they’re going to make a deal. Yeah, please. Over there."
2020-04-01,01:01:56,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, a couple of questions. One for you, one for Mr. Wolf, if possible. Over 5 million immigrants in this country do pay taxes through their ID numbers, yet they will not receive any money in their stimulus package, and no undocumented immigrant will receive any aid from the government during this crisis. How do you suppose they survive during the COVID-19?"
2020-04-01,01:02:19,Donald Trump,"Well, when you’re saying undocumented, meaning they came in illegally, and a lot of people would say we have a lot of citizens right now that won’t be working. So what are you going to do? It’s a tough thing. It’s a very terrible… It’s a very sad question. I must be honest with you. But they came in illegally, and we have a lot of people that are citizens of our country that won’t be able to have jobs. Now, I do think, once we get rid of the virus, I think we’re going to have a boom economy."
2020-04-01,01:02:48,Donald Trump,"I think it’s going to go up rather quickly, maybe very quickly and maybe slowly, but it’s going to go up and it’ll all come back. And I think it’s actually going to come back stronger than what it was because of the stimulus. But it’s a really a sad situation, and we are working on it. I will tell you, I’m not going to give you a hard and fast answer because I just want to tell you, it’s something I think about, and it’s something we’re working on. Please."
2020-04-01,01:03:16,Unnamed (Reporter),[crosstalk 01:03:16] Mr. Wolf?
2020-04-01,01:03:16,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-01,01:03:16,Unnamed (Reporter),"Thanks Mr. President. Question for Dr. Fauci. Looking beyond when we’re on the other side of this curve, are we looking at living with some sort of social distancing guidelines essentially until there’s treatment or a vaccine. For example, people looking forward to the summer talk about going to baseball games, going to concerts. We have political conventions over the summer. Are things like that possible or safe without a vaccine or a treatment in place?"
2020-04-01,01:03:44,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah, I think if we get to the part of the curve that Dr. Birx showed yesterday, when it goes down to essentially no new cases, no deaths at a period of time, I think it makes sense that you’re going to have to relax social distancing. The one thing we hopefully would have in place, and I believe we will have in place, is a much more robust system to be able to identify someone who’s infected, isolate them, and then do contact tracing."
2020-04-01,01:04:14,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Because if you have a really good program of containment that prevents you from ever having to get into mitigation… We’re in mitigation right now. That’s what the social and physical distancing is. The ultimate solution to a virus that might keep coming back would be a vaccine. In fact, I was on the weekly conference call with the WHO sponsored group of all the health leaders in the world who are dealing with this, and we all came to the agreement that we may have cycling with another season. We’ll be much better prepared. We likely will have interventions, but the ultimate game changer in this will be a vaccine, the same way a vaccine for other diseases, that were scourges in the past, that now we don’t even worry about."
2020-04-01,01:05:04,Unnamed (Reporter),[crosstalk 01:05:04] the vaccine?
2020-04-01,01:05:07,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The vaccine is, as I said, it’s on target. We’re still in Phase 1. There were three doses that we had to test. We’d been through the first two doses. We’re on the highest dose now. When we get that data, it’ll take a few months to get the data to feel confident to go to the Phase 2, and then a few months from now we’ll be in Phase 2. And I think we’re right on target for the year to a year and a half. ."
2020-04-01,01:05:29,Unnamed (Reporter),"If you don’t mind me asking, you and Dr. Birx, have either of you received threats of any kind or have you been given a security detail, given that you’ve been out here every day on camera speaking?"
2020-04-01,01:05:40,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, anything that has to do with security detail, I’d have to have you refer that question to the Inspector General of HHS rather than my answer to that."
2020-04-01,01:05:49,Unnamed (Reporter),Can you follow up on testing- [crosstalk 01:05:51]
2020-04-01,01:05:52,Donald Trump,He doesn’t need security. Everybody loves him.
2020-04-01,01:05:53,Unnamed (Reporter),Can you follow up on testing Dr. Fauci?
2020-04-01,01:05:55,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:05:55] says that they would be in big trouble if they ever attack. You know, he was a great basketball player. Did anybody know that? He was a little on the short side for the NBA, but he was talented. I read this, he won a game that was unwinnable against a great team, and his whole team said, “We can’t beat this team.” And he went in and they won the game, right? That was a couple of years ago."
2020-04-01,01:06:14,Dr. Anthony Fauci,A few years ago.
2020-04-01,01:06:15,Donald Trump,The head never changes. The attitude never changes.
2020-04-01,01:06:19,John (Reporter),Could I ask Dr. Fauci-
2020-04-01,01:06:21,Donald Trump,"Yes, please."
2020-04-01,01:06:21,John (Reporter),Because I know he loves being up behind the podium so much.
2020-04-01,01:06:23,Donald Trump,He does.
2020-04-01,01:06:24,John (Reporter),"Like pulling teeth but you don’t have the dentist. I don’t want to hit you with everything that’s coming along, but a lot of people who are watching television today heard from a researcher named Dr. Jacob Glanville who’s come up with a potential antibody therapy that he has given to you, [Samrid 00:12:38]. Just wanting to know if you know anything about this, what you might be able to tell people at home about it if you’ve seen it."
2020-04-01,01:06:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You know, John, I don’t know, specifically, this individual what they’re doing, but I can tell you there’s a lot of activity that is centered around a passive transfer of antibodies in the form of convalescent plasma, one. The number is to get immune globulin that you precipitate out of the plasma, and another is monoclonal antibody."
2020-04-01,01:07:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"It’s based on the same principle of, if you have a protective antibody, passive transfer of that could provide not only protection prophylactically but also treatment. This is an old concept. In fact, immunology was born decades and decades and decades ago with the concept of giving passive transfer of serum to an individual to protect them from an infection. So, I wouldn’t be surprised if he and a number of other people are pursuing this. It’s the right thing to do."
2020-04-01,01:07:35,Unnamed (Reporter),"Can I follow up on antibody testing please, Dr. Fauci? At what point can we as a country expect there to be a widespread antibody testing so we know exactly what we’re dealing with here, as well as other questions such as, when can people who are deemed to be healthy donate blood, for example."
2020-04-01,01:07:51,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Okay, so when you talk about antibody testing, there are a couple of things that you want to do. You want to find out if someone has been infected and whether or not they’re going to ultimately wind up being protected. Antibody testing, right now, is not the first thing on our priority. It’s something that we need to do is testing to see if someone is infected. It is very important ultimately to be able to get a feel for what the penetrance of the infection was in society for a number of reasons. You get a better feel of what the impact has been, but also you get a better feel of what the herd immunity would be. So I can foresee in the future that, when we get the facility, which we’ll have for sure… Ultimately, you can get a test that could do this reasonably easy, and do the kind of what we call sero-surveillance study."
2020-04-01,01:08:44,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"This is very analogous, that Dr. Birx and I were talking about that a lot, and that is, back in the day when and I were both doing the HIV AIDS issues, back when we first discovered the virus in ’83, and we had an antibody test in 1985. We found out, by serial surveillance representative in different populations, that we were dealing with the tip of the iceberg when we saw individuals who were the ones who actually got infected. It gave us a really good feel for how many people were infected, how many are doing well, and how many are getting ill. I foresee that we’ll have that same sort of information, which will be important information, but right now that’s not our immediate problem. [crosstalk 01:09:28]"
2020-04-01,01:09:31,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Let me just follow up with that because I think, as I discussed before, we had great… I just want to thank all the epidemiologist and scientists out there who worked with us over the last four weeks on models. Many came forward and really supported us. Right now we’re in talks with a whole series of universities. We have the most brilliant scientist in the world, in our universities in state after state, some of them public health universities, some of them basic science."
2020-04-01,01:10:01,Dr. Deborah Birx,"All of them have received NIH grants for HIV or other development of assays in the past. I’ve talked to a lot of them over the last few days to really ask them to develop these simple ELISA tests that could be used rapidly in their health care centers. Because immediately, it’s easy to do. We’ve all developed ELISA’s, so in a day or two, after development, they could screen their entire hospital. I think that would be very reassuring to the healthcare workers who have been on the front line. We worry about them every day. And so I’ve really called on every university and every state to develop ELISAs."
2020-04-01,01:10:40,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You can buy the antigens and the controls online and really work to test entire healthcare communities in your states and support them that way. At the same time, we worked on in sub-Saharan Africa on what we call dry blood spots. So we’re looking at, could you use that in a community while we work on the point of care tests, where you just dot blood onto this paper and then can go into the lab and be analyzed. That would allow us to look in nursing homes and other long term care facilities immediately."
2020-04-01,01:11:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And then finally we’ve reached out to the developers of the rapid test, the ones who developed it for malaria, the ones that developed them for HIV. It’s exactly the same concept and process to ask them to rapidly develop these tests because I think we owe it to the frontline healthcare providers, not only to provide them RNA test, but many of them have been on the front line now for four weeks, may have become exposed. We now know there’s asymptomatic. And, I think, really being able to tell them the peace of mind that would come from knowing you already were infected. You have antibody, you’re safe from reinfection 99.9% of the time."
2020-04-01,01:11:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,And so this I think would be very reassuring to our frontline healthcare workers. And our universities can do that by Friday. So I’m putting that challenge out to them to really work on that and do that. That’s what we did in the early days. We had a ELISA’s up and running within days of having the antigen. And so this is what’s really possible. So we’re not waiting. We’re asking for help now.
2020-04-01,01:12:17,Unnamed (Reporter),"So potentially this could happen soon, even within this month- [crosstalk 01:12:18]."
2020-04-01,01:12:20,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It could happen soon, within this month, if the university help us. Absolutely."
2020-04-01,01:12:25,Unnamed (Reporter),"[crosstalk 01:12:25] Mr. President, on Florida, Governor DeSantis says that he spoke with you before sharing his statement-"
2020-04-01,01:12:33,Donald Trump,He did. He spoke to me.
2020-04-01,01:12:34,Unnamed (Reporter),He has some loopholes in that-
2020-04-01,01:12:37,Donald Trump,That I don’t know. He spoke for me this morning.
2020-04-01,01:12:38,Unnamed (Reporter),"For religious events, for example, large religious groups can meet together and that doesn’t really-"
2020-04-01,01:12:44,Donald Trump,Who can?
2020-04-01,01:12:45,Unnamed (Reporter),Religious groups like church can meet.
2020-04-01,01:12:47,Donald Trump,"I didn’t speak to him about it, but he did speak to me this morning. We talked about. Please."
2020-04-01,01:12:51,Unnamed (Reporter),"[crosstalk 01:12:51] But your model has full mitigation, sir. Does that go against your model? Because that’s not full mitigation-"
2020-04-01,01:12:54,Donald Trump,I don’t know. It would have to look at what he did.
2020-04-01,01:12:55,Unnamed (Reporter),Back to the healthcare workers on the front lines. Following up with Dr. Birx as well. Hazard pay. You have said you have wanted that for the healthcare workers on the front lines. I know Secretary Mnuchin has mentioned something about that possibly-
2020-04-01,01:13:08,Donald Trump,I like it.
2020-04-01,01:13:08,Unnamed (Reporter),… In the fourth level of the stimulus package.
2020-04-01,01:13:09,Donald Trump,I like it.
2020-04-01,01:13:10,Unnamed (Reporter),But can you make it happen now? Do we have to wait for a fourth stimulus?
2020-04-01,01:13:14,Donald Trump,"Well, I think it’s something we’re discussing in terms of bonus or bonus pay. It doesn’t have to be called hazard pay. Could be called… Hey, look, I watched those people going to hospitals that I know. I talked about one of them, right? But I watched them walk into those hospitals, and they walk in, men, women, young, middle age, not so many older ones, and I watch them. They’re almost like… And I think I take the word almost out. They’re like warriors. They’re going in. People are cheering. Where there’s a building across the street, the people are screaming, they’re clapping. They’re like heroes."
2020-04-01,01:13:50,Unnamed (Reporter),[inaudible 01:13:50] going up the Empire State Building-
2020-04-01,01:13:52,Donald Trump,"No, no. I will tell you, I think it’s incredible. They’re like warriors. They like soldiers. And we’re going to be doing something for them, so whether it’s bonus because we’re hopefully going to be over this relatively quickly. It’s going to be vicious for a period of time, but hopefully we’re going to be over this. You have a lot of questions today. Look at you. Do you know this young lady behind you?"
2020-04-01,01:14:15,John (Reporter),Never met her before in my life.
2020-04-01,01:14:16,Unnamed (Reporter),We practicing social distancing.
2020-04-01,01:14:17,Donald Trump,That’s good. That’s a good idea.
2020-04-01,01:14:19,Unnamed (Reporter),It makes our marriage strong.
2020-04-01,01:14:20,Donald Trump,It’s good for a marriage.
2020-04-01,01:14:22,John (Reporter),"There are a lot of people who are worried about getting sick, and do they end up in a hospital? People who are uninsured and will they be crushed by medical bills. You were considering last month, it’s last month already, in March, reopening the healthcare.gov exchanges. There has been a determination not to do that. Could you tell us what the rationale was behind that decision, and what would you have as an alternative?"
2020-04-01,01:14:43,Donald Trump,"Okay. They took that up under the task force and make maybe Mike, do you want to say a few words about it."
2020-04-01,01:14:49,Mike Pence,"Well, thank you, Mr. President. And what I can tell you is that the President has made a priority from the outset of our task force work, make sure every American knows that they can have a coronavirus, and they don’t have to worry about the cost. We were very inspired as well. Because of the President’s engagement with the leading health insurance companies in the country that now, so far, two of the top health insurance companies in America have announced that they’re not only willing to waive copays on testing, now testing is fully covered because of the bill the President signed for every American. But also that these two insurance companies have waived copays on all coronavirus treatment."
2020-04-01,01:15:35,Mike Pence,"And I can assure you that as Congress and the President and the Administration begin to discuss the next piece of legislation, we’re going to make sure that Americans have those costs compensated and covered. Our priority right now is ensuring that every American takes the 30 days to slow the spread to heart. The best thing we can do for one another, for our family’s health, for the most vulnerable among us, is practice those mitigation strategies that the President outline yesterday for the next 30 days."
2020-04-01,01:16:14,Mike Pence,"We’re dealing with testing to make sure that every American can have a test that needs one. We’re dealing with supplies, and we’re making great progress in building personal protective equipment and ensuring that ventilators are available, particularly for the communities most impacted. But the American people can be confident that, as we move into this, we’re going to make sure that our health care workers are properly compensated for their extraordinary and courageous work. And we’ll make sure that the financial burden on those who end up contracting the coronavirus and dealing with its most serious symptoms also can deal with those issues and deal with those cost."
2020-04-01,01:16:58,John (Reporter),"Understood. Mr. Vice President, but there will be people who don’t have insurance who get sick before any of these mitigation efforts are put into place. And without opening the healthcare exchanges, where can they find insurance? People who aren’t insured by these companies that are covering the cost of the copay, where can people go now to get health insurance if they get before they get sick? Before they get sick?"
2020-04-01,01:17:20,Mike Pence,"Well, all across America we have Medicaid for underprivileged Americans, and at the President’s direction, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare services has given unprecedented waivers for states to expand coverage for coronavirus testing and treatment. We’ve also extended waivers for Medicare administration to make sure that people have access to that coverage. But we’re going to continue bring opportunities to the traditional systems of Medicaid in particular for the uninsured in America."
2020-04-01,01:17:52,John (Reporter),Can you expand that to cover middle-class?
2020-04-01,01:17:57,Mike Pence,"I think what we’re seeing health insurance companies do today, John, is really inspiring. I mean, one of the things [crosstalk 00:24:02] that has characterized the President’s approach here-"
2020-04-01,01:18:07,John (Reporter),That’s for people who already have insurance.
2020-04-01,01:18:09,Mike Pence,"Well, one of the things that has animated and characterize the President’s approach is the way he’s engaged American businesses to step up and do their part. And as the President said many times we’re inspired by the spirit of American businesses. I was at a distribution center for Walmart today in Southern Virginia, and I saw the way this company that, literally, has already hired thousands of people… These workers are coming to work. The truck drivers are coming to work, farmers are working in the field. Grocery stores made a commitment to the President a month ago that no grocery store in America would close down. The food supply is strong. We’re getting food on the table of every American, but it’s because the President went to these leaders and said, “We need you to step up and do your part.”"
2020-04-01,01:18:58,Mike Pence,"We engaged health insurance executives early on in this process to waive copays on Coronavirus testing, and because of the engagement, and, frankly, because of that patriotic and compassionate spirit that’s being reflected, we’ve already seen two of the largest insurance companies in the country announced that they’re providing full coverage, free of charge for coronavirus treatment."
2020-04-01,01:19:23,Mike Pence,"I fully expect, I think as the President does too, that we’ll see more of that for people that have insurance. We’ll continue to provide flexibility for Medicaid, for people that don’t have insurance. And we’ll make sure that Medicare has a flexibility to meet this moment. For seniors, when we remember that seniors with underlying health conditions are the most vulnerable to serious outcomes from the coronavirus, but we’ll get through this using the full weight of the federal government and the full strength of the American economy."
2020-04-01,01:19:52,Donald Trump,"John, I think it’s a very fair question, though, and it’s something we’re really going to look at because it doesn’t seem fair. If you have it, you have a big advantage and at a certain income level you do. I think it’s one of the greatest answers I’ve ever heard because Mike was able to speak for five minutes and not even touch your question. I said that’s what you call a great professional. Let me just tell you, it’s really a fair question, and it’s something we’re looking at."
2020-04-01,01:20:18,John (Reporter),"I mean, just in terms of a fair question or not, I always endeavored to ask fair questions, but this is a huge worry for people in this country who were in that donut hole. They don’t have commercial insurance. They don’t qualify for Medicaid. What do they do?"
2020-04-01,01:20:32,Donald Trump,It’s a certain group. And it’s a pretty big group. We’re looking at it.
2020-04-01,01:20:35,John (Reporter),"We spent the entire 2000 election talking about the donut hole, and it’s still there."
2020-04-01,01:20:41,Donald Trump,"I haven’t been up there yet. The other people have been talking about it, and they haven’t spoken to-"
2020-04-01,01:20:47,John (Reporter),This was 20 years ago when we’re talking about-
2020-04-01,01:20:48,Donald Trump,They’re talking about it-
2020-04-01,01:20:49,John (Reporter),[crosstalk 01:20:49] the donut hole.
2020-04-01,01:20:49,Donald Trump,"I know, but they’re talking about it in the 2020 election too, and nobody’s gotten to it. Nobody’s talked about it at all."
2020-04-01,01:20:57,John (Reporter),Mr. President-
2020-04-01,01:20:57,Donald Trump,I think we will. Yeah. I think we’re going to get to it. I think we’re going to get to it. I don’t think the other group will get to it. They haven’t even-
2020-04-01,01:21:03,Donald Trump,I don’t think the other group will get to it. They haven’t even spoken about it and it’s a big group of people.
2020-04-01,01:21:08,Unnamed (Reporter),Are you committing that there’s something [crosstalk 01:21:09].
2020-04-01,01:21:11,Donald Trump,"No, not committing but it’s something we’re going to look at. I can’t commit. I have to get approval from it. I have a thing called Congress, but it’s something we’re going to look at and we have been looking at it."
2020-04-01,01:21:19,Unnamed (Reporter),"You mentioned in this congressional bill, the next, the sort of phase four, you would like to see something there [crosstalk 01:21:24]."
2020-04-01,01:21:24,Donald Trump,"If there is a phase four, but we’re certainly looking at certain things. We want to help restaurants, entertainment. We want to help because it’s jobs. Not the restaurants, it’s jobs, tremendous amounts of jobs. So we’re looking at that. We’re looking at infrastructure. When you think of it, we will have spent $8 trillion and way back. We’re way pulled back, but we will have spent $8 trillion in the Middle East and yet our roads are in bad shape. Our bridges, our tunnels, bad shape. We’re going to be the talk of the world again soon, but we want two trillion. We will have spent in the Middle East and all we got out of it was death and cost. But all we got out of it was death. Millions of people. You have to look at the other side too. Millions and millions of people killed. Our great soldiers, thousands killed, so many wounded, hurt. Yet when we want to go and fix a road someplace, we want to do what we want to do in our country. It’s time that we spend money on our country. That’s what we’re going to do."
2020-04-01,01:22:29,Donald Trump,"It’s time that we start spending on our roads and our bridges and our schools, and all of the things that we’re supposed to be spending on. People are finally getting used to it. You could look at all of what we’ve done in the Middle East, way back in so many different places, way back in other countries too by the way. I’ve gone to other countries that are very rich. I said, I’m sorry, you’re going to have to reimburse us for our costs. They don’t even want to know what I’m talking about. It takes them 20 minutes to figure it out because nobody’s ever asked them to do that and they’re doing it. They’re doing it and they have no choice. They have to do it. So it’s time that we start spending on the USA. Please."
2020-04-01,01:23:09,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr President, this is a question for the vice president. On March 9th, you said one million tests had been delivered and another four million would be delivered by the end of the week. That clearly did not happen. What happened with those projections? What went wrong?"
2020-04-01,01:23:24,Mike Pence,"Well, I think the test kits were delivered according to HHS. But the difference is between receiving a test and the ability to rapidly produce a result of that test. Frankly because of the public private partnership that the president initiated now more than a month ago with our massive commercial laboratories across the country, our team was reported today that we’re now doing more than a hundred thousand tests a day. More than 1.2 million tests have been performed. States have established drive through sites all across the country. In fact, States have been so successful at the community based and drive through testing, that we’re working to transition over completely all of the federal work on drive through testing and have the States completely manage that process."
2020-04-01,01:24:16,Unnamed (Reporter),You’re saying four million tests were delivered by the end of that week?
2020-04-01,01:24:19,Mike Pence,"HHS was very busy from early in the year delivering test kits around the country. But the difference was, as the president said many times, we had an antiquated system where a state laboratory or CDC only had the capacity to process 40 to 60 tests a day. Now with the commercial labs, literally those labs are processing tens of thousands of tests every day. So while we’re continuing to distribute test kits around the country, now because of the partnership with companies like Roche, and Quest and Lab Corp, the American people are seeing the results of those tests more rapidly than at any point in the past. We expect that we’ll continue to expand. But the exciting news this weekend about Abbott Laboratories having a 15 minute test approved is going to put us in a position we believe down the road to get to where Dr [Fowchee 01:25:20] And Dr. [Burks 01:25:21] want us to be for many of the States that don’t yet have significant outbreak. There’s some 19 States where we don’t have significant outbreak, but we want to be doing the kind of surveillance testing in those States that will allow us to early on to identify people with the Coronavirus. Do what the experts call, contact tracing, and ensure that in that state we don’t have an outbreak of the Coronavirus."
2020-04-01,01:25:47,Donald Trump,"Many countries all over the world want to know whether or not they could use, especially our new test that was just developed by Abbott, which is almost instantaneous, which is going to be great. Remember this, we inherited. The word is we inherited bad tests, we literally inherited bad tests. These are horrible tests and it was broken. It was all broken and we fixed it. We’re doing millions of tests. Sometimes we send out a test and it’s not used. In many cases it wasn’t used, but we worked with the States and the testing has been pretty amazing. Especially considering the fact that we inherited a very broken system. Jeff."
2020-04-01,01:26:26,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, just a follow up on something you said before. Are you considering a temporary ban on all domestic flights?"
2020-04-01,01:26:33,Donald Trump,"I am looking at hotspots. I am looking where flights are going into hotspots. Some of those flights I didn’t like from the beginning, but closing up every single flight on every single airline, that’s a very, very, very rough decision. But we are thinking about hotspots where you go from spot to spot, both hot. We’ll let you know fairly soon."
2020-04-01,01:26:59,Unnamed (Reporter),What about rail travel?
2020-04-01,01:27:01,Donald Trump,"Similar thing. We have trains going back and forth. People don’t think of trains, but we do a lot of transportation business. It’s a very big decision to do that. We’re pretty late in the process from the standpoint that this is starting. You’re going to start seeing, I think over the next couple of weeks, you’re going to start to see us hit a top and start coming down. So we’ll make those decisions. Those are very, very big decisions from the standpoint of the future of our country in a way, in the future of our country. We have to get our country back. We have to start moving again. We have to start working again. They’re doing tests on airlines, very strong tests for getting on, getting off. They’re doing tests on trains, getting on, getting off. But when you start closing up entire transportation systems and then opening them up, that’s a very tough thing to do."
2020-04-01,01:27:56,Unnamed (Reporter),[crosstalk 01:27:56] There continues to be a lot of public confusion about the use of masks. What is the [crosstalk 01:28:03].
2020-04-01,01:28:03,Donald Trump,"The re use. I love the sterilization of the masks. Ohio Company, you can sterilize the N95. You can sterilize that mask for up to 20 times. Think of that, up to 20 times. We’re throwing them out and they’re very expensive masks. They’re throwing them out. I kept saying, one of the first questions I asked to Dr. Fowchee. I said, why aren’t they sterilized or cleaning the masks? Because it wasn’t my thing exactly when we first heard about this. Nobody else knew it either. Now we have a company and I guess a number of companies, one in Ohio, a great one that makes equipment where you can sterilize a mask up to 20 times, which is fantastic."
2020-04-01,01:28:47,Unnamed (Reporter),What about you or me? What about public? Should we be wearing masks out? We’ve heard lots of different recommendations.
2020-04-01,01:28:54,Donald Trump,"I don’t believe. Look, there’s a big thing. A lot of people don’t like it. Some people don’t like it because you’re taking it away from the medical professional. Some people don’t like it for other reasons. I don’t see where it hurts and it doesn’t have to be a mask. It can be a scarf. Scarf is highly recommended by the professionals. I don’t see where it hurts. I think frankly, if people wanted to do it, we don’t want to do anything that’s going to take masks. You’re talking about a tremendous amount of masks when you do that. We don’t want to take them away from our medical professionals, but I certainly don’t see it hurting. But what I do see people doing now is using scarves. I think in a certain way, depending on the fabric, I think in a certain way the scarf is better. It’s actually better."
2020-04-01,01:29:40,Unnamed (Reporter),Mr. President.
2020-04-01,01:29:41,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please. You [inaudible 01:29:37]."
2020-04-01,01:29:41,Unnamed (Reporter),"Thank you Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about social distancing and how it applies to religious organizations. Some churches, as you know, have continued to hold services even though you have advised people that they need to practice social distancing. There was a pastor of a mega church in Florida over the weekend who held services that were attended by several hundred people. So my question to you is, should pastors be holding services in the middle of this pandemic? Even if they do, should Americans be going to churches?"
2020-04-01,01:30:07,Donald Trump,"My biggest disappointment is that churches can’t meet in a time of need. This is really a great time for churches to be together, for people to get together on a Sunday or any day and meet. Yet, if you do that, if you do it close, you’re really giving this invisible enemy a very big advantage. So it’s the biggest, I think the single biggest disappointment. One of the reasons I said, wouldn’t it be great just to pick a date as I called it aspirational. An aspirational date would be Easter. I will tell you, it’s very, very disappointing. But again, you get too close and if somebody’s sick, you’re going to probably catch it. So you have to be very careful."
2020-04-01,01:30:50,Unnamed (Reporter),Just real quickly. Joe Biden’s campaign came out with a statement today saying that Biden …
2020-04-01,01:30:56,Donald Trump,[inaudible 01:30:55].
2020-04-01,01:30:56,Unnamed (Reporter),… would be [crosstalk 01:30:57].
2020-04-01,01:30:56,Donald Trump,Did he write the statement or get did PR person write it?
2020-04-01,01:31:00,Unnamed (Reporter),"As far as I know, the campaign was wide awake, sir. They sent out a statement that Joe Biden would be open …"
2020-04-01,01:31:05,Donald Trump,Good. [inaudible 01:31:03].
2020-04-01,01:31:05,Unnamed (Reporter),… to having a phone call with you to talk about the Coronavirus.
2020-04-01,01:31:07,Donald Trump,That’s okay. Sure.
2020-04-01,01:31:08,Unnamed (Reporter),Would you take his call?
2020-04-01,01:31:09,Donald Trump,Oh absolutely. I’d love to.
2020-04-01,01:31:10,Unnamed (Reporter),You would talk to him about it?
2020-04-01,01:31:13,Donald Trump,I’d love to speak to him too. I’d be in [inaudible 01:31:14]
2020-04-01,01:31:14,Unnamed (Reporter),How do you think you’d work together?
2020-04-01,01:31:16,Donald Trump,"I always found him to be a nice guy. I don’t know him very well, frankly, but I think he’s probably a nice guy. No, if he’d like to call it, I’d absolutely take his call. You can tell him."
2020-04-01,01:31:27,Unnamed (Reporter),But you have talked about the failings of the Obama Administration and leaving you with empty shelves and no plans. [crosstalk 00:01:31:33].
2020-04-01,01:31:37,Donald Trump,And no ammunition. Maybe no ammunition.
2020-04-01,01:31:37,Unnamed (Reporter),They got rid of the pandemic office and the national security council.
2020-04-01,01:31:39,Donald Trump,We didn’t do that. That turned out to be a false story. Now you’re starting to go.
2020-04-01,01:31:42,Unnamed (Reporter),"Oh, no, no, no, no."
2020-04-01,01:31:43,Donald Trump,"What are you working for, CNN?"
2020-04-01,01:31:44,Unnamed (Reporter),I’m pointing out what they have said and what you have said. That’s all.
2020-04-01,01:31:46,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 01:31:46] with Fox. Fox isn’t so easy either. Don’t kid yourself.
2020-04-01,01:31:50,Unnamed (Reporter),Mr. President [crosstalk 01:31:51]
2020-04-01,01:31:52,Donald Trump,"Look, John, let me tell you something. You know that’s a false story. What you just said is a false story. This doctor knows it better than anybody. No, but you shouldn’t be repeating a story that you know is false. All right. Who’s next? Please, go ahead in the back. You didn’t get one."
2020-04-01,01:32:08,Unnamed (Reporter),[inaudible 01:32:08] Iran is struggling with the virus …
2020-04-01,01:32:10,Donald Trump,It’s very sad what’s happening in Iran.
2020-04-01,01:32:11,Unnamed (Reporter),"A broken economy. Under which conditions would you consider suspending, say, US sanctions."
2020-04-01,01:32:18,Donald Trump,"Look, we have to talk to them. I think we could work out a deal with Iran very quickly. All they have to do is call. I just think that they’re proud people and the leadership is proud. They’re proud like all of us. We’re proud you. You people are proud. They’re having a hard time picking up the phone or they’re having a hard time setting up the meeting, but they could fix their country pretty easily. We don’t want hostility, but if they are hostile to us, they’re going to regret it like they’ve never regretted anything before, as per today’s statement. But all they have to do is call or have somebody call. There are channels where we can deal very easily. Again, I think that John Kerry did a tremendous disservice. I think he violated the Logan Act 100%. that’s what I think. I think it made it tough for them because they were dealing with them for years."
2020-04-01,01:33:11,Donald Trump,"It was a terrible deal. All of that money, $150 billion plus cash, plus cash, plane loads of cash, for a deal that was no good and was short term. Essentially it was a short term deal. Who makes a deal for that kind of money and $1.8 billion in cash? I don’t even know what that would look like. That would be this room would have to be filled up five times with hundred dollar bills. Who makes a deal like this? Then on top of it, the deal is no good. All right. How about one or two more?"
2020-04-01,01:33:43,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, Seattle police have reported a surge in calls about domestic violence. A number of groups have raised concern."
2020-04-01,01:33:50,Donald Trump,Mexican violence?
2020-04-01,01:33:51,Unnamed (Reporter),"Domestic violence. A number of groups have raised concerns that the longer people are stuck at home, the more domestic violence cases there are going to be. Do you share those concerns and what is being done to control [crosstalk 01:34:03]."
2020-04-01,01:34:01,Donald Trump,"It could be. It’s another cost of not getting our country working. Some people are getting along great. I’ve also had the exact opposite question. Families are coming together. They’re actually coming together. They haven’t talked for a long time and now all of a sudden they’re talking again, they’re loving each other. So I’ve heard that too, but I also have heard domestic violence at a higher level. And drug use because of, in this case, they’d lose their jobs. They had a great job, they had a great life, they have a great family. All of a sudden the husband’s told that he doesn’t have a job anymore and he’s got no money, and that brings drugs into it. That brings suicide into it. It’s a terrible thing. We have to get our country going again. We did the right thing. We had no choice. We did the right thing."
2020-04-01,01:34:54,Donald Trump,"Other countries tried to use the herd or the herd mentality. It’s just something that doesn’t work. Just to say, I heard Sweden gave it a shot and they saw things that were really frightening. They went immediately to shutting down the country. We did the right thing and we did it early. We did it early and we stopped other people from coming into our country early. But no, that’s a cost. I’ve been talking about that. People will say, what are you talking about? But you will have. You’ll have that. You’ll have domestic violence. You’ll have violence. You’ll have suicide. You’ll have drug addiction. A lot of people are going to be lost. We want to get this open as soon as we can. I mean, I’ll be the happiest person. So will you, everyone in this room happy when we get the word that this is the time. We have our common sense and they’ll give me a decision or they’ll be making certain statements. I think I’ll know how to interpret those statements very well. I’ll be with Mike, I’ll be with the task force. I’ll be with a lot of very talented people, including the two people on stage with us. But I look forward, that’ll be a great day. That’ll be a great day. All right. How about one more please?"
2020-04-01,01:36:07,Unnamed (Reporter),Can I ask a question of Mr. Wolf? Can I ask a question for Mr. Wolf?
2020-04-01,01:36:11,Donald Trump,Sure. [inaudible 01:36:13]
2020-04-01,01:36:16,Unnamed (Reporter),What is the current contingency planning [inaudible 01:36:19] detention centers where cases have COVID-19 are already popping up. Some people have been released. Is there a contingency plan? Would you release the most vulnerable people like children and the elder?
2020-04-01,01:36:31,Wolf,"Well ICE looks at on a case by case basis, even well before COVID, on looking at certain detention facilities and determine on a case by case basis if they do need to release individuals. When we do that, we often put them on alternatives to detention as well. In the case of COVID, we’re looking at vulnerable populations. Again, ICE is doing that in conjunction with CDC and other medical professionals. In some cases, we do need to do that for the health and safety, and the wellbeing of those detainees. But again, that’s a case by case basis. We’re not going to make any blanket statement that we’re going to release individuals of whole groups at a time. So it’s really important. I’ve said it twice now, it’s really a case by case basis determining the health of that particular population or detainee, the facility they’re in. Different facilities have different capabilities, whether it’s an ICE owned facility or it’s a contractor owned facility. So we’re certainly doing that. We’re doing that today. We’ve been doing that for the past several weeks."
2020-04-01,01:37:30,Unnamed (Reporter),Could you say how many have been released?
2020-04-01,01:37:32,Donald Trump,"While you’re up, could you talk about how tight that southern border is right now?"
2020-04-01,01:37:35,Wolf,"Absolutely. We continue to build miles of the wall every day. We’re up to over 150 I believe. We’re continuing to build new miles of wall. A lot of folks ask about a replacement wall or new miles. It’s a new capability on our Southwest border that we haven’t had before. So whether you talk to the agents, the border patrol agents, they like that capability, they like that impedance and denial that it provides them. It provides the ability for those agents to focus elsewhere on parts of the border that are very difficult to patrol. So we can use our resources in a different way. So we see a lot of benefits from the border wall system. Again, that includes not only the physical infrastructure, but the cameras, the roads, the lighting’s, the fiber optic cables. We’re looking forward and we’re still well on our track, well on our mark to meet 400, 450 miles by the end of the calendar year."
2020-04-01,01:38:31,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Wolf, can I get one more question from you while you’re here? There’s been concern among farmers about being able to get enough migrant labor to keep the food supply moving as we go into the harvest season. What are you doing to address that?"
2020-04-01,01:38:43,Wolf,"Well, at the direction of the vice president and the task force, we are looking at a number of different options with the H2A workers that you’ve mentioned. On how do we either extend the validity of their visa, or looking at a couple of different options. Nothing to announce here today. But again, at the direction of the president and the vice president, we’re looking at a variety of different options that I think we will have soon and it’d be very beneficial."
2020-04-01,01:39:06,Donald Trump,"But I am glad you asked that question because we want the farmers, they’ve had this for years. We want the farmers to be able to get the people that have been working those farms for years or we’re not going to have farms. So they’re going to come in and they’re going to be given a certain pass. We’re going to check them very, very closely, especially over the next month. Because remember after a month or so, I think once this passes, we’re not going to have to be hopefully worried too much about the virus, but we want them to come in. We’re not closing the border so that we can’t get any of those people to come. They’ve been there for years and years. I’ve given the commitment to the farmers they’re going to continue to come or we’re not going to have any farmers. One more question. Who are you with, by the way?"
2020-04-01,01:39:50,Unnamed (Reporter),I’m with Boys of American [inaudible 00:01:39:52].
2020-04-01,01:39:54,Donald Trump,"Boy, amazing. Who else please?"
2020-04-01,01:39:55,Unnamed (Reporter),"In less than 24 hours sir, two whips will arrive at Port Everglades with people who are infected with Coronavirus."
2020-04-01,01:39:59,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at the two ships. We have Canada notified, a lot of Canadians, a lot of British on the ship. They’re coming to take the people that are on the ship back to their homeland. Canada’s coming, UK is coming, and we have Americans. We have some people that are quite sick and we’re taking care of that. I’m speaking with the governor about that a lot and it’s a tough situation. It’s a tough situation. You can understand you have people that are sick on those ships. States don’t want to take, they have enough problems right now. They don’t want to take them, but we have to from a humane standpoint. We don’t have a choice. It’s like I don’t want to do that, but we have to. People are dying."
2020-04-01,01:40:47,Unnamed (Reporter),So they will be let into the country?
2020-04-01,01:40:48,Donald Trump,"We’re going to do something. We’re going to do something. At a minimum, we’re sending medical teams on board the ships. We’re taking the Canadians off and giving them to Canadian authorities. They’re going to bring them back home. The same thing with the UK, but we have to help the people. They’re in big trouble. No matter where, no matter where they’re from. Happened to be Americans, largely Americans. But whether they were or not, I mean they’re dying. So we have to do something. The governor knows that too."
2020-04-01,01:41:22,Unnamed (Reporter),[crosstalk 01:41:22] before being sent on.
2020-04-01,01:41:23,Donald Trump,"Well we’re sending a lot of them home. We’re sending a lot of them home to their countries, but we’ll be doing something and we’ll be announcing it. You’ll see what we’re doing. But we’re also putting medical staff onto the ships so that we can … we have to take care of the people."
2020-04-01,01:41:37,Unnamed (Reporter),At the risk of you getting chewed out again.
2020-04-01,01:41:39,Donald Trump,No you won’t actually. You know.
2020-04-01,01:41:41,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, the IRS is requiring people who don’t normally file income tax to file a simple income tax return in order to get their $1,200 check. Is that the way it’s going to be? Or is there something you can do to [crosstalk 01:41:55]."
2020-04-01,01:41:55,Donald Trump,"I had heard that. Now, I don’t know. Do you know that answer Mike?"
2020-04-01,01:41:57,Mike Pence,[inaudible 00:20:57].
2020-04-01,01:41:59,Unnamed (Reporter),IRS issued some guidance.
2020-04-01,01:42:00,Donald Trump,"It sounds like it. We could get back. It’s a process that they’re working on. We’ll get back to you as soon as we find out. All right, one more please."
2020-04-01,01:42:07,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, you spoke with President [inaudible 01:42:11] today. [crosstalk 01:42:11]"
2020-04-01,01:42:11,Donald Trump,I did. I spoke to him. He’s great. He’s a great guy and he’s doing a wonderful job from Brazil.
2020-04-01,01:42:18,Donald Trump,"Spoke to him this morning and just a very complimentary call. He’s working very hard. He’s got a problem with the virus, got a big problem. We talked about it today at length. We had a call this morning and Brazil is shut down as you know. They weren’t going to shut it down, but they had to. So Brazil is shut down. The world is shut down. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this. The entire world is shut down. You go from having the most powerful economy in the world and from other countries that are doing well, to being everything is shutdown. It’s very sad, but we’re going to get it going and we’re going to be stronger than ever. I really believe that. We’re going to be stronger. We’re going to have a big bounce, a very big bounce when this is gone. I just want to thank the American people. I want to thank these great professionals and I want to thank the media because really for the most part, the media has been very fair. Thank you very much everybody."
2020-04-01,01:43:12,Unnamed (Reporter),Thank you Mr. President.
2020-04-01,01:43:12,Unnamed (Reporter),Thank you Mr. President.
2020-04-02,01:08,Donald Trump,"Okay. Thank you very much. Good to be with you all. We’re in a very critical phase of our war against the coronavirus. It’s vital that every American follows our guidelines on the 30 days to slow the spread. The sacrifices we make over the next four weeks will have countless American lives saved. We’re going to save a lot of American lives. We’re in control of our own fate, very much so. Maintaining social distance, practicing vigorous hygiene and staying at home are your most effective ways to win the war and to escape danger."
2020-04-02,01:54,Donald Trump,"While you’re fighting this battle from home we’re working with the best scientists, doctors, and researchers anywhere in the world. We’re racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus as well as therapies, treatments, and ultimately a vaccine, and we’re making a lot of progress, I think medically a lot of progress."
2020-04-02,02:14,Donald Trump,"At the same time, we’re also racing to get relief to American workers and small businesses, as you know. I want to remind small business owners across America that the paycheck protection program is launching tomorrow. Nearly $350 billion in loans will be available to small businesses including sole proprietors. These loans are up to 100% forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers, got to take care of your workers."
2020-04-02,02:46,Donald Trump,"Furthermore, we want Social Security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return, they don’t have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to American citizens. The treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts, and don’t forget, I will always protect your Social Security, your Medicare and your Medicaid. We’re protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and I always will."
2020-04-02,03:18,Donald Trump,"I’d like now to invite SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza who is doing a fantastic job. She’s going to be very busy in the next little while and Secretary Steve Mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives and then we’ll get onto the attack of the virus itself and please if I might, Steve and Jovita."
2020-04-02,03:43,Jovita Carranza,"Thank you. Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, Secretary Mnuchin, Ivanka Trump and all who I have been working closely with in this effort."
2020-04-02,03:57,Jovita Carranza,Small business is the backbone of the American economy and the president has put the nation’s 30 million small businesses front and center in the response effort and we are working hard to get money to them quickly. This is an unprecedented effort by this administration to support small businesses and we know that there will be challenges in the process.
2020-04-02,04:22,Jovita Carranza,"Secretary Mnuchin and I are working in tandem to ensure that feedback from our partners is being heard and implemented. The private and public sector must work closely together to ensure that small businesses and their workers across the country are put first. This administration believes wholeheartedly that if you are a small business, you are a critical part of the economic fabric of this country and your viability is critical to the economic wellbeing of your employees."
2020-04-02,04:54,Jovita Carranza,"At SBA, we are working around the clock to support small businesses ensuring that we are prioritizing emergency capital for small businesses that are suffering economic harm as a result of this unprecedented situation. This relief will help stabilize a small business sector by providing businesses with the financial resources they need to keep their workers employed and keep up with their day-to-day operating expenses."
2020-04-02,05:24,Jovita Carranza,"Today I want to ensure that small businesses all over the country know about the paycheck protection program and how they can benefit from this. Simply put, the paycheck protection program is to help keep employees on payroll and small businesses open. SBA will forgive the portion of the loan that is used towards job retention and certain other expenses. We are working closely with lenders so that businesses can go directly to their local lenders. Paycheck protection program is in addition to substantial work that the SBA has and will continue to do to help small businesses including providing advances on SBA disaster loans and forgiving the existing SBA loan payments over the next six months."
2020-04-02,06:13,Jovita Carranza,"Additional details on these critically important programs can be found sba.gov and we will be updating these resources regularly. Our hearts go out to those affected by this terrible virus. Our communities around the country are stepping up and we will get through this together. At SBA, we know that every phone call, email, or application submitted has a small business owner, their employees and the communities they support around the other side. Our most important objective is to allow small businesses to keep their employees onboard and keep their businesses viable through this unprecedented disruption."
2020-04-02,06:57,Jovita Carranza,"I want to reiterate the importance of patience in this process as we work together to ensure that businesses are able to access needed credit. We will continue working around the clock as we’ve done with our federal and private sector partners, expanding capacity and working to make our systems as robust as possible to meet the needs. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-02,07:25,Steve Mnuchin,"Thank you Mr. President. Thank you Mr. Vice President. Thank you, Jovita. Mr. President, you’ve made clear to us we now need to execute. We need to get money to small business and American workers and that’s what we’re doing. The SBA and Treasury committed to get this program up and running tomorrow and when Jovita says people working around the clock, they literally, we had both teams working till four o’clock in the morning and start working again today. We’ve heard feedback from lenders, community banks, regional banks, and we’ve spent the last 24 hours making this system even easier."
2020-04-02,07:59,Steve Mnuchin,"So this will be up and running tomorrow. I encourage all small businesses that have 500 or fewer people, please contact your lenders. Any FDIC institution will be able to do this. Any credit union, existing SBA lenders and FinTech lenders. You get the money, you’ll get it the same day, you use this to pay your workers. Please bring your workers back to work. If you’ve let them go, you have eight weeks plus overhead. This is a very important program. I’m pleased to announce we are going to raise the interest rate on these loans and, again, the interest rate is paid for as part of the program. The borrower doesn’t have to pay this to 1%. We had announced it was going to be 50 basis points. We’ve heard from some smaller community banks that their deposit costs, even though the government’s borrowing at three or four basis points, this is on average a 90 loan, to make this attractive for community banks, we’ve agreed to raise the interest rate. Again, I encourage everybody take out the paycheck protection program."
2020-04-02,09:05,Steve Mnuchin,"I’m also pleased to report the economic impact payments. I had previously said this would take us three weeks. I’m pleased to report that within two weeks the first payments will be direct deposit into taxpayer’s account, and as the president said last night, the president authorized me to say that anybody that has social security recipients won’t need to file a new tax return and will have that. If we don’t have your direct deposit information, we’ll be putting up a web portal so that you can put that up. It is a very large priority. The president has made clear we want to get this money quickly into your hands."
2020-04-02,09:44,Steve Mnuchin,"I’m also pleased to report that we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve. We’re in the process of designing a new facility that we call the Main Street Lending Facility. We’re also looking at facilities for state governments as well. And I’m also pleased to report the employee retention credit. It’s up and running. The first $10,000 of wages, you get a 50% credit. That’s $5,000 per person. For everyone who’s kept someone, you can immediately get that money. You can deduct it from what you owe the IRS immediately. If you don’t know us money, you’ll get a refundable tax credit. So that is up and running. I’m also pleased to report we have the program up and running. We’re taking applications from the airlines, from the cargo companies and from national security companies. So thank you very much Mr. President."
2020-04-02,10:33,Donald Trump,"Thank you Steve. For Jovita or Steve, any questions?"
2020-04-02,10:35,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, Chase Bank sent a letter to its business clients today saying that they don’t have the necessary guidance from the SBA, from the Treasury Department to be able to accept loan applications starting tomorrow. The need is clearly enormous, but at least one major bank says they’re not fully empowered yet to be able to help there."
2020-04-02,10:55,Steve Mnuchin,"As I spoke to all the CEOs yesterday, I had a conference call with them. We got very good input from them on what they needed. As I said, people were working until four o’clock. I believe we just put up the federal register with the new guidelines for lenders. I’ve been assured that the banks will be in the process starting tomorrow. Now again, it’s going to take a little bit of time, but we committed that this will be available tomorrow and I encourage all companies, go to sba.com go to treasury.gov you can see the information you need immediately."
2020-04-02,11:26,Unnamed,"Just to follow up with the small business owners. A number of them saying that they were on that conference call and that there’s a tremendous power struggle going on between the Treasury and SBA and that it’s over process and forms, is what they tell me that, lenders are actually opting out because they can’t make enough money to even service the loans. So how are you going to make sure these small business owners get the capital they need to survive right now?"
2020-04-02,11:52,Steve Mnuchin,"First of all, I can assure you Jovita is here. Jovita used to work for me as the treasurer. There’s no power struggle. Jovita and our team, as I said, worked together until four o’clock in the morning, started working at seven o’clock again. We’ve made the form simpler and I can assure you at five points, I’ve told these bankers they should take older traders and put them in the branches. There’ll never be another opportunity to earn five points on a 90 day fully government guaranteed loan."
2020-04-02,12:20,Unnamed,And the checks right into direct deposit? IRS now saying it’d take four to five months. You’re saying two weeks-
2020-04-02,12:28,Steve Mnuchin,"Let me be clear. Let me be clear, I don’t know where you’re hearing these things. I told you this would be three weeks. I’m now committing to two weeks. We’re delivering on our commitments. The IRS, which I oversee, within two weeks the first money till be in people’s accounts."
2020-04-02,12:42,Unnamed,"The problem is not about the first checks for folks who have direct deposit. Sounds like those will go up pretty quickly. The question is then for folks who don’t have direct deposit, and there was a staff memo that was released by the House Ways and Means Committee today saying that that process could take up to five weeks. That takes you to mid-August. Is that how long it’s going to take?"
2020-04-02,12:59,Steve Mnuchin,"That is not going to take five… Again, let me just say, when Obama sent out these checks, it took months and months and months. I am assuring the American public they need the money now. What we’re going to do is, again, if we have your information, you’ll get it within two weeks. Social Security, you’ll get it very quickly after that. If we don’t have your information, you’ll have a simple web portal. You’ll upload it. If we don’t have that, we’ll send you checks in the mail."
2020-04-02,13:29,Unnamed,"How many checks can you process a week, though? How many checks can you…"
2020-04-02,13:29,Steve Mnuchin,"Again we can process a lot of checks, but we don’t want to send checks. In this environment, we don’t want people to get checks. We want to put money directly into their account."
2020-04-02,13:37,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary. This is for, I guess both you and the administrator. There’ve been some anecdotal reports that business people are trying to get access to the online site to submit the applications. The website’s been crashing. I’ve heard of webinars going offline because there’s just too many people on them, so how are you guys going to be ready tomorrow to get these loans out?"
2020-04-02,13:58,Steve Mnuchin,"We’ve brought in a lot of external resources at SBA and us to make sure there’s additional capacity. As I said, we heard a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process. It’s going to be up and running now. Let me just be clear. That doesn’t mean everybody is going to get their loan tomorrow, but the system will be up and running. We encourage people over the next week. Sign up. You can go on right now. You can go on the web, see what information you need. Very simple process."
2020-04-02,14:26,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, on a separate subject. Have you been in touch with Leader McConnell and Speaker Pelosi about their differences right now about another stimulus package?"
2020-04-02,14:37,Steve Mnuchin,"I’ve spoken to the leader. I’ve spoken to the Speaker. I’ve spoken to the president constantly. When the president’s ready and thinks we should do the next stage, we’re ready. The president’s talked about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign. I think you know that’s a big priority for him. Again, if we run out of money on the small business program, we’ll be back right away to Congress to get this increased."
2020-04-02,15:04,Unnamed,Does the unemployment numbers today increase the urgency of doing a Phase three?
2020-04-02,15:07,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, let me just say, we’re going through something that we’ve never done before where the government has shut down big parts of the economy because of health reasons. Our economy was in great shape. Our companies were in great shape. There are three ways that Americans are going to be protected. For small business, they’ll get paid by their business through this program, the direct deposit. There’s also enhanced unemployment. So we realize unfortunately there are a lot of companies that because they aren’t in business over a short period of time, again, we’re working with the states on enhanced unemployment and as soon as the medical professionals and the president give the all clear, we’re going to have a ton of liquidity. We have about $6 trillion. This has never been done between us and the Fed to put into the economy to support American workers and American business."
2020-04-02,15:59,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, in addition to the jobless numbers we saw today, phase three was signed before the social distancing guidelines were extended for another month. So what additional relief are you going to give to Americans as they stay out of work for all these extra weeks? What are you waiting for?"
2020-04-02,16:20,Steve Mnuchin,"In designing this program, we thought that we had liquidity for about 10 weeks, and that’s what we’ve designed. And again, I think the president’s been very clear. If we need to go back to Congress to support the American economy and American workers, we will be doing that."
2020-04-02,16:37,Unnamed,"Secretary Mnuchin, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has formed a select committee to oversee the distribution of recovery funds and she says she wants to make sure that those funds are wisely and efficiently spent. Do you think that select committee is something that’s necessary?"
2020-04-02,16:52,Steve Mnuchin,"I don’t. Both parties wanted us to have oversight, wanted us to have transparency. We have full transparency. We have an oversight committee that the speaker gets to pick someone, the leader gets to pick someone. I believe there’s five people on it. And again, that that committee will review the money that we’re spending. And again, we support full transparency. Taxpayers should understand how we’re going to support this economy and jobs."
2020-04-02,17:19,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary. Senator Murkowski has asked you to consider providing loans to energy companies under the Cares Act, the phase three bill. What are your thoughts on that? Would you consider providing those loans to energy companies."
2020-04-02,17:33,Steve Mnuchin,"So thank you and let me clarify. I have very limited ability to do direct loans out of the Treasury. I can do them for passenger airlines, cargo airlines, contractors and national security companies. Outside of that, we work with the Federal Reserve to create broad-based lending facilities, which we will do. So our expectation is the energy companies like all our other companies will be able to participate in broad based facilities, whether it’s the corporate facility or whether it’s the Main Street facility, but not direct lending out of the treasury."
2020-04-02,18:09,Unnamed,"A question for clarity about the direct payments to Americans. For those folks who don’t have bank accounts, who don’t have direct deposit information on file with the IRS, how long would they have to wait for their check?"
2020-04-02,18:20,Steve Mnuchin,"For people who don’t have direct deposit, again we’ll have an easy way they put it up. We can on a rolling basis, I think, within a couple of days when they give it to us, we’ll send the money out. We do realize there are people who are under-banked. And again we’re working with all the digital companies, prepaid debit cards. We’re working with all of them to make sure we have a process that every American gets their money quickly. This money does people no good if it shows up in four months and we will deliver on that promise."
2020-04-02,18:48,Unnamed,"So quickly is a matter of weeks then perhaps, not months?"
2020-04-02,18:50,Steve Mnuchin,Quickly as a matter of weeks and not months. That’s correct.
2020-04-02,18:56,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, one area where you can make direct loans is to the airlines. How much do you expect that the treasury department and the federal government will be involved in overseeing the operations of airlines as it pertains to which routes get cut back, how much they operate, what they do about their employees and the like?"
2020-04-02,19:17,Steve Mnuchin,"So there are very strict requirements that’s built into the bill. Again, this was a bipartisan requirement. One, anything we do with the airlines, they have to maintain substantially all of their employees. So again, any money that we provide them will go to pay their employees. We’re going to be working with the Secretary of Transportation. There are requirements to maintain certain routes. So again, we have a very clear process. We’ve hired three outside advisors, will be financial advisors and three law firms. We’ll be releasing that information shortly. And I want to thank them. They’re all working for basically very, very little money. They couldn’t work for free so they’ve agreed to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organizations. So again, no big fees to bankers. We’ve got a great team of three lawyers and three financial advisors that will assist us."
2020-04-02,20:07,Unnamed,"Just to follow up on that, will you give us a list of the names of those people who are advising you when you release the information?"
2020-04-02,20:14,Steve Mnuchin,Of course we will. We’ll give you the names as well as the contracts.
2020-04-02,20:19,Unnamed,Any names right now other than Black Rock?
2020-04-02,20:20,Steve Mnuchin,"So again, I’m happy to announce we have the PJT Partners is going to do the passenger airlines, Moelis and Company is going to do the cargo and contractors, and Perella Weinberg will handle the national security. And there’ll be three law firms which we’ll announce shortly that will be working in each one of those sectors. And again, let me just be clear, we need to get this done quickly. The airlines need money. We’re going to work very closely with the Department of Transportation and get this done quickly. We’ve actually already received contracts from a lot of the people. Again, there’s guidance up on the web. Full transparency. We’ve asked for applications."
2020-04-02,20:59,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, on the airline issue again, Speaker Pelosi and others have said that the government taking stakes in those airlines should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically. What’s your response to that?"
2020-04-02,21:14,Steve Mnuchin,"I spoke to the Speaker last night about that. This was something that was highly negotiated between the Republicans and the Democrats. The president was personally involved in this. He was on the phone with us many times. Mitch McConnell, Mark Meadows, senators on both sides. There is a specific line in the bill that says that the Secretary, meaning me, will determine proper compensation, so this is not a bail out for the airlines and I will be working, once we get our advice from our financial advisors, we get the applications from the airlines. I’ll be working very closely with the president and we’ll make sure that we strike the right balance. Not a bail out. Taxpayers get compensated. But these airlines, these are national security issues. We want to keep our airlines intact."
2020-04-02,22:01,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, just more broadly perhaps for the administrator if not for you as well. Some small businesses, restaurant owners for example are finding that laying off their employees so that they can start collecting unemployment is better both for them as business owners and for their workers. What incentives do they have right now to keep their employees on the payroll if no one’s coming into their restaurant?"
2020-04-02,22:26,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, the incentive that you have, and we want American business to be kept intact. The incentive is these are loans that turn into grants. So if you’re a business owner and you’re a restaurant, you can hire your people back. You get money for their medical, you keep them on the medical plan, you get money for your rent, you get money for your electricity, so you’re motivated. We want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it’s appropriate. So this doesn’t cost the business owners anything."
2020-04-02,22:57,Steve Mnuchin,"When people talk about it, I can’t imagine any American worker who had a job, is offered to keep their job isn’t going to want to have it. And let me just be clear, we’ve also talked about this unemployment issue. You can only get unemployment if you don’t have a job. So unemployment is intended for those people that are some of the mid-size or larger businesses and we’re very sympathetic to this, that these companies can’t afford, and for those people, the enhanced unemployment will be a significant benefit."
2020-04-02,23:28,Steve Mnuchin,"But we want to make sure 50% of the American workforce is small businesses under 500 people. The president, the vice president, the administrator and I want to make sure this part of the economy is ready and intact when we’re ready to reopen."
2020-04-02,23:43,Unnamed,"A question for the administrator. Is there a certain category of small businesses that you’re most concerned about? Restaurants, hair salons, things like that?"
2020-04-02,23:52,Jovita Carranza,"That’s a great question. We’re concerned about every small business. There’s 30 million small businesses that we’re really focused on and we’re working feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available funds to them as quickly as possible. So it’s 30 million small businesses and the other businesses are being dealt with with the PPP, with the paycheck protection. There was also the disaster, what call the economic injury disaster loans. And then there was an advance associated with that particular program as well."
2020-04-02,24:23,Jovita Carranza,"So to answer your question, we’re concerned about all businesses, and as the secretary indicated, we’re looking at employees being ready, not lost in this process. We want businesses to stay intact because they represent how half the GDP. So if we spend a trillion to support 10 trillion or 11 trillion, I think that’s a significant investment and that’s what we’re focused on."
2020-04-02,24:50,Unnamed,Is there a certain segment that you think is particularly vulnerable?
2020-04-02,24:54,Steve Mnuchin,"Hang on, I just want to make one comment for explanation because I want to make sure everybody out there understands this. If you’re an independent contractor, if you’re a sole proprietor, you’re eligible for this as well. Now that program won’t be up and running until next week. But again, this is a very broad definition of small business. So if you’re an independent plumber, if you’re an independent contractor, you’re covered under this program. Slightly more complicated, you have to come into your bank and give them more information. But starting next week that part of the program will be up and running. Also charities, charities as well. Very important. The vice president and president make sure that we covered small charities in this."
2020-04-02,25:35,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:25:35] churches and religious nonprofits.
2020-04-02,25:38,Steve Mnuchin,"It does, although there are some technical issues, but yes, it does include faith organizations."
2020-04-02,25:45,Unnamed,Is that under the SBA program?
2020-04-02,25:47,Steve Mnuchin,"This is under the PPP yes, the new SBA program. They are covered. Thank you everybody."
2020-04-02,25:54,Donald Trump,Thank you all.
2020-04-02,25:54,Steve Mnuchin,Thank you everybody.
2020-04-02,25:54,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Steve. Good job. Thank you. Okay, so that begins right away and they start handing out checks, and a lot of people are going to have their businesses built back up quickly I hope. And we’ll see it. Complicated big small businesses, actually big business. So I thank them both. And please, we have some great gentlemen. Let me see, great gentlemen. That’s correct. Thank you very much."
2020-04-02,26:26,Donald Trump,"Today, my administration is also issuing new guidelines to protect elderly Americans who remain the most vulnerable. By now, nursing homes should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel. Today we’re further recommending that all nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread, and we’re also urging facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents. And this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future long after the enemy has gone, this particular enemy is gone."
2020-04-02,27:07,Donald Trump,"We’re also making every effort to provide relief to our great veterans. We take very good care of our veterans. At my direction Secretary Wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefits and to postpone debt collections. We’re now conducting well over 100,000 coronavirus tests per day. It’s over 100,000 tests a day, and these are accurate tests and they’re moving rapidly, which is more than any other country in the world, both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis the most."
2020-04-02,27:47,Donald Trump,"The FDA has also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed a body Cellex, a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system. Moments ago I directed Secretary Azar, and acting Secretary Wolf to use any and all available authority under the Defense Production Act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supplies they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe cases of C-O-V-I-D-19. You know what that is, right? Become a very famous term C-O-V-I-D. COVID."
2020-04-02,28:29,Donald Trump,"This action will help General Electric Hill-Rom, Medtronic, Resmed, Royal Phillips, and Vyaire Medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators. We have over 100,000 being built right now or soon to be started. We anticipate issuing more orders under the Defense Production Act in the very near future. In addition to the one that I’ve just signed against 3M for face masks, we just signed an element of the act against 3M and hopefully they’ll be able to do what they are supposed to do."
2020-04-02,29:15,Donald Trump,"Just spoke to Mary Barra of General Motors and she said they’re very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilators. They have a lot of ventilators that they’ve committed to build, and they’ll be starting very, very quickly. FEMA continues to deliver resources to areas most effected by the virus, including New York. On top of the 3,000 beds we’re already providing to the Javits Center, the Department of Defense is adding another 48 ICU beds."
2020-04-02,29:44,Donald Trump,"Governor Cuomo has asked that this facility go and it’s a big beautiful facility. It’d be converted to a COVID hospital and we hadn’t done that yet. We hadn’t thought in terms of doing that, but their use is, their real demand is for that. And we had meetings on it with the task force. We had meetings with the military and I’ve decided to say, yes, I’m going to do that. That I will be signing and agreeing to a yes answer so that we will be doing that and also we will be staffing it so the federal government is doing a lot of things that wasn’t anticipated that it do. This is a 2,500 and/or 2,900, can easily be set up, hospital built in Javits Center. And so we’re going to be converting that to a COVID-19 hospital and it’s going to be a staffed by the military and by the federal government."
2020-04-02,30:52,Donald Trump,"And based on the fact that I agreed to that, we had two other facilities that will likewise asking for it and that would be in Louisiana and also in Dallas and we’ll be doing those. We spoke to the governor of Louisiana, spoke to the governor of Texas, and we’ve told them that we will be staffing those hospitals again above and beyond, but that’s okay. We have to do that. In addition to USNS Comfort is docked in New York to accept patients that is non-COVID."
2020-04-02,31:27,Donald Trump,"To date FEMA has delivered more than 4 million N95 mask respirators. Think of that, 4 million, 4 million. Don’t forget we’re a secondary source. The states are doing it and we’re backing them up, but we’ve gotten 4 million N95 respirators, 1.8 million surgical masks, 460,000 face shields, 1.4 million gloves and 4,400 ventilators just to the city and to the State of New York and some of them now are being sent. I spoke with both the Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio a little while ago and some of them are being sent to the city."
2020-04-02,32:11,Donald Trump,"All of America stands with the people of New York in this time of need. It’s definitely a hot spot, but we have other hotspots also and we’re taking care of them very, very strongly, very powerfully. We have the finest people in the world in those locations and I think the federal government has not only acted early but acted quickly, professionally. There’s no people like this. Doctors, nurses, first responders and other healthcare providers who want to help New York at this critical time should visit website, nyc.gov/helpnow. Nyc.gov/helpnow. they need help now. They need people to help them."
2020-04-02,32:56,Donald Trump,"We have great facilities and we’ve built some brand new facilities, big ones, but we need help. We need help for professional people. So if you’re in an area that isn’t so affected, and you’re a doctor, a nurse, a health care worker, please get to that website and we would really appreciate your help. New York city needs it. Louisiana, by the way, needs it. Michigan needs it. Whatever you can do, those are very strong hotspots. They need help."
2020-04-02,33:25,Donald Trump,"In recent weeks, as the virus has spread and economic hardship has followed, we have seen Americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion. I want to remind everyone here in our nation’s capital, especially in Congress, that this is not the time for politics, endless partisan investigations. Here we go again. I’ve already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years. You see what happens. It’s a witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt and in the end the people doing the witch hunt have been losing and they’ve been losing by a lot, and it’s not any time for witch hunts, it’s time to get this enemy defeated. Conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resources, time, attention, and we want to fight for American lives, not waste time and build up my poll numbers cause that’s all they’re doing. Because everyone knows it’s ridiculous."
2020-04-02,34:29,Donald Trump,"So we want to focus on the people of this country, even the people of the world, we’re going to be able to help them because right now, as an example, we’re building so many ventilators, very, very hard to build, but we’re building thousands, thousands of them and a lot of them will be coming at a time where we won’t need them as badly because it takes time. Very complex, very expensive. And we’ll be able to help outside of our country. We think we’ll be able to help. That’s something that you cannot easily produce. As citizens we’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love, loyalty, and affection."
2020-04-02,35:03,Donald Trump,"We’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love, loyalty, and affection. There’s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stirs in our hearts. And that is so true."
2020-04-02,35:10,Donald Trump,"It’s incredible the job that everybody’s been doing. Everybody. They don’t sleep. They don’t go to bed. Sometimes they get nothing. Said to somebody recently on the task force, how many hours sleep have you gotten over the last couple of days? The answer was none. None."
2020-04-02,35:28,Donald Trump,In one Massachusetts neighborhood citizens come out of their homes each night at eight o’clock from their porches and they sing God Bless America. Others have joined in spreading from house to house down one street up to the next until their little town with a spirit of patriotism and reminding all Americans that we’re all in this together. We’ll fight together and we will win together. We’re going to win this.
2020-04-02,35:53,Donald Trump,Now what I’d like to do is I’m going to step out.
2020-04-02,35:56,Donald Trump,"We have a meeting on the subject and I’m going to step out just for a few moments. I’ll be right back. We’ll answer some questions. But you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job led by Vice President Mike Pence, head of the task force. And then Jared Kushner is going to say a few words and Admiral [Polowczyk 00:01:17], Peter Navarro, Dr. Birx and myself."
2020-04-02,36:21,Donald Trump,"I’ll be right back. So I’ll see you in a little while. I did take a test. It just came out. This is from the white house physician. It just came out. I just took it this morning. And I took it. It took me literally a minute to take it and it took me, I guess it was 14 or 15 minutes. I went to work. I didn’t wait for it, but he said it took 14 minutes or something to come up with a conclusion and it said the President tested negative for COVID 19."
2020-04-02,36:52,Donald Trump,"So that’s the second one. I think I took it really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked and it’s a lot easier. I’ve done them both. And the second one is much more pleasant, Jeff, I can tell you that. Much more pleasant."
2020-04-02,37:04,Donald Trump,So I’ll be back in a little while and Mike please take over. Thank you. Thank you all very much. I’ll be right back.
2020-04-02,37:14,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but earlier in the day the President convened all the key elements of our supply chain team in the oval office for an update on the progress that we’ve been making working literally around the clock to make sure that our healthcare workers, the people on the front lines have the personal protective equipment and also the ventilators to be able to meet this moment. And today you’re going to hear from the people that are literally working. Working each and every day to make that happen."
2020-04-02,37:54,Mike Pence,"Dr Deborah Birx is also with us. She’ll reflect in a few moments on the progress that we’re making analyzing the data. Each and every day we’re looking county by county, state by state consulting with governors and local health officials."
2020-04-02,38:12,Mike Pence,"At the present moment more than 1.3 million tests have been performed, and as you all are aware, some 236,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus. With now the losses over 5,000 Americans and our hearts are with their families. Beyond that, we have been focusing not just on ensuring the testing is occurring, but that the supplies are flowing. As the President just announced, he made a decision today to deploy thousands of N95 masks directly to New York city’s public hospitals. And our team will speak about that in just a moment."
2020-04-02,38:51,Mike Pence,"And also the President took the unprecedented step to direct the department of defense to use military healthcare personnel to operate all COVID facilities at the Javits Center in New York, at the convention center in New Orleans and at the convention center in Dallas. And we’ve informed each of the governors of those States today that their requests, we were making those military medical personnel available to operate in all COVID facility."
2020-04-02,39:23,Mike Pence,"But we would emphasize to people in that community who believe you’ve been impacted or have contracted to coronavirus contact your local healthcare provider. We anticipate in the New York area that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you are transferred to the Javits center. And in all cases, simply look to the guidance of your local governors about how best to receive the care that every American is entitled to have."
2020-04-02,39:55,Mike Pence,"Beyond that, let me say that we have been working through FEMA’s acquisition process, not only to deploy but to gather up personal protective equipment. And in just a few moments you will hear from Admiral John Polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have made in deploying not just the strategic national stockpile, but also in identifying on the commercial marketplace around America and around the world literally millions of N95 masks, surgical gowns, gloves, protective equipment. And at this point we’ve distributed some 7,600 ventilators. And you’ll hear today specifically about the States that have received those ventilators."
2020-04-02,40:43,Mike Pence,This team is truly acted in an inspiring way. And literally is working with dozens and dozens of people at the FEMA stabilization task force to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned to find the supplies we need.
2020-04-02,40:58,Mike Pence,"Let me also say today you’re going to hear from Jared Kushner, a Senior Advisor to the President of the United States, but someone that the White House Coronavirus Task Force directed to work with FEMA on supply chain issues. And in recent weeks he’s been leading a working group in conjunction with FEMA that literally has identified millions of medical supplies around the nation, and around the world, and we’re grateful for his efforts and his leadership. Finally, you’ll hear from Peter Navarro who will explain the action the President took today using the Defense Production Act."
2020-04-02,41:37,Mike Pence,"But as you hear details today about medical supplies that have been distributed, those that have been purchased, those that we’re making available ventilators distributed to hospitals and those that are available, let me just remind every American that you can make a difference in ensuring that every patient has the treatment that they deserve. Every healthcare provider, every doctor and nurse and nurse’s assistant has the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to have by putting into practice, the President’s 30 days To Slow The Spread. I mean we want you to take to heart the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America."
2020-04-02,42:20,Mike Pence,"First, to protect your own health, to protect the health of your family, to protect the health of your community. We know so many people are asymptomatic. And people that literally don’t know they have the Coronavirus but have the ability to infect others. We want you to put these guidelines into practice. Social distancing, using a drive through at a restaurant, washing your hands on a regular basis."
2020-04-02,42:42,Mike Pence,"But as we focus today on supplies, make no mistake about it. Every American can make sure that our health care workers and more importantly Americans that are struggling with Corona virus have the equipment to support their treatment by putting these principles into practice. Because the fewer Americans that contract the Coronavirus, the fewer Americans will have to enter our healthcare system. And that’ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy."
2020-04-02,43:12,Mike Pence,"So we thank the millions of Americans who’ve responded in the first two days of 30 Days To Slow The Spread. And I’m just absolutely confident that in the days ahead, every American’s going to do their part for your health, your family’s health, the health of your community, and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world."
2020-04-02,43:33,Mike Pence,"With that, let me introduce a Jared Kushner to speak about the work that he’s been doing, working with FEMA on ensuring a strong supply chain to meet this moment. Jared."
2020-04-02,43:47,Jared Kushner,Thank you Mr. Vice President. And thank you for your great leadership on the task force. And thank you to Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci as well. It’s been an honor working with you these past few weeks.
2020-04-02,43:57,Jared Kushner,"When the Vice President first asked me to help on the task force with different tasks, I asked the President what he expected from the task force and how I can best serve him in the task force. What the President asked is that all of the recommendations that we make be based on data. He wanted us to be very rigorous to make sure that we were studying the data, collecting data. A lot of things in this country were happening very quickly and we want to make sure that we were trying to keep updating our models and making sure that we were making informed decisions and informed recommendations to him based on the data that we were able to collect and put together."
2020-04-02,44:29,Jared Kushner,The President wanted to make sure that we had the best people doing the best jobs and making sure that we had the right people focused on all the things that needed to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual times for the American people.
2020-04-02,44:42,Jared Kushner,The President also instructed me to make sure that I break down every barrier needed to make sure that the teams can succeed. This is an effort where the government is doing things that the government doesn’t normally do. We’re stretching. We’re acting very quickly and the President wants to make sure that the white house is fully behind the different people running the different lines of effort to make sure that we get everything done in a speed that the President demands.
2020-04-02,45:06,Jared Kushner,The President also wanted us to make sure we think outside the box. Make sure we’re finding all the best thinkers in the country. Making sure we’re getting all the best ideas and that we’re doing everything possible to make sure that we can keep Americans safe. And make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible and balance all the different aspects that need to be thought of while we do this.
2020-04-02,45:26,Jared Kushner,"This truly is a historic challenge. We have not seen something like this in a very, very long time. But I am very confident that by bringing innovative solutions to these hard problems we will make progress."
2020-04-02,45:39,Jared Kushner,"Today we were briefing the President earlier he asked me to come out and talk a little bit about what we are doing on the supply chain task force which Admiral Polowczyk has been leading and what he’s been very impressed by is the way that we’ve been resourceful to find product all over the world, all over the country. And we are finding ways to solve the different problems."
2020-04-02,45:57,Jared Kushner,"The President’s been very, very hands on in this. He’s really instructed us to leave no stone unturned. Just very early this morning, I got a call from the President. He told me he was hearing from friends of his in New York that the New York Public Hospital System was running low on critical supply. He instructed me this morning, I called Dr Katz who runs the system."
2020-04-02,46:17,Jared Kushner,I asked him which supply was the most supply he was nervous about. He told me it was the N95 masks. I asked what his daily burn was and I basically got that number. Called up Admiral Polowczyk. Made sure that we had the inventory. We went to the President today and earlier today the President called Mayor de Blasio to inform him that we were going to send a month of supply to New York Public Hospital System to make sure that the workers on the front line can rest assured that they have the N95 masks that they need to get through the next month. We’ll be doing similar things with all the different public hospitals that are in the hotspot zones and making sure that we’re constantly in communications with the local communities.
2020-04-02,46:56,Jared Kushner,"One thing I will say just based on data is that we’ve been getting a lot of data from different governors and from different mayors and from different cities. One thing I’ve seen FEMA do very, very well over the last week or so is now we’re getting real time data from a lot of cities. People who have requests for different products and supplies. A lot of them are doing it based on projections, which are not the realistic projections. The projections change every day as we see the cases, as we see the impacts of The Stop Spread effort that this task force recommended and the President has been pushing forward."
2020-04-02,47:28,Jared Kushner,So I do think that we’ll see that hopefully there’ll be impact of that and the task force has been working very hard through the FEMA group with Admiral Polowczyk to make sure that we’re getting the supplies to people before they run out and making sure that we’re doing it in a proper way.
2020-04-02,47:43,Jared Kushner,"I’d like to just introduce Admiral Polowczyk who before coming to this I guess still is, he’s the Vice Director For Logistics for the Joint Staff. I got a call from one of the senators saying, well, why don’t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the Defense Production Act? And I said, well, the President already did that. This is the best man that we have in the country for supplies and logistics. He joined the task force 13 days ago over at FEMA and he’s built a team really at the direction of the Vice President that includes people from FEMA, OMB, the FDA, HHS, The White House, and from everywhere else."
2020-04-02,48:17,Jared Kushner,"And what they’ve done over the last 13 days has been really extraordinary. We’ve done things that the government has never done before, quicker than they’ve ever done it before. And what we’re seeing now is we found a lot of supplies in the country. We’ve been distributing them where we anticipate there will be needs and also trying to make sure that we’re hitting places where there are needs."
2020-04-02,48:33,Jared Kushner,"So I can tell you the people in the task force, they’re working day and night. You’ve got a lot of people in the government. We recognize the challenge that America faces right now. We know what a lot of the people on the front lines are facing, the fear that they had that they won’t have the supplies they need. And our goal is to work as hard as we can to make sure that we don’t let them down."
2020-04-02,48:52,Jared Kushner,So I just want to thank everybody and with that I’ll introduce Admiral Polowczyk who’s doing an amazing job.
2020-04-02,49:00,John Polowczyk,"Thank you Mr. Kushner, Mr. Vice President. So today I’m going to cover a couple items. A couple of five things."
2020-04-02,49:08,John Polowczyk,"First thing I want to talk about is resources pushed out from the federal government. And then I’m going to talk about this Air Bridge, which you may have heard about. I’m going to talk about data as you said, Mr. Kushner is absolutely right. We’re trying to be data driven. And then I’m going to talk a little bit about how we’re trying to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge."
2020-04-02,49:36,John Polowczyk,"So the first thing I want to talk about is surgical masks. So you’ve quickly stated numbers here. So I’m about to go through several different slides to give you just scale and magnitude federal resources that have been applied at the problem. So 27.1 million surgical masks pushed out to state governments. For N95 masks, 19.5 million N95 masks."
2020-04-02,50:10,John Polowczyk,"And so if I was in a local hospital that was running short, I would look upward because the federal government has pushed out resources. So for protective gloves, 22.4 million pairs of protective gloves. For face shields, 5.2 million face shields. For ventilator we have pushed to the States more than 7,600 ventilators and I think as I was coming over here, that number has changed slightly. I think it’s now 7,640 given to predominantly these States. So we wanted you to have some numbers."
2020-04-02,51:01,John Polowczyk,"Now as we’ve indicated, we had ventilators in the national stockpile. We pushed ventilators out. We’re holding ventilators to put to the point to need. But we’re also buying ventilators, asking the industrial base who produces prior to COVID, approximately 30,000 ventilators a year. We are going to over the next several months, by the end of June work to acquire a hundred thousand."
2020-04-02,51:37,John Polowczyk,"And so one of the tools that I can anticipate needing, we’ve already executed is all of those vendors that we’re buying them from potentially will need help in their supply chains with their suppliers. We might rate orders, we might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor. So I think Mr. Navarro is going to talk a little bit more on that later."
2020-04-02,52:05,John Polowczyk,"So let me talk about the Airbridge. So it normally takes approximately 37 days to get from overseas, get product, load it, get it to the United States and distribute it. That’s about 37 days. So to prime the pump, so to speak, we have lined on an Airbridge to get product here faster. Working with our major suppliers as they work to fill orders to get more to health care workers now. We are working to align transportation to product."
2020-04-02,52:52,John Polowczyk,"And one of the things we’re also doing is the team that works for me are scouring the globe and finding pockets of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the US hospital supply chain. That is also going on these flights. Six completed and a number scheduled. 28 flights scheduled here in the near future. Where we are working towards some days we’ll have one flight, some days that might be two flights, multiple flights over the next coming days."
2020-04-02,53:27,John Polowczyk,"These 28 or as far as I can see out a couple of weeks. Then again, matching product to flights to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the 37 days. I’m just going to leave that up as I talk about a few other items."
2020-04-02,53:49,John Polowczyk,"So let’s talk about New York city and the public health hospitals. I believe they’re called New York City Health and Hospitals. President directed, as I speak there are pallets being formed, a truck being loaded. I gave an address in New York City here an hour or two ago and one of our distributors is making that happen and that delivery will happen tomorrow."
2020-04-02,54:24,John Polowczyk,"On the data front. This is almost unprecedented. This is a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributors of health equipment. We brought them all in and we said, we need to make informed decisions and we are going to help make informed allocation decisions. So within the matter of days feeding from their business systems, their enterprise resource like systems, I brought onboard a tool, a supply chain tower that the DOD was using to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system. Their data goes into a data link. We have a tool to be able to use their data and see it. I can tell what product is coming in. What their orders are, what they’re filling, what they’re not filling and see the volume in the supply chain and understand what they’re doing down to the county level. We’re working to get it potentially down to the hospital level."
2020-04-02,55:34,John Polowczyk,"So this 200 and some odd N95 respirators. We took a look in there in the supply chain we said we have the volume to go do that. I called the distributor and they’re making that happen. We anticipate as the hotspots around the country, we anticipate these vendors at our direction, helping them allocate product to the right place at the right time."
2020-04-02,56:05,John Polowczyk,"So if I talk finally about expanding the industrial base. So the Vice President was at Walmart the other day who told him, I want to get in this game, how do I do that? So I got the call. We provided them specifications and Walmart is going to use their suppliers to cut fabric, make gowns, sew product. But that’s not always the case. We have lots of folks that want to help. I believe you will see in the coming days the use of the Defense Production Act in creative ways to help people that are not doing this today to do it."
2020-04-02,56:44,John Polowczyk,"We have essentially leads. The number yesterday was 210 I believe, it probably grew today, that we are working with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game that’s not in the game to increase the throughput through the healthcare market."
2020-04-02,57:06,John Polowczyk,"Again, the President gave me one task, get more to our healthcare workers now. And I took that to heart because not that I don’t need that from the President that direction to move out, but I have family in New York. My sister’s a nurse practitioner in a Westchester Hospital and my niece is a nurse on a Long Island Hospital and I have other health care professionals in the family. So I have skin in this game. The President asked me to get more to the healthcare workers. I’m going to get more to healthcare workers. Like to hand over to Mr. Navarro."
2020-04-02,57:46,Mike Pence,[inaudible 00:57:49].
2020-04-02,57:46,John Polowczyk,"The 200,000 is going out as we speak."
2020-04-02,57:53,Mike Pence,Be very specific about that.
2020-04-02,57:55,John Polowczyk,It’ll be delivered tomorrow.
2020-04-02,57:59,Unnamed,Can I ask a question?
2020-04-02,58:00,Mike Pence,"Let me help me be clear on it if I can, what the Jared announced what the Admiral just unpacked is that pallets are being loaded right now to send 200,000 N95 masks to New York City to the public health hospitals."
2020-04-02,58:15,John Polowczyk,To the Public Health Warehouse in New York City.
2020-04-02,58:17,Mike Pence,All the healthcare workers help us on the way.
2020-04-02,58:21,Unnamed,"Based on the tools and the data you have available to you, where is the log jam? Where has it been? How have you identified that? Because as we say all of this, we have millions more PPE is going out the door, as you well know are front line on-"
2020-04-02,58:37,John Polowczyk,"I’m going to answer you this way. We put up a lot of numbers. I said that if you’re a hospital and you’re not seeing PPE, I would up to the state level first."
2020-04-02,58:46,Unnamed,We are hearing from governors. They are saying they can’t get the medical equipment that they need.
2020-04-02,58:52,Unnamed,And the reason for that is because according to governors and also by the fact that we haven’t seen any numbers up there about what is going to the private sector. Can you tell us what percentage of the supplies on these large cargo planes are going to private companies versus FEMA versus the States? Is it 80% ?
2020-04-02,59:13,John Polowczyk,So this product that we’re moving is primarily a commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distributed through a financial business transactions between hospitals and these distributors.
2020-04-02,59:33,Unnamed,So just to clarify that explains why States say they’re bidding like they’re on eBay because the supplies are going to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supplies.
2020-04-02,59:46,John Polowczyk,"So that’s normally how things work, right? So I’m not here to disrupt a supply chain. Say look these six distributors, six, seven, they have six to 700 warehouses. They have trucks to go to the hospital door every day. We’re bringing product in. They’re filling orders for hospitals, nursing homes, like normal. I’m putting volume into that system."
2020-04-02,01:00:22,John Polowczyk,"So we put together this data element over the last 13 days. Get the people in, look at the problem, build this. I am now seeing truth about what’s in the supply chain and I would say that there’s been some abnormal behavior. Okay."
2020-04-02,01:00:44,Unnamed,"Thank you Admiral. House Oversight Committee Democrats say the FEMA officials told them that the ventilators the government has ordered won’t be ready until June, which is well after the expected peak. Will the Defense Production Act memo signed today do anything to speed that up?"
2020-04-02,01:00:59,John Polowczyk,"Yeah, so we’ll have Mr. Navarro talk about that. We’re online to receive several thousand ventilators in the month of April and several thousand more ventilators in the month of May ramping up to a big number in June. Again, going from an industry that produces about 30,000 annually to a very big number."
2020-04-02,01:01:18,Unnamed,"Are you confident that the system means the States with the greatest need are getting the supplies? A lot of donors are saying that they can’t get what they need and different States have more and more pressing urgency. Obviously, depending on the case load."
2020-04-02,01:01:33,John Polowczyk,"So we’re marrying up where CDC, where the demand for COVID is to what’s in the commercial system. We’re providing that to the commercial system and we are making allocations to those of most pressing need. 13 days. We now have the data. We now can make informed decisions. And so all of the I need, I need, I need, I now know the volume that has been happening and needs to be happening."
2020-04-02,01:02:11,Unnamed,"So Admiral, with that, and Mr. President I’d love for you to weigh in on this as well. Well you alluded to the fact that there is possibly some shady business going on, that the product is here in the United States."
2020-04-02,01:02:25,Donald Trump,And coming here.
2020-04-02,01:02:25,Unnamed,"And yes, and it is coming here. It’s coming from China, it’s in warehouses, it’s being made here in the United States. It’s in warehouses. But it’s going to the highest bidder. So what can be done to keep those products here in the United States, not go overseas where companies are making a lot of money."
2020-04-02,01:02:44,John Polowczyk,"[crosstalk 01:02:44] Yeah, I’m going to let Mr. Navarro talk about that."
2020-04-02,01:02:44,Unnamed,And and get it distributed to the most critical places here in the US.
2020-04-02,01:02:50,John Polowczyk,[crosstalk 01:02:50] When the time comes. We are-
2020-04-02,01:02:53,Unnamed,"How’s that being done because doctors, I’ve talked to surgeons on a regular basis."
2020-04-02,01:02:57,Peter Navarro,[crosstalk 01:02:57] Great question. Let me give you the bigger view of the DPA and we’ll directly address that. What we have essentially is a nation at war. We have a wartime President standing behind me. The Defense Production Act is one of the most powerful weapons this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus.
2020-04-02,01:03:17,Peter Navarro,"When I spoke with you last week, I explained the three points of the compass DPA can be used to hit. The first one is mobilization of the industrial base. This can involve things like re- purposing from say a distiller like Pernod Ricad from liquor to hand sanitizer. It can also involve expansion of production, which is having Honeywell, which makes N95 masks open new factory in Smithfield, Rhode Island."
2020-04-02,01:03:47,Peter Navarro,"With respect to the second point of the compass, allocation of resources, we have two issues there. If you look at the manufacturer itself, you what you want to make sure is that the supply chain, which can go seven tiers deep, has enough components in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need and then once it’s made, you also want to make sure that it goes to the right people."
2020-04-02,01:04:10,Peter Navarro,"And then the third point in the compass, which addresses what you’re talking about is, is basically Bust Them, I call it. Hoarding of critical or threatened materials. So let me walk through what the President did today in terms of a strong action in what we’ve done with the DPA across those three points."
2020-04-02,01:04:29,Peter Navarro,"The first order President Trump signed was vigorous, swift. It was the GM order which directed GM to make ventilators in Kokomo, Indiana in Trump time, which is to say as fast as possible. As the President mentioned, he’d spoke to Mary Barr today, the CEO of GM. That is moving forward at the same time as the Ford project is moving forward in a Rawsonville, Michigan. And I’ve issued a challenge to those two companies out of Ford versus Ferrari. This is Ford versus GM. Let’s see who gets those ventilators out first."
2020-04-02,01:05:01,Peter Navarro,"Now, the second point of the compass, which these two orders address today is this allocation of resource issues. The ventilator companies themselves express concern that in this rush to build ventilators, there would be pressure on that supply chain. So what they requested that we do and the President do, is to use the DPA to give this gentleman here, is one of the strongest gentleman in the world in terms of applying things, is to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturers. And he will do things like give them what’s called a DO rating in the defense procurement, which will allow them to get what they need."
2020-04-02,01:05:43,Peter Navarro,"Now, the second order, which the President signed today has to do with the other part of the equation, which is once they make the stuff, okay, does it go to the right folks? And this is a 3m order. And, to be frank, over the last several days, we’ve had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3m does around the world, enough of it is coming back here to the right places. So what’s going to happen with the signing of that order in Trump time is we’re going to resolve that issue with 3m probably by tomorrow close of business. Because we can’t afford to lose days or hours or even minutes in this crisis."
2020-04-02,01:06:29,Peter Navarro,"Now the third part of the compass, this third point there, this gets to the hoarding issue. President stood up here, he’s the Commander In Chief, but we have a sheriff in town too, Attorney General Barr. And he stood up here with Attorney General Barr and Bill Barr said, “I’m going to go out and bust them.” And guess what? Three days ago DOJ went into a warehouse in Jersey, grabbed PPE and the beauty of that was it wasn’t only seized, but within hours it was turned around and given to healthcare professionals in New York and New Jersey. That’s a beautiful thing. That’s a beautiful case of using the DPA."
2020-04-02,01:07:11,Peter Navarro,"Now what’s going to happen tomorrow is President’s going to sign another order which is in the works. This is interesting. There is a black market springing up, which you have described where we’re having people bid against each other. Brokers come in. They’re bidding and bidding on all this different PPE. It’s driving the price up and guess what? You know where it’s going? The domestic sources here are being exported."
2020-04-02,01:07:39,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:07:39] That’s what [inaudible 01:07:41] told me.
2020-04-02,01:07:41,Peter Navarro,"When President Trump heard about that, he said that’s not going to happen anymore on my watch. So tomorrow we’re bringing that order and what it’s going to do is it’s going to empower Customs and Border Protection with the help of people like the Post Office and express mail consignors like UPS to basically deal with that issue."
2020-04-02,01:08:01,Peter Navarro,"So we are going to crack down unmercifully and I would say to the hoarders out there and the brokers who are trying to make money off of the misery of people in this country around the world. That’s got to stop. If you’ve got inventory, what you need to do is pick up a phone and not call somebody out around the world. You call FEMA and say we got some stuff. We’ll give it to you at a fair price and be done with that. Because that stuff has absolutely got to stop. So that’s-"
2020-04-02,01:08:27,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:33:30].
2020-04-02,01:08:27,Peter Navarro,Hang on. Hang on. So that’s what we’re going to be looking for and when we hear cases like this we are going to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it.
2020-04-02,01:08:37,Peter Navarro,"Now before, this is not my role to take a bunch of questions but let me tell you one other thing before I leave the podium. It’s a story which I’d love to share with you today. Because, this again illustrates one of the key principles of this President and this this Vice President, which is the wed, the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise."
2020-04-02,01:08:59,Peter Navarro,"And just two days ago we at The White House got an urgent SOS from the Chief Of Police of the New York Police Department and they are in a situation now because of the strain on their resources where personnel such as their homicide detectives were having to go on into houses and deal with COVID issues without protective gear. Now, the beauty of this President is because of his leadership, we were able to solve that problem in two phone calls. Two phone calls. The first one went to Phebe Novakovic at General Dynamics. Phoebe, can you call Tom Kennedy at Raytheon? I need you guys to basically scoop up all the tyvek suits you can and find any gloves you can."
2020-04-02,01:09:47,Peter Navarro,"This President under his leadership and that voluntary efforts and the pride and patriotism you talked about earlier that we had 4,000 Tyvec suits delivered to the New York PD within 16 hours. That’s a new record."
2020-04-02,01:10:03,Peter Navarro,"New York PD within 16 hours. That’s a new record in Trump time. At the same time, a second phone call was made to Tara Engle at Pernod Ricard and Laura Lane at UPS. They were on the same phone call and I said, “Tara, Laura, we got this issue. They need hand sanitizer.” Literally within two hours we had 50 gallon drums, 6,000 gallons of hand sanitizer on a UPS truck heading up to the NYPD and it probably arrived today with a promise from Pernod that they will continue to supply the MYPD throughout the course of this crisis. So this is a beautiful thing that America is rallying to. We are becoming a stronger, more United nation and I couldn’t be more proud of this president, this administration."
2020-04-02,01:10:50,Peter Navarro,"These guys up here are doing a heck of a job organizing the supply chain. And my promise to you is that the president is going to use that DPA to make sure that the American people, particularly our healthcare professionals, get the PPE, the medicines, everything we need. So let me stop there. I don’t think it’s my place here to the field a bunch of questions [crosstalk 01:11:14]."
2020-04-02,01:11:13,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:11:13] You did a good job, thank you."
2020-04-02,01:11:15,Journalist 1,[crosstalk 01:11:15] by American executive order?
2020-04-02,01:11:18,Donald Trump,"Go ahead. Go ahead, answer. You go ahead. Come here. Com here."
2020-04-02,01:11:26,Peter Navarro,"One of the things that this crisis has taught us, sir, is that we are dangerously overdependent on a global supply chain for our medicines like penicillin, our medical supplies like masks and our medical equipment like ventilators. We have right now as we speak, over 50 countries have already imposed some forms of export restrictions in their country against the rest of the world. And what we’re learning from that is that no matter how many treaties you have, no matter how many alliances, no matter how many phone calls, when push comes to shove, you run the risk as a nation of not having what you need and if there’s any vindication of the president’s by American secure borders and a strong manufacturing base philosophy, strategy and belief it is this crisis because it underscores everything that we see there."
2020-04-02,01:12:31,Peter Navarro,"So the “By American” order which is going through process, would do a couple things. It would simply say, not during this crisis because we don’t want to disrupt anything, I want to be really clear about that. But going forward after this is over the VA, DOD, HHS and this government, buys American for essential medicines, our medical countermeasures and the medical supplies and equipment we need. At the same time it will deregulate so we can get the FDA and EPA to facilitate domestic manufacturing and then innovate because the key here is having advanced manufacturing on U.S. Soil that can leapfrog other countries so we don’t have to worry about competing against cheap sweatshop labor, lacks environmental regulations, different tax regimes and the massive subsidies of foreign governments who are actually directly attacking our industrial base. So be patient with that, sir. The other priorities we have right now are the DPA and what the task force is doing. But if we learn anything from this crisis, it should be never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and counter measures."
2020-04-02,01:13:51,Donald Trump,"And by the way, we’ve cut them out also to be honest. We’ve stopped orders going from certain places and… In a couple of places we had a big order going to Italy on important outfits and some ventilators and it was going to Italy. They made the order a long time ago and I said, “You got to let it go.” They’ve had an order and I could have cut it under the act. I could have cut it. I said, “Nope, can’t do that. You’ve got to let it go.” They have big problems. We had an order going to Spain and I said, “Let it go.” I could have stopped it. I said, “Let it go. We’re going to be fine.” I said, “Let it go.” So it works that way also."
2020-04-02,01:14:27,Donald Trump,"One other thing that’s to your question, oftentimes, and we’ve told this to the governors, Mike, we’ve been very strong on this. If you think there’s bidding between federal government and state, let us know and we’ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price… [crosstalk 00:04:46]."
2020-04-02,01:14:45,Journalist 2,[crosstalk 01:14:45] bidding against each other?
2020-04-02,01:14:45,Donald Trump,"No. No. If we’re bidding against each other I said find out who it is. And usually they know, everyone knows and we’re notified and we get notified and we’ll either drop out or they’ll drop out. But we have another problem. There are 151 countries out there beyond the States. There are 151 countries that have this problem and they’re ordering, too. It’s really a mess [crosstalk 01:15:09] Now in a little while the hardest thing to get are the ventilators because it takes a while to build them and we have thousands of them being built right now. In a little while they’ll be worth about $5 but right now they’re very valuable and we’re going to have a lot of them being shipped. In fact, that’s why General Motors called up before, Mary. That’s why others called up two days ago. They called up that they’re all in production and they’re starting to arrive in a week and a half, but there’ll be a time when we’re going to build stockpiles."
2020-04-02,01:15:41,Donald Trump,"By the way, the States should have been building their stockpile. We have almost 10,000 and our stockpile and we’ve been building it and we’ve been supplying it, but the States should be building. We’re a backup. We’re not an ordering clerk. We’re a back up and we’ve done an unbelievable job. Like for instance, whoever heard of a governor calling up, ” Sir, can you build us a hospital of 2,500 rooms?” And we built it. “Can you build us four medical centers?” We built it. “Can you deliver a ship, a hospital ship with a thousand rooms?” And we did it and we did it in Los Angeles, too. We’ve been unbelief. We’ve done an unbelievable job… These people and thousands of people behind them, but we’re a backup. Ideally those hospitals would have had all this equipment. Ideally those States should have had all this equipment and I think they will the next time."
2020-04-02,01:16:32,Donald Trump,"You heard the case where thousands of ventilators could have been had at a very inexpensive price three years ago and a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it’s big money. You’re talking about, I think it was $1 billion, but you’re talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen. Because normally on a ventilator other than a pandemic or an epidemic, you wouldn’t need anything like this. Hospitals have three ventilators, big hospitals, and they get by with it. And now they want thousands. I mean they want thousands of ventilators. You call up a governor and they’ll say, “Sir, could you send us 40,000 ventilators?” Nobody has ever heard of a thing like this. So they’ve done some job. Let me just tell you when secretary Mnuchin spoke, they want you to call not .com but sba.gov, okay? For the application and for information, okay? So it’s SBA, small business, sba.gov, okay? If you don’t mind. Yeah, let’s go, please…"
2020-04-02,01:17:40,Journalist 3,"Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to follow up from a question yesterday regarding your administration’s denial of the expansion Obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic. In your own words, VP Pence gave a five minute a non answer, but people facing this pandemic illness and even worse, most experts say that having healthcare is critical to our nation’s health and financial wellbeing. Can you assure Americans tonight that you will reopen Obamacare marketplace so that they can be covered in this time of combined health and financial crisis?"
2020-04-02,01:18:10,Donald Trump,"Yeah. I understand the question and we’re doing better than that. We’re going to try and get a cash payment to the people and we’re working out the mechanics of that with legislature, so we’re going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn’t help as much. So we’re going to work it out so we’re going to try and get for that certain group of people… It’s a certain group of people, a cash payment."
2020-04-02,01:18:36,Journalist 2,"I really want to ask you about masks, but I also just meant to follow up on a couple of hanging threads there. Just the question earlier about the bidding. What happens though when States are bidding against each other on those markets?"
2020-04-02,01:18:47,Donald Trump,"Well, they have that and they have to work that out. What they should do is they should have, long before this pandemic arrived, they should have been, on the open market, just buying. There was no competition. You could have made a great price. The States have to stock up. It’s like one of those things they waited, they didn’t want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen and their shelves in some cases were bare. And by the way, in some cases they weren’t. They were beautifully serviced. They did a good job, but in some cases their shelves were bare."
2020-04-02,01:19:18,Donald Trump,"So the best thing they can do is when times become normalized, and they will hopefully soon… And actually you’re going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in terms of protective gear, protective outfits, a lot’s being done. It’s going to be within six months. It’s going to be sold for the right price. They got to stack up for the next time. But we are doing that and the Admiral’s done a fantastic job. Senator Schumer wrote a letter today and he says, you should put a military manager. Just said, well, “Chuck, if you knew a little bit more, we have one of the most highly respected people in the military, the Admiral. This is what he does, too. Very professionally. And he’s in charge.” But Chuck didn’t know that."
2020-04-02,01:20:02,Donald Trump,Okay.
2020-04-02,01:20:04,Journalist 4 ,"Mr. President, you tweeted this morning about your call with Saudi Arabia’s MBS. We’ve had some people say that the figures that you cited between 10 million and 15 million barrels per day is not what they’re agreeing to. Can you be more specific about [crosstalk 01:20:19]"
2020-04-02,01:20:19,Donald Trump,"I don’t know what they’re agreeing to. I think they might agree to more than that. Look, Russia [crosstalk 01:20:26] yeah, we did say that actually. Russia talked about 10 million barrels. Russia and Saudi Arabia are fighting over this and as everybody knows, it’s really killing an industry, hurting Russia badly, hurting Saudi Arabia badly. I said, “This is an easy one. It should be an easy one.” And it may be 10 and it may be more than that. I was actually told it may be 10 as I told somebody before, it may be 10 and it may be more than that. Maybe it’s 15 maybe it goes up to 15 could be as high as 15 and there’s a tremendous oversupply right now. That industry was oversupplied before the virus and where the virus came along, they lost 35, 40% of the world."
2020-04-02,01:21:14,Donald Trump,"And there’s an unbelievable… You can’t get a ship now. Every ship is loaded to the gills sitting out someplace in the ocean. They’re storage tanks, they’re not even ships, they’re storage tanks. So it would be great for Russia. It would be great for Saudi Arabia. I hope they make that deal. But that’s what they told me. They said it’s… [crosstalk 01:21:31] Well, I think it’ll be hopefully soon. I think hopefully they’ll announce something soon. Now can a deal be broken? Can something happen where it doesn’t happen? I guess in which case there’s another alternative, but I’d rather not see that other alternative. I hope they can make a deal. I think they both want to make a deal and they’re both smart. They love their countries, they want to make a deal. It’s good, but it’s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry. Go ahead. Go ahead in the back."
2020-04-02,01:22:02,Journalist 5,What do you mean by cash payments?
2020-04-02,01:22:06,Donald Trump,"We went over this very specifically and I’ll let you talk about it, Mike, as you responded last time."
2020-04-02,01:22:11,Mike Pence,"Right. Thank you, Mr. President. As I said yesterday, the president has put a priority on ensuring that no American has to worry about the cost of coronavirus testing. And we’ve been working every day to make sure that Americans don’t have to worry about the cost of treatment. And at this point, the White House coronavirus task force is working on a proposal for the president to use some of the $100 billion that we’re making available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured Americans. We’re working out the details of that. The president will make a final decision tomorrow. We expect an announcement."
2020-04-02,01:22:54,Mike Pence,"But the president’s made it very clear. We don’t want any American to worry about the cost of getting a test or the cost of getting treatment and we’ve expanded coverage through Medicaid. We’ve expanded coverage through Medicare. Health insurance companies around the country, including Blue Cross just today announced that all of their members will be waiving all co payments on coronavirus treatment. But for those some 30 odd million uninsured Americans, the president has directed the coronavirus task force to find a way to make sure that they know we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment and the president will be addressing that and announcing that tomorrow."
2020-04-02,01:23:39,Journalist 6,"[crosstalk 01:23:39] Mr. President, a point of clarification and then a follow up question. Yesterday you said that you spoke to Florida governor Ron DeSantis before he issued his stay at home order. Did you advise him to issue that order?"
2020-04-02,01:23:50,Donald Trump,"No, but I talked to him about it and he wants to do what’s right for the people of Florida. He’s been a great governor. You could see that just by his popularity, which is extraordinary. We’re proud of him. He’s done a fantastic job. And he made the decision, but we spoke before he made the decision. Yes."
2020-04-02,01:24:07,Journalist 6,And he’s also said that he is considering putting people who are suspected of having coronavirus or who have tested positive for it in isolation centers so that he could [crosstalk 00:14:17].
2020-04-02,01:24:18,Donald Trump,"That I haven’t heard, no. That I haven’t heard."
2020-04-02,01:24:18,Journalist 6,So hasn’t consulted with you?
2020-04-02,01:24:20,Donald Trump,I haven’t heard that.
2020-04-02,01:24:21,Journalist 7,"Thank you, Mr. President. Ebony Bowden from the New York Post. A few hours ago, mayor De Blasio, the Mayer of New York, said that New Yorkers leaving their hearts to wear masks, they should also wear masks when they’re with other people. Are you considering that kind of recommendation on a federal level? And if you are, how would you prevent a rush on N95 masks?"
2020-04-02,01:24:40,Donald Trump,"Well, I think they’re going to be coming out with regulations on that and if people want to abide by them, frankly, I don’t think they’ll be mandatory because some people don’t want to do that. But if people want… As an example on the masks, if people wanted to wear them, they can. If people wanted to use scarves, which they have, many people have them, they can. In many cases the scarf is better. It’s thicker. Depending on the material, it’s thicker. But they could do that if they want. Now a recommendation’s coming out. We’ll see what that recommendation is. [crosstalk 01:25:14] But I will say this, they can pretty much decide for themselves right now."
2020-04-02,01:25:18,Journalist 8,[crosstalk 01:25:18] nationwide? And can I just also ask… [crosstalk 01:25:19] and I think this as best for Dr. Burke’s. But we’ve heard some differing guidance here. The WHO and even the surgeon general have talked about various studies that show that masks in addition to maybe not even being helpful to protecting people may actually increase the rates of illness because people touch the masks and they touch themselves. Can you talk a little bit about just the evolution of your thinking on this? [crosstalk 01:25:42].
2020-04-02,01:25:40,Donald Trump,All right. Maybe I will ask Dr. Burkes. And you might mention that other point also.
2020-04-02,01:25:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah. Thank you. So I hope you got from the conference today that we’re triangulating data that we know from the case numbers, the testing numbers, the supply chain numbers to create an integrated picture so that we can really support hospitals in their needs. And I think that level of granularity is really critical. Secondly, I just want to make the point that we really applaud the governors that are looking at a whole of state or a whole of metro approach. And what do I mean by that? The United States going into this had about 160,000 ventilators across the United States and another 60,000 to 70,000 anesthesia machines. That’s about five times what most of the European countries have, but it’s a matter of distribution to need and I really applaud the governors that are bringing together their public hospitals with their more private hospitals and their visibility across their state."
2020-04-02,01:26:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Because what we tried to talk about yesterday is every state, every county is different. That’s why we’re looking at it at that level of granularity. And as we move through this epidemic, the needs need to be very tailored to those counties and frankly, those hospitals. There is a reason why the president and Mr. Kushner have been very much involved in finding out what the public hospitals need. Why is that? Because the public hospitals sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they’re often sometimes not as attractive to private sector distributors or they may be too busy caring for the needs of patients to be really on top of their order forms and their supply chains. So really listening to the community that’s at the front of the of this fight and getting feedback from those specific communities no matter where they are and listening to the frontline healthcare workers because it’s their reality that is important to all of us, whether you’re the mayor or the governor or the federal government."
2020-04-02,01:27:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And if they are saying they need something, we have to work together to supply that. And so that’s what you’re seeing with this triangulation. Every county will move through this differently and that allows us to move around these vital issues that protect the frontline healthcare workers and protect the patients through the ventilators to make sure that the supply chain is aligned with the need as it happens. Now you have to have very good data in order to be willing to work in that level of granularity. And that’s what we’ve been working on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that. So I just wanted to say one other thing about testing. Just to give you the bottom line data of what we’re seeing. We appreciate the groups who are reporting. Not everyone is reporting yet. And this is part of us trying to understand at a very granular level, we do have two States that do have 35% positives and that’s New York and New Jersey."
2020-04-02,01:28:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So that confirms very clearly that that’s a very clear and important hot spot. Louisiana though has 26% of their tests are positive. Michigan, Connecticut, Indiana, Georgia, Illinois… So that should tell you where the next hotspots are coming, are at 15% test positive. And then Colorado, DC, Rhode Island and Massachusetts are at 13%. There’s a significant number of States still under 10% everyone that I didn’t discuss. California and Washington remains steady at an 8% rate. So what we’re seeing finally is testing improving, more testing being done, still a high level of negatives in States without hotspots, allowing them to do more of this surveillance and containment. And then prioritizing this new rapid test kit to those areas that may not have the same amount of access to the Indian health services and to the public health institutions and the public health and state labs so that they can use that and start forward leaning into surveillance. Now we know there are people waiting for tests and they’re waiting for tests because when these areas got onto the logarithmic curve, we prioritized people where the test decision would make it critical for their care. And so we prioritized hospitals and we prioritize nurses and doctors and frontline workers. So that means if you went through a drive through or you went through your doctor, you could have that delay. So the masks? So what I tried to give you is how we’re using data in a very granular way. And so there is experiential data when you look at communities that have oftentimes utilized masks in general for personal protection from when they particularly are themselves sick and have used their masks in public. And we’ve looked at the rate of this Covid-19 in those populations. And then we’re looking at the scientific evidence to bring those two pieces together. Let me just say one thing though. The most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands. And we don’t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they’re behind a mask. Because if they’re touching things, remember your eyes are not in the mask. So if you’re touching things and then touching your eyes, you’re exposing yourself in the same way. So we don’t want people to feel like, “Oh, I’m wearing a mask, I’m protected and I’m protecting others.” You may be protecting others but don’t get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected because there are other ways that you can get infected because of the number of asymptomatic and mild cases that are out there."
2020-04-02,01:31:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so this worries us and that’s why the debate is continuing about the mask because we don’t want… When we’re trying to send a signal that every single person in this country needs to stay six feet away from everybody. That needs to be washing their hands constantly and know where their hands are to send a signal that we think a mask is equivalent to those pieces. So when the advisory comes out, it will be an additive piece if it comes out rather than saying, “This is a substitute for”, and we want to make sure everybody understands it is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out. And to be absolutely clear about that."
2020-04-02,01:32:31,Journalist 9,"Quick question about [crosstalk 01:32:33] the test. There’s a lot of evidence we’re seeing, the experts are saying that a high number of these tests could be producing false negatives. So…"
2020-04-02,01:32:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,Of the Roche and Abbott test?
2020-04-02,01:32:48,Journalist 9,That as many as one in three tests might be providing false negatives. I thought maybe you could explain [crosstalk 01:32:54].
2020-04-02,01:32:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That would almost be impossible with having 35% positives. If that was true, you would have 100% positive or 66% positive. So what I can tell you is the number of positive tests is tracking very closely with the number of cases diagnosed. So I will look into that. I look at the Roche and Abbott numbers every night. They’re trending exactly in the same way and that’s important when you’re validating data to really validate does this same site… In other words, I’m looking between testing sites to see are there consistencies, is there an anomaly to make sure for what you just very specifically asked. So I will go back and look at it more carefully. I haven’t seen that kind of anomaly."
2020-04-02,01:33:42,Dr. Deborah Birx,"This same platform is being used across the and that’s a range from what I reported, 3% positivity up to 35% positivity and that range reflects also what we’re seeing with the hotspots and the number of cases and frankly, we hate to talk about it, but it also tracks with the hospitalizations independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we’re seeing. So all of those pieces validate together."
2020-04-02,01:34:10,Journalist 9,[crosstalk 01:34:10] you concerned that people might be getting a false sense of security or that we might not be seeing all of the data here on the composite?
2020-04-02,01:34:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, I’m telling you that I’m still missing 50% of the data from reporting. I have 660 tests reported in. We’ve done 1.3 million. So there is… And it could be those sites. So we do need to see… The bill said you need to report. We’re still not receiving 100% of the tests."
2020-04-02,01:34:36,Journalist 10,"[crosstalk 01:34:36] With regard to the test, the President’s sample collection took one minute, results were reported back in 15 minutes. I realized you’re the president of the United States, but when will everyone get to take a test that works that quickly and you get results that quickly?"
2020-04-02,01:34:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So these are new tests and we have prioritized the groups that we think have the least access to testing now. And who do we mean by that? We mean the Indian health service. They’re often in remote areas, rural areas. The governors of the Northwestern States that may not have the advantage of these high throughput machines that are often across the East coast and in high metro areas, Colorado and then across the West coast. So we’ve prioritized the presidential 15 minute test to the Indian health services and public health labs so that they can support nursing home testing and other areas where we think surveillance is absolutely key. So at this moment they’re prioritized in that way. [crosstalk 01:35:38] Yes, 1,200 of them are going out in that way."
2020-04-02,01:35:41,Journalist 10,[crosstalk 01:35:41] Do more of those tests need to be made in order for more people…
2020-04-02,01:35:43,Donald Trump,They are being made.
2020-04-02,01:35:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,Yeah.
2020-04-02,01:35:45,Journalist 10,Okay. So in a matter of…
2020-04-02,01:35:46,Donald Trump,They’re moving very quickly.
2020-04-02,01:35:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I’m glad you asked that because today, there’s 18,000 of these machines already out there. We’re trying to find out exactly where everyone is because you can see that gives you amazing flexibility because if people would allow it to be loaned to a state that’s in a hot spot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance, 18,000 tests, 18,000 machines is a huge amount and it really gets to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we’re moving out what is new. So really figuring out who should those go to, how can we ask communities, because these will be in the community, to share those machines into the community who need the testing now. And I think that’s really an incredible question that really needs to be answered over the next 24 hours."
2020-04-02,01:36:42,Journalist 11,A point of clarity about the face covering guidance. You said it’s still a point of debate. You said they use the phrase “the guidance if it comes out.” Is the guidance coming out and when?
2020-04-02,01:36:52,Mike Pence,Yes.
2020-04-02,01:36:53,Journalist 11,"And when, sir?"
2020-04-02,01:36:54,Mike Pence,"In the days ahead, we’re currently working through the task force seeking the consultation advice of the CDC, our top health experts, and we’ll be bringing forward the guidance from the CDC in the next several days."
2020-04-02,01:37:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Just remember it’s not a substitute for everything that we’re asking people to do. And just do that to everybody out there across the country, when we say no gatherings of 10, we want it to be clear if you have a family of 10 we don’t want you to be split up. But we don’t expect people to be having dinner parties, cocktail parties. I know you’ve seen the slope in the United States versus the slope in Italy and we have to change that slope. We have to change the logarithmic curve that we’re on."
2020-04-02,01:37:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We see country after country having done that. What it means in the United States is not everyone is doing it. So we’re only as strong is every community, every county, every state, every American following the guidelines to a T. And I can tell by the curve and as it is today that not every American is following it, and so this is really a call to action. We see Spain, we see Italy, we see France, we see Germany. When we see others beginning to bend their curves, we can bend ours, but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as Americans."
2020-04-02,01:38:31,Journalist 11,"[crosstalk 01:38:31] Mr. President, can I have a quick follow up on oil, please. In your conversations with Russia and Saudi Arabia, did you have to make any concessions to get them to agree to cut their production? Like did you agree to taught us production of oil?"
2020-04-02,01:38:45,Donald Trump,We didn’t discuss that. They want to do that. That’s good for their countries and we did not discuss that now.
2020-04-02,01:38:52,Journalist 11,[crosstalk 01:38:52] NBC News has learned that the Navy is set to fire the Captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt after he raised red flags about the Covid-19 outbreak on his ship. It appears as if he’s being punished for trying to save the lives of the sailors in his command. What’s your assessment?
2020-04-02,01:39:09,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:39:09] we’re going to wait a little while because I understand there’s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that. But you know, I don’t agree with that at all. Not at all. Not even a little bit. Yeah."
2020-04-02,01:39:20,Journalist 12,Thank you. This morning you said once again that New York got off to a late start and they should have pushed harder but governors and other state leaders say they rely on the federal government to assess the situation and how risky it is and they want to know how would they have known to start sooner without your guidance?
2020-04-02,01:39:42,Donald Trump,"Well, they have experts and frankly long after we came out and talked about it… Look, how would I have known to cut off China? I cut off China very early and if I didn’t, we would have a chart that you wouldn’t believe. So how would I know to do that? How would I know to cut off Europe? I cut off Europe very early. You have to make a decision. People knew that some bad things were going on and they got off to a late start and some others got off to a late start also, but we cut off China. If we didn’t cut off China, we would have been in some big trouble and we cut it off and you know what? We cut it off way early. Go ahead"
2020-04-02,01:40:31,Journalist 13,"Mr. President, a follow up on the insurance point in a separate question that came in from a colleague who can’t be in the room."
2020-04-02,01:40:38,Donald Trump,"Okay, go ahead."
2020-04-02,01:40:38,Journalist 13,"On the insurance point is they’re going to, [crosstalk 01:40:42]."
2020-04-02,01:40:41,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-04-02,01:40:42,Journalist 13,"Roll Call. Is there going to be an opportunity for insurance companies, if in fact hospitals are compensated for uncompensated care, are the insurance companies going to also get compensated for its extraordinary expenses that they may have or they you’re assuming that cost?"
2020-04-02,01:41:02,Donald Trump,"So we haven’t discussed it but we’re talking to them. Getting them not to pay copays in the case of the big ones was a tremendous thing. That’s a lot of money they gave up, but we’re discussing that with the insurance companies. We’ll let you know. It’ll be pretty quickly. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-04-02,01:41:16,Journalist 14,"I have a question on Japan, sir. They are expanding their entry ban to include the United States. Are you planning to take any similar action to ban Japanese nationals from coming to the U.S. as a result of this crisis?"
2020-04-02,01:41:31,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re looking at a lot of things and a lot of different bans. We have more bans than anybody. We had bans when bans weren’t fashionable, if you remember right at the beginning of this administration was for different reasons. But we’ve had bans long before people thought of bans. When I did China, it had never been done before. I was the first one to do to remember that it had never, according to what I read it all the papers, this had never been done. This is a terrible thing to do. And four weeks later they were all saying, we’re lucky we did it. So we’re looking at it. No, we heard that. And I think it’s fine that they do that. They’re trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country. Yeah, please."
2020-04-02,01:42:15,Journalist 10,"[crosstalk 01:42:15] Mr. President, I asked you yesterday about stay at home orders and if that decision should be left in the hands of governors or if you’re considering telling the entire nation, “Stay at home.” So just today, Georgia’s governor finally issued a stay at home order saying that “Individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad, but we didn’t know that until the last 24 hours.” Is that ignorance, gross incompetence? [crosstalk 01:42:40]"
2020-04-02,01:42:40,Donald Trump,"He’s a good governor, Brian Kemp. He’s a very good… [crosstalk 01:42:42] he’s a good."
2020-04-02,01:42:43,Journalist 10,Have you been having calls with these governors?
2020-04-02,01:42:43,Donald Trump,"He’s a good governor and he has to make his own decision on that. I let the States… I think we’re about 85% a positive on that. If you look, I think it’s about 85% of the States have got the stay at home. Brian’s a great governor. It’s his decision. He made that decision. Ultimately he decided to go along with it and they’re doing well and the state is doing well in many respects. Yeah, go ahead please."
2020-04-02,01:43:07,Journalist 5,This is another question from a colleague who couldn’t make it in today from Emily Goodin at The Daily Mail. I had a question in regards to the Russian plane that landed at JFK with medical supplies. Did the United States ask Russia for this aid or is it just accepting it?
2020-04-02,01:43:21,Donald Trump,"We’re accepting it. It was a very nice offer from President Putin. I spoke to him the other night as I told you, and they had excess medical equipment, things and I’ll take it, I’ll take it. I think it’s very nice. [crosstalk 01:43:36] We’ve had some from China. We also help other countries. We like doing that. Like I said before, if we have excess stuff, we let it go out. We let some go out where frankly they had orders for it and I didn’t want to stop orders. It was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin and I could have said “No thank you” or I could have said “Thank you” and it was a large plane of very high quality medical supplies and I said, ” I’ll take it.”"
2020-04-02,01:44:01,Journalist 5,"Is he offering any further aid, in your conversation?"
2020-04-02,01:44:04,Donald Trump,"I think he would if we asked for it, but he was very nice. It was part of the call he suggested. He said, we have it, it’s additional. They have very big difficulties with this virus also, as you know, Russia. I thought it was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin. I could’ve said, “No, I don’t want it.” Or I could have said, “I’ll take it”, and you know what? I said, “I’ll take it.”"
2020-04-02,01:44:24,Journalist 5,[crosstalk 01:44:24] accept further aid?
2020-04-02,01:44:25,Donald Trump,"I think so. Yeah. If they sent things that we need, I’d take it. Sure. Nice gesture."
2020-04-02,01:44:30,Journalist 15,[crosstalk 01:44:30] Are you concerned about Russian propaganda?
2020-04-02,01:44:31,Donald Trump,"I’m not concerned about Russian propaganda. Not even a little bit. He offered a lot of medical, high quality stuff that I accepted, and that may save a lot of lives. I’ll take it everyday. Please. In the back."
2020-04-02,01:44:45,Journalist 16,[crosstalk 01:44:45] Mr. President you said that in January that you stand with the people of Iran since the beginning of your presidency and you’ll continue to stand with the people of Iran. Given the fact they’re so hard hit with coronavirus [crosstalk 01:44:57].
2020-04-02,01:44:56,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re very hard hit. They’re very hard hit. [crosstalk 01:44:57]"
2020-04-02,01:44:56,Journalist 16,But would you consider… [crosstalk 01:45:01].
2020-04-02,01:44:56,Donald Trump,"In a lot of ways they’re hard hit. They’re hard hit with their economy, with their military."
2020-04-02,01:45:03,Donald Trump,"Hard hit. They are hit with their economy, with their military, and obviously the virus. They’re very hard hit."
2020-04-02,01:45:07,Unnamed (Reporter),Would you consider easing sanctions to allow medical supplies to get in?
2020-04-02,01:45:11,Donald Trump,"Well, they haven’t even asked us to do that."
2020-04-02,01:45:12,Unnamed (Reporter),"But we know that sanctions hit the people, not the government."
2020-04-02,01:45:16,Donald Trump,"You know what? They haven’t even asked us to do that. If they want to meet, would love to meet and we’d love to settle the whole thing out, but I doubt they’ll be."
2020-04-02,01:45:24,Unnamed (Reporter),"So, realistically, how does a person in Tehran pick up the phone and call you?"
2020-04-02,01:45:27,Donald Trump,"I think they love America. I think the Iranians love America. I think they’d love to be free. I think they’d love to have just some of the things that we have. I remember Iran many years ago, friends of mine were always in Iran. They were doing real estate deals in Iran. They were building beautiful buildings all over Iran. Apartment houses. They were very successful and then one day that came to an end, but you know what? The people of Iran, they remember that. It was a long time ago, but not so long ago, and they remember it. And I’ll tell you, they love America. They love what we stand for and we’re not looking for change. We’re not looking for government takeover. Government change. This country has been through that many times. That doesn’t work."
2020-04-02,01:46:10,Unnamed (Reporter),"But you hope people do encourage other countries, who are maybe concerned about-"
2020-04-02,01:46:14,Donald Trump,"No, but what I did is I put it out very publicly with respect to Iran. I said, if they need help with respect to the virus, we have the greatest medical professionals in the world. We’d love to send them over."
2020-04-02,01:46:26,Unnamed (Reporter),What countries are you encouraging perhaps to lend their support because there are many countries that feel-
2020-04-02,01:46:30,Donald Trump,"I’m not encouraging or discouraging. They’ve been a very hostile country. They made a deal that President Obama should have never made. It was a short-term deal, giving them $150 billion, giving them $1.8 billion in cash. Green. Fill up this room five times."
2020-04-02,01:46:47,Unnamed (Reporter),"But, your administration, do you have a moral responsibility?"
2020-04-02,01:46:49,Donald Trump,"Nobody’s even asked. I have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask. If they needed help, I would certainly consider different plans."
2020-04-02,01:46:58,Unnamed (Reporter),The United Nations says they need help.
2020-04-02,01:47:00,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s up to the United Nations. I’m talking about us and what happens is, if they wanted help, because they have a very big case of virus. A very, very big case. One of the worst on earth, if you believe what you’re reading. And I happen to believe what I see and what I know and if they wanted help, we’d give them help. Yeah, you had one in the back."
2020-04-02,01:47:23,Unnamed (Reporter),"Thanks, Mr. President. And a question for Jared too. You talk about a granular approach to receiving data from these different states and regions to try and figure out what they need. The president, you just enacted the BPA on ventilators and masks. Are there any signals from across the country that might indicate there are other things besides masks and ventilators that are slowly rising in terms of need, like hand sanitizer for instance?"
2020-04-02,01:47:54,Jared Kushner,"Sure. So, the first issue that we’ve been dealing with was really the ventilators. That the number one, number two, and number three from all the states. What we’ve been finding is that people have a lot of these requests based on the models. And what we’ve been trying to do over at FEMA is say to the States, “Well, if you would like ventilators, first look in your states.” For example, in Northern Jersey, they’re going down to Southern Jersey and they’re finding ventilators and trying to relocate them to where they have their hotspots. The second thing that we’ve done is we’ve asked them to survey for alternative ventilators. Dr. Birx spoke before about the anesthesia machines and the ability to convert them to be ventilators. So, we’re asking people to be resourceful inside their states before they come to the federal government. The third thing we’ve been asking states to do is to provide what their daily utilization rates are. So, everyone’s asking for everything."
2020-04-02,01:48:41,Jared Kushner,"One Congressman got a call from his local hospitals saying, “I need 250 ventilators.” And he said, “Well, you don’t have a COVID patient within four counties. Why do you want 250 ventilators?” And he says, “Well, we just want to be safe. We’re very nervous right now.” So, what you have all over the country is a lot of people are asking for things that they don’t necessarily need at the moment. And the job of FEMA and Admiral Polowczyk has been to try to make sure that we’re getting the real data from the cities, from the states, that we can make real-time allocation decisions based on the data. Right now, what’s happening is a lot of the different cities and states are providing FEMA that information, we’re talking to them daily, they’re updating that information daily, and that’s enabling the federal government to make much more informed decisions on where they position ventilators."
2020-04-02,01:49:26,Jared Kushner,"You also have a situation where in some states, FEMA allocated ventilators to the states and you have instances where in cities they’re running out, but the state still has a stockpile and the notion of the federal stockpile was, it’s supposed to be our stockpile. It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use. So, we’re encouraging the states to make sure that they’re assessing the needs, they’re getting the data from their local situations, and then trying to fill it with the supplies that we’ve given them. The same thing with the masks. So, the N95 mask is actually an item that wasn’t used as frequently in the medical profession before this. It was used mostly for diseases. So, speaking to a lot of the doctors and hospital administrators, they would say they used actually a very low percentage of the N95 masks."
2020-04-02,01:50:08,Jared Kushner,"What the president and the vice president were able to do with Congress was to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of N masks were used for the construction industry. So, now there’s a much bigger pool of masks in the country. There was a stockpile. They distributed that based on where they anticipated a lot of the need would go, but a lot of that still is stuck with the states and it hasn’t trickled down to the right places within the state. So, I would just encourage you, when you have governors saying that the federal government hasn’t given them what they need, I would just urge you to ask them, “Well, have you looked within your state to make sure that you haven’t been able to find the resources?” Unlike other countries, a lot of the medical system in America is private. It’s not public, government-controlled."
2020-04-02,01:50:47,Jared Kushner,"So, you have to get the data from what’s in their state. Look at it in that way, and then make sure that they’re being resourceful in a way to do that. Also ask them what their utilization percentage is, because if one governor’s asking for more ventilators and if the federal government sends them more than they need, the goal here is not to have ventilators sitting in a warehouse where you have another state where you have people who need them. So, what we’re trying to do is make informed data-driven decisions both on ventilators, masks, any other supply we can get to make sure it’s going to the people who need them."
2020-04-02,01:51:19,Unnamed (Reporter),"I wonder if you could weigh in on the reports, which I’m sure you’re aware, where unnamed White House officials have described your role as being something of running a shadow task force. How do you describe your role? How do you describe the qualifications you bring to your role?"
2020-04-02,01:51:32,Jared Kushner,"Yeah. I would just say very simply, look, the president asked the vice president to run the task force. The vice president asked me to assist. I’ve been serving really at the direction of the vice president. He’s asked me to get involved in different projects. The vice president and I speak probably sometimes five, 10 times a day, but everything that I’m doing is that the direction of the vice president. If some people are talking to you, that means they’re probably not informed as to what’s going on. But I can assure you that I’m speaking with Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, the vice president, and the president multiple times a day to make sure that I’m accomplishing and focusing on the objectives that the vice president deems a priority."
2020-04-02,01:52:12,Unnamed (Reporter),"Jared, a follow-up on the ventilators-"
2020-04-02,01:52:12,Donald Trump,"Or they don’t exist. Those sources don’t exist. They’re fake sources. A lot of fake sources out there. They don’t exist. For a lot of time I’ve been reading, a lot of the fake sources they don’t exist. The national stockpile,"
2020-04-02,01:52:19,Unnamed (Reporter),"Thank you, Mr. President. Jared, what triggers sending a ventilator from the national stockpile to a state? In other words, how sick does somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilators?"
2020-04-02,01:52:33,Jared Kushner,"Well, that’s not the criteria. You have the states basically putting in the request and they’re giving us their utilization percentages. So, it’s a very simple formula. The states should know how many ventilators they have in their states. And by the way, some governors you speak to are senators and they don’t know what’s in their state. Some governors I’ll speak to and they’ll know to the number how many ventilators they have in their state because that’s the first thing a good manager will do. What a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or governor or president, you’re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis. This is a time of crisis and you’re seeing certain people are better managers than others."
2020-04-02,01:53:11,Jared Kushner,"So, what I would say is that the way that the federal government’s trying to allocate it as they’re trying to make sure a, you have your data. Don’t ask us for things when you know that when you don’t know what you have in your own state. Just because you’re scared, you ask your medical professionals and they don’t know, you have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there’s a real need. So, we pre-positioned a lot of things because most governors off the bat didn’t know what they needed, but FEMA has a joint command with Admiral Polowczyk, Admiral Giroir and Pete Gaynor, where every couple of hours when their requests come in, they evaluate the request, they all vote on the requests, and then if there’s something that they want to elevate to the task force, they bring it to the vice president to make a recommendation. [crosstalk 01:53:53]"
2020-04-02,01:53:54,Mike Pence,"We’re literally tracking hospitalization cases on a daily basis, interacting with governors and health systems, and that informs our supply chain decisions."
2020-04-02,01:54:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, I want to thank the health commissioners and all of them that have been sending hospital data in. I think it’s really critical and important to all of us. New York City has been providing information, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and certainly Louisiana in these hotspots. That allows us, we can see where they are with the rising number of cases, where they are in their curve, what can be predicted, and really ensuring that people get what they need as they need it. So, I think many of the governors now and the health commissioners have been, “I’m intubating 20 people a day. Now I have enough for the next three days. If that doubles, we’re seeing our hospitalization rates stabilizing, but we still think there will be this many more in the next days.” That’s the information that they then translate into providing the ventilators. So, when you see the ventilator numbers going out, they’re going out in 150s and 200s because I think early on, we sent a big bolus out and then not all of them even today have been fully utilized. So, we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassured that ventilators are there for them as they move through the curve. I think to date we’ve been able to do that. That’s what’s important to me is that people have what they need when they need it and to date people who have needed ventilators have been able to get on ventilators. I think that’s our goal with governors and with the mayors to make sure that continues to happen. But that means all of us have to work together. I think that’s what’s been really important over the last few weeks is people are not making generic requests anymore. They’re making data-driven requests because they know precisely what’s happening in their hospitals."
2020-04-02,01:56:01,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Burke, when you were up here a little bit ago, you talked about the curve and what you’re seeing and your concern that people are not abiding by the social distancing guidelines. You seemed in your voice to be quite concerned about that. Has the curve changed enough at this point where that 100,000 to 240,000 people likely to die, has that shifted upwards at all?"
2020-04-02,01:56:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"No, it’s just when I look at … so, we’re in week 2.2 in our guidelines and I guess what I expected when the president put out guidelines that said don’t go to bars. Don’t be in groups more than 10 people. When we said that now over 16 days ago, that was serious. Then, you could see what happened subsequently and you can see the number of individuals who have been infected since then, because the people we’re seeing infected today and in hospitals today, were infected after the guidelines went out. So, that’s what we’re worried about and we’re worried that we’re still in this and that’s why the president extended it for 30 days. But we have to get out of this. We have to start seeing this."
2020-04-02,01:57:21,Donald Trump,"But Deborah, aren’t you referring to just a few states because many of those States are dead flat? [crosstalk 01:57:28]"
2020-04-02,01:57:28,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yes. There are states that are dead flat, but what changes the curve is a new Detroit, a new Chicago, a new New Orleans, a new Colorado. Those change the curves because it all of a sudden spikes with the number of new cases because you have a certain projection of new cases and then a whole nother city comes on top where they’re in their logarithmic phase. So, those ones that I talked about that had test results greater than 13% positive, all of those states or all of those counties are in logarithmic phase."
2020-04-02,01:58:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That means there are a lot of counties that aren’t and we’re excited about those counties that have been testing and still finding quite flat and hopefully, maybe Sunday or so or sometime this weekend we can go through all the states and the curves again. So you can see where, that California and Washington are still steady, but we’re watching very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly and this should not be happening any longer in new places if people are doing this social distancing, washing their hands, not getting together in large groups more than 10."
2020-04-02,01:58:54,Donald Trump,"But, again, I look at the graphs all the time and you have many, many flatliners. I call them flatliners. I’m amazed at that. And you have a couple that are up. It’s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job."
2020-04-02,01:59:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"No, no, I don’t want to say that. No, don’t … No thank you, sir. In fact, I want to praise the States and I want to be able to call them out and show you their graphs so you can see. They’ve had steady small cases. They’re testing and they’re doing a lot of testing and their percent of test positives are under 5%. I mean, we have a whole group of States who are testing, and their positivity rate is under 5%. We know what it looks like on the logarithmic curve. You’re in the 13%, then 15%, then 26%, and then 35%. That’s what we’re trying to prevent and it’s the metro areas that are absolutely crucial in this. So, if you’re in a Metro area or you’re in a small city, please make sure all of your friends and family are following the guidelines. That’s the best thing we can do."
2020-04-02,02:00:03,Donald Trump,"Yeah, because I saw those pens going five minutes ago. They were thrilled. The fact is, yes, we compare them to Italy, one place, and we have many places that are really doing, and I think that’s what Deborah meant. She didn’t mean all of them, so when you write your story tomorrow, maybe you’ll write it correctly. She was talking about one state and another state is having a hard time and they’re closely associated. By the way, the people are doing a very good job, including the people that live there. But, when Deborah was talking about Italy, she was talking about the one and then the other was lower and then you have mostly states that have been unbelievable. So, she wasn’t talking about the average of everything."
2020-04-02,02:00:47,Donald Trump,"She was talking about an individual state, which is, I think, still better than Italy. Italy is having a hard time. By the way, Spain is having a hard time. France is having a hard time, but our states, generally speaking, it’s like lots of different countries all over. Many of those countries are doing a phenomenal job. They’re really flat and I think that’s what you meant."
2020-04-02,02:01:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, sir."
2020-04-02,02:01:12,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. I don’t want to speak for her. [crosstalk 02:01:13] But that’s what I understood she meant. Yeah, please."
2020-04-02,02:01:17,Unnamed (Reporter),"I have a question about that though because Coronavirus is present in all 50 States. Before, when you implored mayors and governors to be serious about this, you said once it shows up, mitigation efforts are too late. So, how do you then square that with this notion that some states are doing well? I mean, the virus doesn’t abide by United States laws."
2020-04-02,02:01:35,Donald Trump,"Because some states they stay in better, they’re not touching, whatever it is. They’re not going out. They’re not in groups and some states are not probably as good for whatever reason, or they also live a lot closer. New York is very dense, and California is pretty dense too and they’ve got a very good record going so far. We hope it doesn’t spike up, but it’s very flat. We have states that are doing incredibly well. When I looked at some of them, I looked at some states that I would’ve thought maybe wouldn’t have done as well, and they’re really flatlined. Hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way. [crosstalk 02:02:11]"
2020-04-02,02:02:12,Unnamed (Reporter),"Sir, isn’t that the point, that you want those states to stay flatlined?"
2020-04-02,02:02:15,Donald Trump,"I want them. That’s what I’m saying. No. But when Debra mentioned about Italy and our country, she wasn’t referring to our country. She was referring to one state."
2020-04-02,02:02:25,Unnamed (Reporter),She’s encouraging people to do a better job of following these social distancing measures. That’s what I’m understanding.
2020-04-02,02:02:32,Donald Trump,"Okay, so my understanding … I’m going to let her say it, but I think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most States are doing. Thrilled."
2020-04-02,02:02:41,Unnamed (Reporter),I don’t think she said … is that what you meant?
2020-04-02,02:02:43,Donald Trump,"The flatline states, states that have almost no bump. I mean, I would think … now, then you others where for whatever reason, they’re higher. That’s different, but you can’t condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there’s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to Italy where they have some very unique problems. In all fairness to Italy, they have some very unique problems. But if you’d like to come up and-"
2020-04-02,02:03:09,Unnamed (Reporter),"So, how many flatline do we have and how many-"
2020-04-02,02:03:12,Donald Trump,A lot of them.
2020-04-02,02:03:13,Unnamed (Reporter),How many do we have?
2020-04-02,02:03:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, why don’t I bring you the whole deck again and we’ll divide out the states so you can see them? Because you really have to see each state separately. That’s why I started with, there are states where you’ve heard me talk about how concerned I was. These are states that, before the guidelines went out or right after the guidelines went out, I mean you can look at … it’s on the website. If you go to the health data.org about when governors made clarity about closing their states as far as the social distancing, the washing of the hands, the bars, doing takeout, and you can line that up with the presidential guidelines. And not all states, when the presidential guidelines came out, immediately followed the presidential guidelines. Not all states did. There are states that also may have gotten many more seeds from outside communities."
2020-04-02,02:04:12,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That certainly is one of the issues that New York and New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island are facing. The virus came in from multiple places into those states. It was undetected early on and they have a very logarithmic curve. What I’m saying is even one of those curves in one county, in one city, is one curve too many. So, I am passionate about everyone following the guidelines because of the outlier curves. Maybe that was a better way of putting it."
2020-04-02,02:04:46,Donald Trump,That’s exactly … I think that’s perfect.
2020-04-02,02:04:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,The outlier curves in specific counties is to make sure that doesn’t happen anywhere else.
2020-04-02,02:04:53,Unnamed (Reporter),"So, would you feel better if every state did a stay at home order? Would you feel better?"
2020-04-02,02:04:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think most of the states have done that. I think if you … one death from this is one death too many. I mean, I come out of epidemics and pandemics. We know what to do. I know we don’t have a vaccine and I know we don’t have a therapeutic, but we know what can be done and others are doing it and most of the people in the United States are doing it."
2020-04-02,02:05:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It’s our communities. It’s every American that has to make these changes and I know they’re really hard and I know it’s hard to remember. I mean, I have to say to myself every day because I’m around very important people to never touch anything. And I’m just like paranoid now about touching things. I’m sure you all are too. I mean, we’ve gotten to the place where we don’t go to your places on Pebble Beach, we go to the one that’s open-aired because I mean you’re trying to protect your reporters. I mean, I understand that. We’re all trying to protect each other, and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we’re in right now."
2020-04-02,02:06:02,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I believe everybody is trying really hard and I’m just asking them to try really, really hard for these next 28 days because they will make a tremendous difference. We see that evidence. So, it’s like having a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what works and we’re asking everybody to apply what works. I know it takes amazing attention to detail because the minute you forget or do something, you’re like, “Oh my gosh. I should’ve never done that.” And that’s the level of attention it takes."
2020-04-02,02:06:33,Unnamed (Reporter),If covering our faces could help us do that-
2020-04-02,02:06:35,Donald Trump,"So, I just want to say, many states have started low and slow and then they stayed at a good level. Some really stayed at a great level. Louisiana’s an example. It was low and slow, and they were looking great. I was watching it because it’s a place people go to with Mardi Gras, which is an interesting point because after Mardi Gras it was low and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly and now it’s one of our true hotspots. Certain areas of Michigan. Detroit looked like it was doing pretty good and then all of a sudden it went up. So, you have that too. But I’ll tell you what, we have states that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so low. You haven’t seen the bump and I hope you don’t. I hope you don’t."
2020-04-02,02:07:27,Donald Trump,"And you have a couple that, for a lot of different reasons, and that’s not to blame anybody, but they are at a higher level. But very few. I think, Deborah, I mean, I may say, I think most people have actually followed the presidential you can call them whatever you want. I would never use the word dictates because if I used that word I would be in such trouble. In fact, you’ll put me in trouble just that I even mentioned the thought of it. But we make a recommendation and I think they’ve done a good job. Maybe they started a little later, but maybe they’re also more difficult states. But we’ve done I think on average really phenomenally as a country. I think we’ve done phenomenally because when you looked at that graph the other day, I don’t know if you saw it, I assume you saw it."
2020-04-02,02:08:11,Donald Trump,"Everybody in the world saw it, but you look at all those lines on the bottom, one color after another, all different representing different states. It’s all crowded at the bottom. And then you had two that were up. I don’t know, almost every one of them was down low, very low. So, there were a lot of people listening and I just want it clear because I don’t need headlines tomorrow. Neither does the country because I don’t want this country working so hard and then have press, in this case, may be misinterpret something because when I heard it, I was surprised at first too. But I understood what Deborah meant. Because I think it’s very important for you to be accurate. One other thing, just a quick thing. So, what I found is when governors called me, I think in every case they’ve always been so nice, so nice and I’ve seen them and heard them say “Thank you, very much.”"
2020-04-02,02:09:08,Donald Trump,"“You have done a great job, a fantastic job in one case. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.” Then I’ll see the governor, usually of the opposite party in almost all cases except maybe one, but in almost all cases they’re very generous. They’re very nice. They thank me, everything’s great. We’re doing a great job. And then I’ll see him on television and it’s like a different person. And I realize there are some people, because of politics, that if they say, “We want a thousand ventilators” and I’ll say, “No, Jim. I want to give you 5,000 ventilators.”"
2020-04-02,02:09:42,Donald Trump,"They’ll say, “Thank you. You are the greatest president that’s ever lived.” And then I’ll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show and they’ll say, “The president didn’t come through for me. I’m very disappointed in the president.” And we have a lot of that. They’re very happy when they talk to me, Then I see them. But there are some people, if they asked for 500 of something and if I gave him 5,000, you’ll say, “How’s the president doing?” “Well, we don’t like the job.” To my face they’re very nice. But, then sometimes, I guess they assume I don’t watch them or something, but I watch very closely. Yeah, please."
2020-04-02,02:10:17,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President. One especially vulnerable population is the prison population and, especially with Jared here, I wondered if you could address what the federal government is doing to protect inmates?"
2020-04-02,02:10:27,Donald Trump,"Well, there’s vulnerable and then there’s close together. I can’t tell you about age, but a lot of young people in prison. Some people, some states, I have not done that at all, but some states are letting people out of prison. Some people are getting out that are very serious criminals in some states, and I don’t like that. I don’t like it. But it’s a city or state thing, in certain cases, as you know. I think, maybe Philadelphia comes to mind. So, we’ll have to see what’s going on. We don’t like it. The people don’t like it. And we’re looking in to see if I have the right to stop it in some cases. Okay?"
2020-04-02,02:11:08,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. We haven’t heard of you talk a lot today about what they’re going through."
2020-04-02,02:11:16,Donald Trump,"Oh, I think it’s terrible."
2020-04-02,02:11:16,Unnamed (Reporter),"So, what’s your message to them?"
2020-04-02,02:11:19,Donald Trump,"I think it’s terrible. So, look, four weeks ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest in the world. Greatest in the history of the world. We had the most jobs ever in the history of the United States. Almost 160 million jobs. Right? And then one day, I get a call from Deborah who’s fantastic and from Dr. Fauci and he said, and she said, “We have a problem.” I said, “What’s the problem?” And they said, “We may have to close it up.” I said, “Close what up?” They said, “Close up the country.” I said, “What’s that all about?” And we discussed today and probably not since 1917, came to that conclusion, and she is a fantastic person, a brilliant person, and this is what she knows. I said, “Has it ever been this bad?” And I think I can represent that you said no. And part of it is it’s a contagion."
2020-04-02,02:12:20,Donald Trump,"It’s so contagious. It’s like if you sneeze, I probably get it. Whoever heard of a thing like that? And this very talented reporter is bailing out. He’s out of here. I don’t blame you, but it’s a very contagious thing, probably the likes of which we’ve never seen in terms of that. But 1917, so that’s over a hundred years ago. But it’s been written about many, many times. That was a horrible … whether it was 75 or 100 million people, I’ve heard from 50 to 75 I’ve heard 75 to 100, but it was tens of millions of people. Now, we have the advantage of communication. This could have been just as bad. I mean, here we can read on the internet, we can see what to do, we can have these meetings, they can watch on television, which they do. A lot of people are watching. A lot of people are watching, and they say, “Gee, social distancing.”"
2020-04-02,02:13:15,Donald Trump,"But in 1917 they didn’t have that option. They didn’t know what to do. They just noticed people were dying all over the place. Think of it. 75 to 100 million people died. A lot of people in this country died. To me, it’s a great question, how come more people didn’t die in this country? And they say it actually started in this country and went to Europe. I mean, we lost a lot of people, but relatively we lost very few compared to Europe. So, this is a terrible thing that happened and what’s happening now with people in jobs. So, think of the position I’m in. We have built all together, everybody, not me, everybody, the greatest economy in history, and all of a sudden people come in that we respect, that we know, and here’s the thing, they were right. Everybody questioned it for a while."
2020-04-02,02:14:08,Donald Trump,"Not everybody, but a good portion questioned it. They said, “Let’s keep it open. Let’s ride it.” If we did that, you saw the other graph, and whether it’s true or almost true or maybe not true enough, the number was 2.2 million people would’ve died. 2.2 million people would’ve died in a short period of time. In fact, the graph could have been even shorter. I always noticed that horrible one where it goes high, it actually comes down a little bit faster. It might’ve been over faster, and you would have lost 2.2 million people. So, they come in and they say, “We have to close up the country.” And I say, “You know what that does to the fabric of this country?” To people that had great jobs, great family, no problems with money? Their 401k, everything is perfect. Then all of a sudden, they go from that to having no job in one day they never even thought of it and then you see 6 million people unemployed."
2020-04-02,02:15:05,Donald Trump,"Unemployment numbers get released and you see 6 million people and it’s an artificial closing. It’s not like we have a massive recession or worse. It’s artificial because we turned it off. Think of what we’re doing. We’re saying, “Don’t go to work and we’ll pay you.” Everything’s the opposite. It was always “Go to work and make a lot of money and do well and the American dream.” Because of a hidden enemy we’re saying, “Don’t go to work and we’re going to pay you.” Look at the money, $2 trillion and we will probably do more. I think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do. You want to get the restaurants back. You give deductibility. You understand what that is. You give deductibility for businesses where they go, and they use the restaurants. The restaurants will be bigger and better than they were before."
2020-04-02,02:15:54,Donald Trump,"People don’t know, a lot of restaurants closed when they ended deductibility and then they started doing well, but they had fewer restaurants. But the boom of the restaurants is when they had deductibility, where corporations could use them. And entertainment, that was a great thing, but they closed it and then they closed it again and it wasn’t the same. But you want to get them back. You do that. But infrastructure, we borrow our money now at zero. If we were paying 5%, 4%, 3% it’s a different ball game. We can borrow long-term for zero. Literally zero. You know that because we’re considered the safe investment all over the world. They want money in the United States. That’s where they want the money. So, I know better than anybody. I know what they’re going through and it’s horrible, but you know what I want to do?"
2020-04-02,02:16:45,Donald Trump,"I want to be able to get them back fast. When this is over, it’s going to be a day we’re going to celebrate because everyone’s going to go to work and I think we’re going to have boom times. I think it’s going to be great, and we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned about borders; we’ve learned about reliance on other countries. We’ve learned so much that I think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger, and I think it’s going to come back very quickly, but first we have to defeat this enemy, so we will see you tomorrow. Thank you very much."
2020-04-03,00:00,Donald Trump,"With Kevin McCarthy, future speaker of the house, I hope. And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California. And also the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you take a look at the bump, and how they’re doing out there. I congratulate everybody out there, but I thought I’d have Kevin say a few words. So Kevin, please."
2020-04-03,00:27,Kevin McCarthy,"Well thank you Mr. President and I would like to thank you. I’m [inaudible 00:00:36]. Governor Newsom says the work that you’re doing together, you’ve been working very closely, has been effective in California. As well, Vice President and the President. You know today, Mr. President, I want to thank you, especially, for the work as Secretary Mnuchin has done especially for small businesses. Just today alone, I saw Bank of America had more than 10,000 loans in two hours. For anybody who’s in small business, my first small business when I was 20 years old, you don’t have income coming in right now. You get a loan. But for your rent, paying your employees, and paying your utilities is a grant. That’s part of the Cares Act. And I think you’re going to find that a lot of small businesses are going to hire people back, keep them afloat through the next two months and get this economy moving again as we get through this virus. So I just want to thank you for all that."
2020-04-03,01:20,Donald Trump,Great job you’re doing. Thank you.
2020-04-03,01:22,Kevin McCarthy,Thank you.
2020-04-03,01:22,Donald Trump,You go ahead. I’ll talk to you later.
2020-04-03,01:24,Kevin McCarthy,All right.
2020-04-03,01:28,Donald Trump,"Okay. Thank you very much everybody. And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America. That seems to be the hotspot right now. But you have some others as you know, that are very bad, very bad. Louisiana is getting hit very hard. Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard. New Jersey is surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought. They’re doing a really good job. Governor is doing a really good job out there."
2020-04-03,02:03,Donald Trump,"New York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure. They’re the best in the world. We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource, financial, medical, scientific, we will not spare anything. We’ll get it back into shape. The Empire State, the governor’s doing an excellent job. They’re all working very hard together. At the request of the Governor, as you know, the Javits Center… We have 2,500 beds and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after. The patients can be looked after. That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents. It’s very interesting, the Governor is telling me, “We don’t have too many accidents, very few people driving.” So we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility. The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them."
2020-04-03,03:12,Donald Trump,"And today also the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus. From recent studies we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood. So, you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred. In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of nonmedical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary, you don’t have to do. They suggested for a period of time, but this is voluntary."
2020-04-03,03:55,Donald Trump,"I don’t think I’m going to be doing it, but you have a lot of ways you can look at it as follows. The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home, probably material that you’d have at home. These face coverings can be easily washed or reused. I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical grade or surgical grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job. Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services. The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time. Again, we’re going to all come back together here. We’re going all come back together. And, practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway."
2020-04-03,04:59,Donald Trump,"A lot of things I think are going to spill over. Shaking hands, maybe, will stay with our country for a long time beyond this. One of our great doctors was telling me that, as you know, we have flus every year and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial. He said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower. So maybe some of these things, longterm, will be good. But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection."
2020-04-03,05:36,Donald Trump,"So with the masks it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it, you don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it and that’s okay. It may be good, probably will. They’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation, it’s voluntary."
2020-04-03,05:54,Donald Trump,"We’ve also taken action to ensure no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus. The largest insurer nationwide, the Blue Cross Blue Shield system, has now announced that it will not require any copays, which is really something, that’s a tremendous statement, from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days. Similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem. Those are great companies and they’re all doing the same thing. So copays, for them to do that is a big statement. We appreciate it."
2020-04-03,06:33,Donald Trump,"Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the Economic Relief Package congress passed last month. That was as per the question yesterday, and actually the day before yesterday. This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment. So that, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people."
2020-04-03,07:10,Donald Trump,"I’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers. The Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment. We need these items immediately for domestic use, we have to have them. But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items and you’ll be hearing about that shortly."
2020-04-03,07:48,Donald Trump,"We’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies. Under that authority, this week the Department of Health and Human Services working with the Department of Justice took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves. As well as bottles, many, many, many bottles and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded. All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers, most of it’s already been given out. And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot to New Jersey, a lot to other places."
2020-04-03,08:29,Donald Trump,"In addition, to ensure that health care workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government in the name of the Department of Defense is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators, Department of Defense. And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City. Mayor De Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor De Blasio in New York City and they were very grateful. 8.1 million, and we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more. That’s a lot of N95 respirators."
2020-04-03,09:11,Donald Trump,"Today my team spoke with the CEO of Oschner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans. They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators. I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators, and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them. The CEO of Oschner, Warner Thomas, who’s really been fantastic I have to say, indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns and I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow. That’s Louisiana, New Orleans. 230,000 surgical gowns, they’ll have them by tomorrow. We’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military. And we are in a war, the invisible enemy, remember. Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country. Like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits where we’ve taken over. And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get more people in the New York area. So we’re going to have it manned by the military, Javits Center."
2020-04-03,10:44,Donald Trump,"National Guard members have been activated to help States build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies. That includes National Guard. The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the States were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies. So I’ve given approval to use the National Guard, the various National Guards in the different States. And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people, but delivering material."
2020-04-03,11:23,Donald Trump,"The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 States and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many States. In New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Ohio. They’re doing a lot of work in just those States, plus additionals that will be announced probably tomorrow, but they’re doing some job. The Army Corps of Engineers, what a job they’re doing. And FEMA, what a job they’re doing."
2020-04-03,12:01,Donald Trump,"As we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers. We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies in the treatment and prevention of the virus. We will keep the American people fully informed in our findings. Hydroxychloroquine, I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results. I hope that, that would be a phenomenal thing. But we have it right now in, approximately, it’s increased to 1,500 people. I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York, terrific guy by the way, he’s doing a good job. And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it. It’s been there for about three and a half days and many other places it’s being tested, too. And we have a tremendous supply of it. We’ve ordered it in the case that it works, and it could have some pretty big impacts. We’ll see what happens."
2020-04-03,13:07,Donald Trump,"My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses. In day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5 billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during this unprecedented time. Bank of America has been incredible. Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks, and we’re already at three point $5 billion going out to incredible people. But that’s way ahead of schedule."
2020-04-03,13:47,Donald Trump,"The SBA and the treasury are working around the clock. And our banking partners are really incredible, and they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible. And then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go. And now they’ll keep them, and that’s good. Then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees, and we’ll try and get back to where we were. Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were."
2020-04-03,14:15,Donald Trump,"The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis. This afternoon I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hagar of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicky Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of ExxonMobil. I informed them that we will be making space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time. There’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus. The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil. So we’re working with our great energy companies. These are great companies. They employee tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. They’ve kept America really going for a long time, and no big price hikes, no big anything. I mean, they’ve just kept it going and now they got hit. But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape."
2020-04-03,15:35,Donald Trump,"America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society. Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time. We want them to stay healthy for a long time, so stay at home. This is ending, this will end. You’ll see some bad things, and then you’re going to see some really good things and it’s not going to be too long."
2020-04-03,16:04,Donald Trump,"We will heal our citizens, and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus. And with that I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up. Vice-President, say a few words. And we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we’ll take questions."
2020-04-03,16:26,Donald Trump,"It’s a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C. and our country’s a great place. And we’re getting better, we’re getting better very quickly. This was artificially induced, they said, “Close it down, you have to close it down.” We closed it down and we’re healing, and we’re going to get it better fast. So Mike, if you could come up and say a few words, please."
2020-04-03,16:52,Mike Pence,"Thank you., Mr. President. The President just outlined a number of the decisions that he made today on the unanimous recommendation of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. In addition, some good news Dr. Deborah Birx will reflect on in a moment, on some of the areas across America where we see evidence that the mitigation efforts, the American people putting into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines are having a positive effect. In fact today, California and Washington State where the coronavirus first emerged in our country, the cases remain at a steady but low rate. We know, as Governor Newsom said yesterday, that they’re not out of the woods yet. We continue to flow resources. But we want to commend people in those States and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing, and all the measures that State and local leaders are advising, and that the President has been advising in the coronavirus guidelines for America."
2020-04-03,17:59,Mike Pence,"We’re also continuing to track significant outbreaks in New York State, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, and Boston. And as the President indicated, we’re prioritizing resources to support health care workers and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those communities."
2020-04-03,18:16,Mike Pence,"On the subject of testing, now more than 1.4 million tests have been performed across the country. And as you all are aware, some 266,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus. Abbott Instruments, which now can perform a 15 minute test across the country, have literally 18,000 of their machines across the nation today. But at the President’s direction, FEMA is acquiring over 1200 more machines to distribute to every State public health lab in America and also to our Indian Healthcare and Service."
2020-04-03,18:56,Mike Pence,"And the big news, of course, over the last few days was that the FDA, once again in near record time, has approved an antibody. A test developed by SELEX. And we’re continuing on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to examine ways that we can scale up these rapid tests, and these innovative new tests. Not just to meet this moment, but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the months ahead."
2020-04-03,19:22,Mike Pence,"As President mentioned, he met with energy executives today and continues to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation. We also held a teleconference today with commercial retailers. On the President’s behalf we thanked them for the way that people that operate malls and shopping centers around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guidelines for America. It’s had enormous impact on their businesses and their industries. But I heard from them their patriotic commitment with the health of their associates and their customers first. And it was deeply-"
2020-04-03,20:03,Mike Pence,"Put the health of their associates and their customers first and it was deeply inspiring. On the subject of supplies, the president detailed our work in that space. It continues to this day. Part of our air bridge, we had a flight arrive from China today to Columbus, Ohio. We continue to work each and every day watching the data about cases to ensure that in particular, not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare workers that are on the front lines, but also that ventilators are available as this epidemic makes its way through regions and communities. We are literally working hour by hour, day by day, to make sure that patients, families and healthcare providers have the equipment and the support that they need."
2020-04-03,20:50,Mike Pence,"As the president mentioned, we’ve seen over a billion and a half dollars in loans go out through the paycheck protection program today. We have available for questions the head of the CDC today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face coverings and Secretary Azar, in a few moments, will explain just how the president’s decision to make sure that no American will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment."
2020-04-03,21:22,Mike Pence,"I’m pleased to report that the president’s direction, Medicaid and Medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on. Of course the president just indicated how major insurance companies across the country are not just waiving copays on testing, but they’re now waiving copays for at least 60 days on any coronavirus treatment. Now Secretary Azar will enumerate on how we’ll make sure that any American, even those that have no insurance, will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill."
2020-04-03,21:57,Mike Pence,"I just give a gentle reminder to every American that there is evidence across the country that you’re putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America. Every American has a role to play and I want to thank you on behalf of the president and all of the American people for the way that you’re stepping forward. You’re engaging in the social distancing and doing the things that will slow the spread. We encourage you to keep on keeping on. We will get through this, America. We will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health, renewed prosperity that the president always describes. But we’ll get through there sooner and we’ll get through there when we work together."
2020-04-03,22:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President. Thank you for your words of discipline and determination. I guess that really describes what we’re asking every American to really be disciplined about these guidelines and really determine to stay in that space of execution. You know, we are just in week three of this full guidance measure. We really do appreciate the work of the citizens of California and Washington state because we do see that their curve is different. Their curve is different from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut and we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those states is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers. We also are deeply grateful that despite the way their curve looks today, they continue to get ready for a different potential, so that they can ensure that patients, if they do get sick, have options and availability."
2020-04-03,23:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"To all the frontline healthcare workers in the what we have referred to as hot zones areas where the number of cases are quite significant. The New Orleans, the New York city metro area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, the incredible work that the front line health care workers are providing. We’ve really working now at a much more granular level, talking directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supplies that they need in coordination with state and local governments. I think we discussed it yesterday, but I think it was quite clear, also, and reiterated by Governor Cuomo today, that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas and other areas move through their peak of new infections."
2020-04-03,24:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,"When we talked about it at the beginning of this week, we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult and we want to recognize the number of Americans who have lost their lives to this virus and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers are making both in their care, but I think I’m very uplifted by hearing their messages to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital."
2020-04-03,25:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We continue to watch, in addition, the Chicago area, the Detroit area, and have some developing concerns around Colorado, the District of Columbia and Pennsylvania. As you can see, each of these will follow their own curves. We’ll be getting more and more of those case over time information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curves as each of these states, counties and communities move through this together in solidarity. And really ensuring that we can move supplies creatively around the country to meet the needs of both the frontline healthcare providers, but also every American who needs our support right now. Thank you."
2020-04-03,26:00,Unnamed,Thank you very much.
2020-04-03,26:05,Alex Azar,"Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your continued leadership as we battle the coronavirus. First, I want to thank all of the members of the HHS team and the frontline healthcare workers across America, including those service workers who serve in our hospitals and our health care facilities. Those who clean, those who deliver, those who stock the shelves, all those who are going into battle every day against the virus. Your country’s asked you to serve as never before and you have responded heroically. I’m going to provide a brief update on the administration’s plans to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured. Getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for President Trump. We are already rolling out the $1 billion in funding from the Families first Coronavirus Response Act to cover provider’s expenses for testing and diagnosing the uninsured. The CARES Act signed by the president includes another $100 billion for healthcare providers."
2020-04-03,27:08,Alex Azar,"Under the president’s direction, we will use a portion of that funding to cover provider’s costs of delivering COVID-19 care for the uninsured, sending the money to providers through the same mechanism used for testing. As a condition of receiving funds under this program, providers will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care. Providers will be reimbursed at Medicare rates. We will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the $100 billion will go to providers. We’re working to ensure that this funding is distributed in a way that is fast, fair, simple and transparent. I’d also like to remind people that if you’ve lost employer insurance coverage, you have insurance options that you should look into. You’d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchanges, and depending on your state, you may be eligible for Medicaid."
2020-04-03,28:10,Alex Azar,"Just as President Trump is working to ensure that COVID-19 treatment is paid for, he’s working to support new treatment options for patients. Thanks to the president’s leadership, many providers are trying different experimental therapies and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments are working. Today, Oracle has developed and is donating to the government and the American people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced realtime information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics. While this doesn’t replace the important work of clinical trials, it gives us data rapidly. If you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us, you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work. There’s a special registration page for providers@covid19.oracle.com. Thank you very much."
2020-04-03,29:10,Donald Trump,Okay. Let’s go. Steve?
2020-04-03,29:12,Unnamed,If we could draw you out a little bit more advice on face mask. What would people gain from wearing a mask and why are you opposed to wearing one yourself?
2020-04-03,29:21,Donald Trump,"I just don’t want to wear one myself. It’s a recommendation. They recommend it. I’m feeling good. I just don’t want to be doing, I don’t know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk. I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. I don’t know, somehow I don’t see it for myself. Maybe I’ll change my mind, but this will pass and hopefully it’ll pass very quickly."
2020-04-03,29:55,Donald Trump,"Now, with that being said, if somebody wants to… I mean most people can just make something out of a certain material, so it’s very well designated. It’s very simple to do. I won’t be doing it personally. It’s a recommendation. Okay?"
2020-04-03,30:12,Unnamed,Would you like to say something about that?
2020-04-03,30:14,Jerome Adams,"Sure, absolutely."
2020-04-03,30:15,Donald Trump,"Surgeon General, please."
2020-04-03,30:20,Jerome Adams,"Thank you. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Secretary, and CDC Director Redfield. I especially want to thank the folks at the CDC and it’s a great question that you ask. It’s a fair question that you ask. I want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on masks because it has been confusing to the American people. First of all, I want people to understand that the CDC, the World Health Organization, my office, and most public health and health organizations and professionals originally recommended against the general public wearing masks because based on the best evidence available at the time, it was not deemed that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wearing a mask would contract COVID-19. We have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you’re coughing, if you have a fever, if you’re symptomatic, you could transmit the disease to other people."
2020-04-03,31:17,Jerome Adams,"What has changed in our recommendation? Well, it’s important to know that we now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms. They’re what we call asymptomatic, and that even those who eventually become presymptomatic, meaning that they will develop symptoms in the future, can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, for example, coughing, speaking or sneezing, even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends and the Task Force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These include places like grocery stores and pharmacies. We especially recommend this in areas of significant community based transmission."
2020-04-03,32:14,Jerome Adams,"It is critical and the president mentioned this, the vice president mentioned this. It’s critical to emphasize that maintaining six feet of social distancing remains key to slowing the spread of the virus, but CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth coverings to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical master N95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders as recommended by the current CDC guidance. As the president also mentioned, cloth face covering fashioned from household items are made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional voluntary public health measure. This recommendation compliments and does not replace the president’s coronavirus guidelines for America 30 days to slow the spread, which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus."
2020-04-03,33:15,Jerome Adams,"CDC is always, always looking at the data. We’ve told you that from the beginning. Dr. Burke said that every single press conference, we’re looking at the data, we’re evolving our recommendations, and new recommendations will come as the evidence dictates. I want to say, if you do choose to wear a face mask, very important, wash your hands first because you don’t want to put on a face covering with a dirty hand. Do not touch your face while you are wearing the face covering because again, you could take materials from the surface, germs from the surface, and bring it to your face. If you choose to wear a face covering, please, please leave the N95 masks, the medical supplies, for the medical professionals, healthcare workers and frontline workers. Know that this is not a substitute for social distancing."
2020-04-03,34:04,Jerome Adams,"Remember, this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me. This is about us coming together as communities and if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering, they’re wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting the coronavirus because again, they could have asymptomatic spread. Mr. President, thank you very much for that. Appreciate the opportunity to come."
2020-04-03,34:29,Donald Trump,Okay.
2020-04-03,34:31,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Dr. Fauci last night recommended, said that every state should have stay at home orders right now. Do you agree with that? Should every state in this country have the kind of stay at home owners that we now see in places like Washington?"
2020-04-03,34:43,Donald Trump,"I’d talk to the governors. The governors know what they’re doing, they’ve been doing a great job. I guess we’re close to 90% anyway. The states that we’re talking about are not in jeopardy. No, I would leave it to the governors. I like that from the standpoint of governing and I like that from the standpoint of even our Constitution."
2020-04-03,35:02,Unnamed,"Mr. President, to address the shortage in the blood supply, the Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday-"
2020-04-03,35:10,Donald Trump,"I pointed at you. I heard a different voice, I heard a much different voice. We’ll get you later."
2020-04-03,35:15,Unnamed,"Going to the oil meeting previously, is the US willing to cut domestic oil production? What came out of the meeting? What was the consensus?"
2020-04-03,35:22,Donald Trump,"Well, a lot of things came out. It’s a great industry. It’s an important industry. It’s a tremendous job-producing industry and it’s just vital. It was also a very interesting because they all would get the test before they came into the room. You have the head of ExxonMobil, you have all these guys taking the test and they all passed with flying colors. That was good. They left happy in that respect, at least. There’s just an overabundance of oil right now. Oil and gas, tremendous overabundance and it was caused… They were doing a great job. They were producing a lot of energy, but then you had the virus come along and it knocked another 35%, maybe 40%, off of the market. There’s too much oil, there’s a glut, and these are great companies and they’ll figure it out. It’s free market. We’ll figure it out."
2020-04-03,36:11,Unnamed,"You spoke to President Putin, I mean what’s on the table here?"
2020-04-03,36:16,Donald Trump,"They were having a competition. We’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out very well. It’s going to take a long time to get rid of that. There’s massive excess amount of oil and gas. Massive, like probably there’s never been. Where that does work out well, I guess you could say, is for drivers. I think in certain locations, it’s down to 90 and 95 cents a gallon right now on the road. But we have a tremendous industry, a great industry. It’s tremendously important industry from the standpoint of jobs and we’re energy independent. We have to make sure we keep it that way. All right, please."
2020-04-03,36:59,Unnamed,"… Then to address this shortage of blood supply, announced yesterday, would ease the restrictions on certain donors, including gay men who are now required to be abstinent for three months as opposed to 12 months to donate. Did you have a hand in that thing?"
2020-04-03,37:10,Donald Trump,Didn’t know anything about that. That was done by the FDA. Very capable people at the FDA.
2020-04-03,37:17,Unnamed,"Yes, Mr. President. Both the government of Canada and 3M are pushing back on this DPA not to export N95 respirators. 3M says-"
2020-04-03,37:28,Donald Trump,"I don’t blame them, they can push back if they want. We’re not happy with 3M. We’re not happy, and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with 3M. We’ll see whether or not we do. I heard what he had to say today. I don’t know the gentleman, but we’re not happy with 3M. Go ahead."
2020-04-03,37:43,Unnamed,Where is Dr. Fauci?
2020-04-03,37:45,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. But every time you asked that question, whenever he’s not here, you look, you say, “Where is he?” And you’ll say, “Is there a problem?” No problem whatsoever. Every time he’s not here. Sometimes I’ll ask him to come because that’s the first question that you and a couple of others from the Fake News Establishment ask is, “Where’s Dr. Fauci?” We’re doing great together. We’re covering a different subject today. Go ahead."
2020-04-03,38:09,Unnamed,"Different subject. Mr. President, you have said, nobody could have seen this pandemic coming, but in fact, Secretary Azar at a biodefense summit in April 2019 said, “Of course the people, of course, the thing that people ask, what keeps you most up at night in the biodefense world? Pandemic flu, of course. I think everyone in this room probably shares that concern.” Your own Health and Human Services secretary was aware that this had the potential of being a very big problem around the world, a pandemic of this nature. Who dropped the ball?"
2020-04-03,38:43,Donald Trump,"Well, I always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things could happen. There’s been nothing like this since probably 1917, that was the big one in Europe. It started actually here and went to Europe, probably. I’ve heard about… Excuse me. Wait a minute. Let me finish. I’ve heard about this for a long time. Pandemics. You don’t want pandemics. I don’t think he was talking about a specific pandemic, he was talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen and it could happen. Most people thought it wouldn’t, and most people didn’t understand the severity of it. This is very severe. What’s happened is very severe, but I’d let you answer that. I assume that he was talking about the concept of a pandemic."
2020-04-03,39:24,Alex Azar,"Thank you, Mr. President. Absolutely. For 15 years now, this country is at a massive effort at the federal, state and local level of preparedness for a pandemic. Now, that largely has been, as I said in those remarks, about pandemic flu preparedness. We knew about SARS, we knew about MERS, which were earlier modifications or variants of the coronavirus. None of those achieved anything like what we’re seeing today, but that’s why four successive presidencies, including the leadership of President Trump, there has been a great focus on pandemic preparedness. In fact, it was just in November, I believe, that the president signed the Pandemic Flu Preparedness Executive."
2020-04-03,40:03,Alex Azar,"… November, I believe, that the president signed the pandemic flu preparedness executive order, and we have also updated the pandemic crisis action plan, which has been the playbook from which we’ve been working. The pandemic flu plan, again, the action plan from which we have been working that coordinates the whole of government, whole of economy approach here. So we’ve all been very focused on pandemic preparedness. That’s what we do. But this particular strain of pandemic, who would have known this particular strain?"
2020-04-03,40:33,Jim Acosta,"Secretary Azar, if you were preparing for a pandemic, if this government were preparing for a pandemic, why is it we don’t have enough masks? Why is it we don’t have enough medical equipment in this country?"
2020-04-03,40:43,Donald Trump,"Previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space. Let me just tell you. You know it. You know the answer. The previous administration, the shelves were empty. The shelves were empty. So what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration, Jim, and ask them that question because the shelves were empty. You know what else? The military shelves were also empty. We had no ammunition, literally, and that was said by one of your favorite generals. Sir, we have no ammunition. Guess what? We had very little medical supply also. All right. Go ahead. We’ll get it back. We’ll get you back. We’ll get you back, please."
2020-04-03,41:26,Jim Acosta,What about that question-
2020-04-03,41:28,Donald Trump,"Jim, I said we’ll get you back. Please go ahead."
2020-04-03,41:30,Unnamed,"So I wanted to ask you about the DPA. So you said that there will be a ban on exporting of all, what does it cover? So masks, gloves, what else?"
2020-04-03,41:37,Donald Trump,It covers everything.
2020-04-03,41:37,Unnamed,Is it in that order? Are you-
2020-04-03,41:39,Donald Trump,"But if somebody ordered, if Italy, if Spain who has big problems, these are countries with tremendous problems. France, if they ordered, if they have long-term orders and they’re in there and they want to get certain things, I’ve let them go out in certain instances because I think it’s only fair. They have problems that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems. So if they ordered something and they’re waiting for, as an example, masks made here and going to Italy, I’m not going to be stopping that. I think it would be very unfair."
2020-04-03,42:09,Donald Trump,"By the way, speaking about being fair and unfair, two very big cruise liners, as you know, I allowed them to dock today. We worked with the governor of Florida, as you know, Ron DeSantis, and we worked on it, and we had tremendous security. We took the sick people, and we’re working with them. We have doctors. We have great doctors, military doctors. From a humane standpoint, not that we’re in love with this, these are two massive ships, but we have to take care of people. We have to take care of them."
2020-04-03,42:40,Donald Trump,"We sent many back to Canada. The Canadians came and worked very closely with us as did the UK. We had a lot of people from the UK, and we took care of the Americans. We took care of the sick. We had some people very sick. I think we had three to four, maybe five people that had died on the boat, one of the boats actually, and we had to take care of these people. So we could have let them float aimlessly into the ocean looking for port as they’ve been doing for a long time, and I made the decision we had to take them in. Homeland Security and a lot of other people did a great job, but we had to help people. These are people that were very, very sick. Some were dying. Some died. Please. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-04-03,43:25,Unnamed,"Your staff today said that people who are in close proximity to you and the vice president will get a Coronavirus test. I’m wondering, are you concerned that the people you’ve been hanging around with may have the virus?"
2020-04-03,43:35,Donald Trump,"No, I’m not concerned. No. I had a test yesterday."
2020-04-03,43:38,Unnamed,"Well, what’s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you. Why [crosstalk 00:43:42]"
2020-04-03,43:41,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. I mean, I heard from the oil executives. These are people, most of them had not had the test, and frankly I think they left the room feeling good about a lot of things, but they felt good about the test. This was a test that took, I guess, 13 minutes to have it finalized. They took the test. I don’t know. I didn’t know they were doing that. Maybe they did it just for them. I don’t know. But it seems that a lot of people, because now we have tests that really work well. Abbott, in this case Abbott. We have other tests being developed right now that are also fantastic. The original tests, the ones we inherited, Jim, as an example, they were broken. They were obsolete. They were not good tests, and that’s what we got stuck with. We’ve developed some incredible tests, but this took 13 to 15 minutes, and they were all fine. Go ahead. Finish your question."
2020-04-03,44:29,Unnamed,"The problem some people have raised is that if the US stopped exporting, what you could have is other countries then deciding reciprocally that they are going to stop exporting and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supplies that American doctors, American hospitals have. How do you address that?"
2020-04-03,44:44,Donald Trump,"Well, I address it in the following manner. We really are very well supplied. We are not the principal. It’s the hospitals, the states, the cities, they’re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens. But nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened. So we started supplying. We brought tremendous amounts to New York today and over the last few days. We brought them to Louisiana. We brought them to Michigan. We brought them to Los Angeles. A lot of equipment."
2020-04-03,45:16,Donald Trump,"You’ve read the amount of masks that we had. I think I said over 8 million masks. The n95 masks, the more expensive, more complicated, better, whatever masks, the ones they want to use in the hospitals, we have millions of them now. We’ve given them to a lot. We sent to Bellevue in New York today. That was from Mayor de Blasio? 200,000 of them, but we have 8.1 million."
2020-04-03,45:45,Donald Trump,"We’re going to have more than that and we’re getting them from various sources, including the military. We’re rapidly then replacing them because we have to replace them in case there’s another emergency. Gowns too. We have many gowns being delivered and have been delivered. Our people have done an incredible job. Most people have said, and I said this yesterday, governors have said thank you very much. Great job. If they’re a Democrat governor, in some cases, not in all cases at all."
2020-04-03,46:14,Donald Trump,"If I said, “Here’s 1000 ventilators. How many do you want?” “We want 1000.” “Here’s 1000. You got them. But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to add another 5,000. Is that good?” They said, “Wow, that’s great.” Then if Jim Acosta goes and says, “Are you happy with the president?” “No, he should have given us 10,000.” That’s what’s happening. You know why? Because that’s a standard political answer, and that’s a shame because we have done a job like nobody’s ever done a job. But we’ve just delivered a lot of masks. We’ve just delivered a lot of gowns and protective gear. But you’re talking about a massive number. But as of this morning, people were very, very happy. Steve?"
2020-04-03,46:54,Steve (Reporter),Did oil executives ask you for a bailout of any sort?
2020-04-03,46:56,Donald Trump,"No, they didn’t ask for a bailout, no."
2020-04-03,46:58,Steve (Reporter),What did they ask for?
2020-04-03,47:01,Donald Trump,"It was really more of a discussion than asking. We did discuss the concept of tariffs because, as you know, this was a dispute among a couple of countries that I think they want to be able to get it solved. They had a dispute. They had a competition, but they want to get it resolved. Russia and Saudi Arabia, I think they want to get it-"
2020-04-03,47:24,Steve (Reporter),Russia and Saudi Arabia?
2020-04-03,47:24,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I think they want to get it resolved. I think they’re working very hard. I mean, they told me they want to get it resolved. They’re working very hard. Go ahead."
2020-04-03,47:30,Unnamed,"Thank you. Yesterday Jared Kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile was, it’s supposed to be our stockpile. It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use. What did he mean by our?"
2020-04-03,47:44,Donald Trump,What are you asking?
2020-04-03,47:45,Unnamed,Even the fact that taxpayers from every state pays for it.
2020-04-03,47:47,Donald Trump,What’s that? A got you? I got you. You used the word our.
2020-04-03,47:50,Unnamed,"No, it’s not a got you."
2020-04-03,47:50,Donald Trump,"Our, you know what our means? United States of America. That’s what it means."
2020-04-03,47:52,Unnamed,What about the states?
2020-04-03,47:55,Donald Trump,"Our. Our. It means the United States of America. Then we take that our, and we distribute it to the states. Not that we have to-"
2020-04-03,48:02,Unnamed,So why did you say it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use?
2020-04-03,48:06,Donald Trump,"Because we need it for the government, and we need it for the federal government. But when the states are in-"
2020-04-03,48:12,Unnamed,To give to the states.
2020-04-03,48:12,Donald Trump,No to also keep-
2020-04-03,48:14,Unnamed,Then who are you giving it to if it’s not to the states?
2020-04-03,48:16,Donald Trump,"To keep for our country because the federal government needs it too, not just the states. But out of that, we oftentimes choose. As an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators, and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We’re going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says our, he’s talking about our country. He’s talking-"
2020-04-03,48:37,Unnamed,"He makes a distinction, and sir-"
2020-04-03,48:37,Donald Trump,"Excuse me. He’s talking about the federal government. I mean, it’s such a basic, simple question, and you try and make it sound so bad."
2020-04-03,48:45,Unnamed,It’s not bad. I’m just trying to understand.
2020-04-03,48:46,Donald Trump,You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
2020-04-03,48:47,Unnamed,"No, by the way, Secretary Azar-"
2020-04-03,48:48,Donald Trump,"You know what? You ought to be ashamed. It’s such a simple question. He said our, and our means for the country and our means [crosstalk 00:48:58] for the states because the states are part of the country. Don’t make it sound bad. Don’t make it sound bad. Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead. Back here."
2020-04-03,49:07,Unnamed,Maybe just even change the language on the website.
2020-04-03,49:07,Donald Trump,You just asked your question. You just asked your question in a very nasty tone. Let’s go.
2020-04-03,49:13,Unnamed,You didn’t give me an answer.
2020-04-03,49:14,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-04-03,49:14,Unnamed,Mr. President-
2020-04-03,49:15,Donald Trump,I gave you a perfect answer. You know it. Go ahead.
2020-04-03,49:17,Unnamed,"Well, just to follow up on that, when we have the federal stockpile, I mean, isn’t that designed to be able to distribute to the states if needed?"
2020-04-03,49:28,Donald Trump,"Sure, but it’s also needed for the federal government. We have a federal stockpile, and they have state stockpiles, and frankly they were, many of the states were totally unprepared for this. So we had to go into the federal stockpile, but we’re not an ordering clerk. They have to have for themselves. Now some of the states were in good shape. Some of the states were not in good shape. That’s probably something you could expect."
2020-04-03,49:51,Donald Trump,"We have been helping states. We have been spending a tremendous amount of time, effort and billions and billions of dollars on making sure that they have what they have. I mean, take New York. We built them hospitals. I built them four hospitals, built them medical centers, sent a ship with 1,000 rooms and 12 operating rooms. Then on top of that gave vast numbers of ventilators and vast numbers of surgical gowns, equipment, masks, everything else."
2020-04-03,50:19,Donald Trump,"Now they had a chance to order ventilators over the years. They had a chance to order very big, but they didn’t choose to do it. We were there, and we helped them, and I think the governor of New York is very thankful for the help that we gave. But we have a stockpile. It’s a federal stockpile. We can use that for states, or we can use it for ourselves. We do use it for the federal government. We have a very big federal government. Go ahead."
2020-04-03,50:44,Unnamed,Have you decided not to use your powers to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supplies that are needed?
2020-04-03,50:50,Donald Trump,"We’re not a traffic cop. We’re a humanitarian cop. We help. It’s like the ships. Do you think we wanted to take two big ships into our country that have obvious problems? You know the problems I’m talking about. So I have a decision to make. Do I take them in, or do I save lives? Okay? Do I take them in, or do I save? I decided to take them in."
2020-04-03,51:13,Donald Trump,"We have tremendous protection. We have great doctors there to help the people. They had four or five people that died. That was as of last night. They died on the ships. We took care of it. Now the people are in the process of, and many are already back in Canada. They’re back in the UK, United Kingdom, and many of them were American citizens. Some were very sick. We’re taking care of the sick people. We’re testing all of the others very, very carefully, very, very carefully. They are being tested like you wouldn’t believe, and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe. You know why? Because nobody else would take the ships. Nobody else would take them. So we docked them in, I think, Fort Lauderdale."
2020-04-03,51:58,Unnamed,"Can you tell me why you don’t say, we’re the federal government and there’s a shortage of masks and other things and we’re going to sign off on [crosstalk 00:52:06]"
2020-04-03,52:06,Donald Trump,"We do say that. We say, and we use the act. Excuse me. We do say that, and we use the act. We’ve used it a number of times very powerfully, and a lot of times we don’t have to use it because we say we’re going to use it if you don’t do this or that. Then we also have companies that act incredibly well. We have plenty of them, mostly them, but we’ve used the act very powerfully. A lot of times you don’t have to exercise the act. All you have to do is tell them, “Look, if you don’t do this, we’re going to use the act.” We’ve done a good job with it. Maybe a great job. Yeah."
2020-04-03,52:41,Unnamed,"Mr. President, there are news reports that you want to sign the stimulus checks that are going out here in several months. Is that right? Do you want to sign those?"
2020-04-03,52:48,Donald Trump,"No. Me sign? No. There’s millions of checks. I’m going to sign them? No. It’s a Trump administration initiative, but do I want to sign them? No. The people are getting their money. There’s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different ways. There’s also a stimulus going for companies that, if it weren’t for our government, would not and some companies that were very strong a month ago."
2020-04-03,53:11,Donald Trump,"Again, we had the strongest economy in the world. We had our best ever. We had probably the best economy in the history of the world, bigger than China, bigger than anybody, and one day we have to say, close it up, stop. Everybody, go home. You know what? It’s pretty tough to do that."
2020-04-03,53:33,Unnamed,That’s another thing. There’s been rumors that these checks may not go out for another four months. If you don’t get [crosstalk 00:53:36].
2020-04-03,53:35,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. All I can tell you is that small business today is that we’re way ahead of schedule. There is a problem, which I pointed out, I said you shouldn’t do it this way, with unemployment, where 40 year old equipment by the states. We’re sending the money to the states. Once the money is sent to the states, then the states, whether they’re Republican or Democrat, have to get the money out to the people. Hopefully they will be able to do it. But many of those states have 40 year old computers. I don’t know that they’re equipped. I wanted to give the money direct if that’s what you’re talking about. I wanted to give the money out direct. It Would have been much easier. But the Democrats and some people said, no, let’s do it the complicated way."
2020-04-03,54:14,Unnamed,I’m talking more about the stimulus checks. When can people get their money by?
2020-04-03,54:17,Donald Trump,All right. Excuse me. I was talking about both. They’ll get it. They will. Go ahead please.
2020-04-03,54:21,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. I’d like to ask questions both for myself and some of the other reporters who are in the room. Social distancing. First of all, and this is for yourself and Dr. Birx, what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point? Is there a way to figure that out? It seems like the antibody test might be able to assist in determining that number."
2020-04-03,54:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, thank you. So while we’re working diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare workers and everyone who is sick gets provided for, at the same time we’re working on tests and assays that will be critical for surveillance and at the same time working on plans for what we need to do as this moves through the population and we get on the downside, which we’re not there yet. Hopefully most of the states will stay, like California and Washington, and then what we need to do to be prepared for fall."
2020-04-03,55:22,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So all three of those things are happening simultaneously, and there’s people working on each one of those work streams. The antibody piece is critical, as you described, because at this time, let’s say symptomatic status is inversely related to age, and so the younger you are, the more likely you are to be asymptomatic. We have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infected."
2020-04-03,55:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So when we talked about five days ago, I think on Monday, I called on universities to work on an ELISA-based test to test their health workers and really get through that. At the same time, the private sector is working on tests. What do we want those tests to be? We want those tests to be like what we use for HIV and malaria. Finger prick onto a cassette. You get a line if you’re positive, and you get a control line. Negative, the line isn’t there and there’s the control line. That’s our dream assay because it’s a finger prick."
2020-04-03,56:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"In the meantime we’re not waiting. I mean, we’re pushing for that. At the same time we’re asking to develop an assay, the ELISA-based assay, which requires a tube of blood. That’s why we’re also talking about could we use dry blood spots. We also put a call directly out to the military because of the Roosevelt to really test all of the sailors on the Roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexisting antibody."
2020-04-03,56:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That would be if the first responders knew they already had had it and they had protective antibody. If the nurses knew, the doctors knew, if your school teacher knew, then it’s a very different dialogue. So we understand the importance of that, and we understand how important it is in relationship to understanding this epidemic."
2020-04-03,57:19,Dr. Deborah Birx,"One other comment because I know we’re always saying who knew what when. I just want to make clear. There’s 150-plus countries working on this collectively together. It’s devastating for every single country. When we get through this, we can go back and look at what happened where and what does this epidemic look like. Then when you get through it, then you can validate every model there is known to man. When you’re in the middle of it, you have to concentrate on serving the needs of each American and what that need looks like."
2020-04-03,57:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"At the same time you have these other work streams on surveillance and how to be prepared both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccine wise for the next fall if it happens again. So I think these things are happening together, but I just want us to really concentrate on the fact that all around the globe, country after country is dealing with this."
2020-04-03,58:20,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We can talk about why didn’t Italy do something or Spain do something or Germany do something, or we can really say, right now we all can do something. We can do the social distancing and all of the pieces that we know is starting to work around the globe in country after country. Then when we get through all of this, we can ask the questions about could we have done some piece of this better as a global community. I will remind you that on February 3rd the head of the WHO said there was no reason to ever do a travel ban. It wasn’t until January 14th that we knew that there was human-to-human transmission."
2020-04-03,59:04,Unnamed,The president was saying this was going to go away. It’s April.
2020-04-03,59:08,Donald Trump,It is going to go away.
2020-04-03,59:08,Unnamed,"But Mr. President, you said it was going to go away in April. You said that one day-"
2020-04-03,59:13,Donald Trump,"I didn’t say a day. I said it’s going away, and it is going away. Okay. Are you … Okay. That was a good answer to your question. No, no, no, no, no, no more. That was a long but a very good answer. That was enough for you."
2020-04-03,59:26,Unnamed,"Mr. President, on the insurance coverage for treatment, when your government is going is trying to make sure that people are covered on the treatment-"
2020-04-03,59:34,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we’re going to do that."
2020-04-03,59:35,Unnamed,Does that include the 11 million people who are in this country illegally? Are they going to be covered as well?
2020-04-03,59:41,Donald Trump,"We will be talking about that at a different time. Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-04-03,59:44,Unnamed,"Yes, Mr. President, will you authorize the release of the underlying data for the conclusion of the 100,000 to 240,000 people succumbing? Perhaps Dr. Birx can talk-"
2020-04-03,59:57,Donald Trump,That’s up to Dr. Birx. You will decide.
2020-04-03,59:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,We can release all of the-
2020-04-03,01:00:03,Unnamed,There’s some-
2020-04-03,01:00:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,We can release all of the …
2020-04-03,01:00:03,Unnamed,Disease experts have expressed concern that they haven’t seen the underlying data. They’re not quite sure …
2020-04-03,01:00:08,Donald Trump,"I’m sure they’ll talk to you about that, and Dr. Fauci, too. Please. Go ahead."
2020-04-03,01:00:12,Unnamed,"Thank you. Mr. President. This is for UN Secretary Azar. 10 million people say they’ve lost their jobs in the past two weeks, so how has the stimulus money for free treatment going to absorb the new numbers of uninsured and would it not be easier to reopen the Obamacare markets or expand Medicaid?"
2020-04-03,01:00:28,Alex Azar,"So for an individual who had employer insurance, that’s what I mentioned in my remarks, if you were employed and had insurance through your employer and you’ve now lost your job and lost that insurance, you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchanges of the Affordable Care Act, So that’s existing law. Then what we’re doing is taking from that hundred billion dollars to providers, taking money and saying, if you’re a provider and you care for anybody who is uninsured, we’re going to compensate you for doing that."
2020-04-03,01:00:59,Alex Azar,"And we’re going to compensate you at the Medicare reimbursement rates and you are not allowed to bill that uninsured individual anything. So in many respects it’s better for those uninsured individuals. They’re going to get first dollar coverage, they’re going to get care in the United States and the provider is going to be made whole from this program. So it’s really an unprecedented … What President Trump is doing here with this money is an unprecedented disease-specific support of care for individuals to make sure that people get treatment."
2020-04-03,01:01:30,Unnamed,Still be that if you test negative or what about non COVID conditions?
2020-04-03,01:01:34,Unnamed,"A couple of questions about supplies, one specifically on New York and the question of ventilators. Governor Cuomo was saying that New York may be days away from running out of ventilators. Can you assure New York that going into next week that they’re going to have the ventilators that they’re going to need?"
2020-04-03,01:01:50,Donald Trump,"No, they should’ve had more ventilators at the time. They should have had more ventilators. They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do, we’re doing our best for New York. We have states. We have a lot of states. We have territory’s too, but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of, some much more so than others. We’ve worked very well with the governor. We happen to think that he’s well-served with ventilators. We’re going to find out, but we have other states to take care of. We have a big problem in Louisiana. We have a big problem in Michigan."
2020-04-03,01:02:24,Donald Trump,"We have a big problem and seven other really strong hotspots, but we’re doing the best we can. I wish they did the original orders three years ago. They would’ve had all the ventilators they needed, although even then they wouldn’t. Because if you look at what the original request was from New York, it was far greater than anybody ever heard and we’ve supplied a lot. I told you we supplied some just today to New York and we supplied some yesterday to New York City. Did you have one in the back? Yeah, please."
2020-04-03,01:02:56,John (Reporter),This is why the question of the stockpile that was asked earlier is so important.
2020-04-03,01:02:59,Donald Trump,I don’t think that was the question.
2020-04-03,01:03:01,John (Reporter),"It was a very important question because what Jared Kushner said yesterday is that the federal stockpile is for use by the federal government, not for the states to have access to. So you seem to be saying different, so did Jared Kushner misspeak yesterday?"
2020-04-03,01:03:13,Donald Trump,"No, he didn’t misspeak."
2020-04-03,01:03:13,John (Reporter),Is that federal stockpile available to the states?
2020-04-03,01:03:15,Donald Trump,"He used the word, our. Okay. Our. Our is referring to our country …"
2020-04-03,01:03:20,John (Reporter),Not for the states to use?
2020-04-03,01:03:20,Donald Trump,"The states, to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge, are a part of our country. We are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping states all over the country, but we also want to keep some because when that surge comes, when you hit those peaks, we’re going to need, we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to Louisiana, New York, Detroit, different places. That’s all."
2020-04-03,01:03:44,John (Reporter),So you will be using them for the states?
2020-04-03,01:03:46,Donald Trump,"Of course, we’re not using them anywhere else. We’re not going to be using them, John, anywhere else. But we want the flexibility because we don’t even know when the surge is coming but it’s coming soon and it’s going to be big and some areas won’t have it. Some areas will be pleasantly surprised just like we’ve been, you look at the chart. States that I thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be really, they’d done a great job. Some states are really trouble, but you don’t know. You don’t know. We have great flexibility."
2020-04-03,01:04:14,Donald Trump,"I would have preferred giving them all out. We’d have nothing and now when we have a surge we can’t get them back from where we gave them because it’s very tough to take it back. So we have tremendous flexibility and it could be New York, it could be Louisiana. Those are two that are really rough. New Jersey is very rough and they’ve done a very good job in New Jersey. But New Jersey is very rough. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-03,01:04:34,Unnamed,Yes. The question or the question is about the CDC guidelines. I know that they changed over time from February and …
2020-04-03,01:04:40,Donald Trump,The guidelines relative to which? The masks?
2020-04-03,01:04:42,Unnamed,"Social distancing and the number of peoples who can gather in a group and so on. And now we have this measure about wearing masks and I know you told Steve about why you don’t want to wear a mask, but I’m just wondering if you can tell us more about why because it would set …"
2020-04-03,01:04:56,Donald Trump,I just don’t use them.
2020-04-03,01:04:57,Unnamed,An example.
2020-04-03,01:04:58,Donald Trump,"They’re not mandatory guidelines. They’re guidelines. They suggest you could wear them, don’t have to wear them. In fact, the director is here. If you want to say a couple of words about it, you can if you want. You don’t have to. But basically it’s a voluntary thing. Say it directly. Doing a good job."
2020-04-03,01:05:16,Unnamed,"Thank you very much. I think I just want to reemphasize, I’ve said this before, that we’re not defenseless against this virus. We have a powerful tool, a powerful weapon that is social distancing and we’ve continued to embrace that with the president’s initiatives to slow the spread of coronavirus. We’re constantly looking at new data. And as the surgeon general said, one of the new information that became more clear to all of us is there’s a greater number of people that are asymptomatically infected than we previously thought."
2020-04-03,01:05:46,Unnamed,"And as Ambassador Birx said, that may be inversely related to age. And so really the purpose here is first and foremost to embrace the social distancing. That’s the number one thing. That’s the powerful weapon. And this virus has a great weakness. It can’t jump from one person to another if it’s got to swim more than six feet. And this is why we really want that. That said, we now know that there may be individuals in areas of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infected. And we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particles that can go for one person to the other."
2020-04-03,01:06:24,Unnamed,"So as was said by the vice president and the president, the purpose of this face covering is to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spreading the virus from themself to someone else."
2020-04-03,01:06:41,Donald Trump,"And I was just tested also, so I assume I don’t have the virus so I don’t have to worry about spreading it. Okay. Please go ahead."
2020-04-03,01:06:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I want to make sure we’re clear. When you mentioned tariffs earlier, if it came up in a meeting, are you considering terrorists on Saudi Arabian oil? Also …."
2020-04-03,01:06:58,Donald Trump,"I’m always considering. Look, tariffs have made a tremendous amount of money for our country. I put them on China, I put them on other places and other countries tariff us and they take advantage of us or they have for many years. Look, countries have taken advantage of the United States for years. They’ve ripped us off like nobody can even believe, whether it be on manufacturing, whether it be on exporting, whether it be on almost anything, including military where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that frankly take advantage of us. Don’t even like us."
2020-04-03,01:07:33,Donald Trump,"Okay. So this has been going on for years. They terrify us, they create artificial, you could say nonfinancial barriers, which are worse than financial barriers. You can’t sell your product. You can’t take care of our farmers. They won’t take our and yet they’ll take us and sell into us and we won’t charge them anything for doing it. Look, they’ve taken advantage of us for years. Tariffs are a way of evening the score. Tariffs are a way of just neutralizing. They have tariffs on us and we now can put tariffs on them. Am I using it for oil? It’s something we can. No."
2020-04-03,01:08:10,Donald Trump,"Am I doing it now? No. Am I thinking about imposing it as of this moment? No. But if we’re not treated fairly, it’s certainly a tool in the toolbox."
2020-04-03,01:08:21,Unnamed,And what about with Russia? Are you what you consider maybe lifting sanctions or giving some sanctions relief?
2020-04-03,01:08:24,Donald Trump,"It would be the same thing. No. It would be the same thing. They are having a dispute, the two countries, and it’s hurting the rest of the world because it’s really hurting the energy industry. Russia’s being hurt unbelievably badly and Saudi Arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly because oil and gas is a primary, that’s where they get most of their income. And this is a price like from the 1950s. Right? It’s a price from the 1950s. They are being hurt very badly. I think they’re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-03,01:09:04,Unnamed,"On the oil, why do you raise the price? Why do you think you haven’t been more accessible in getting them to increase production in Russia and Saudi Arabia?"
2020-04-03,01:09:11,Donald Trump,"Well, they haven’t production. That’s what they’ve done. They’ve increased it so much that they’re, so you meant the opposite."
2020-04-03,01:09:17,Unnamed,Why haven’t you been successful?
2020-04-03,01:09:18,Donald Trump,"Look, well, they’re going to stop because the market. Ultimately, the market is going to get them to stop, but they both did the opposite. They increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil. Who would have ever thought? You go to some of these kingdoms, water is far more valuable than oil. There’s so much oil. It’s a tribute in a way. But what happened is there was a lot to start off with and then you had the virus and it knocked the hell out of the market in terms of demand. So there is no demand and this tremendous supply."
2020-04-03,01:09:56,Donald Trump,"So, I mean you saw our numbers where it was down to 20 and down frankly below 20. It was even below 20. It’s an incredible thing, the market, but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it. But I think they’re going to work out their problem fairly quickly. Okay. Go ahead."
2020-04-03,01:10:12,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. We’re already talking about phase four of a stimulus, but you and Pelosi and McConnell are already talking about different things that should be in it. Now, last time, people were telling me that the fact that you wouldn’t talk to Pelosi was an impediment and it really slowed things down. Are you …"
2020-04-03,01:10:29,Donald Trump,"I’d talk. If it were important to talk to her, I’d talk to her. If it were important for the American people, I’d talk to her. But other than that, I can have other people talking to her. Look, you ready? Infrastructure is a great thing for me. I think infrastructure for this country, we have an old broken infrastructure. 50 years ago, we were the envy of the world and then we spent all this money so stupidly in the Middle East. We spent, it’s going to be very close to $8 trillion in the Middle East. How stupid was that decision? But they spent it on that and other things."
2020-04-03,01:11:03,Donald Trump,"We’ve got to fix our infrastructure. That means roads, highways, tunnels, airports, everything. We got to fix our infrastructure. And the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong as a country, we’re borrowing at zero. We never had a chance to borrow at zero. Even this country, we never had a chance to borrow at zero. We’re going to borrow. This is a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we’ll have almost no interest because this is the time to do it. Steve, one more question."
2020-04-03,01:11:31,Steve (Reporter),"The death total projections that you shared with us earlier this week, are we still on the current trajectory for that or have …"
2020-04-03,01:11:38,Donald Trump,Which one? I have many trajectories for many things.
2020-04-03,01:11:40,Steve (Reporter),"100 to 40,000. Are we still on that trajectory or have we made any improvements or maybe not enough time has passed?"
2020-04-03,01:11:47,Donald Trump,"Say it, Steve. What?"
2020-04-03,01:11:49,Steve (Reporter),Have we made enough improvement?
2020-04-03,01:11:50,Donald Trump,On what?
2020-04-03,01:11:51,Steve (Reporter),On social models?
2020-04-03,01:11:54,Donald Trump,"I’d have to ask Dr. Fauci, and I’d have to ask Deborah. Have the models changed?"
2020-04-03,01:12:02,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So a lot of the projections you can see are based on, there’s many different ways to look at this. And as we discussed on Sunday, some of it is based on the current global experience. We are about, I think, 6.5 or 5.5 times the size of Italy, a different factor in Spain. And we look at all of those, what their projections are, where they are currently and where that is going, and so a lot of the work is based on how this virus has moved through other populations. That’s a very direct way to see how the virus is impacting of populations."
2020-04-03,01:12:41,Dr. Deborah Birx,"There’s also terrific models and so every day and every night, one of the models that actually looks at the model related to mortality is the healthdata.org data and they update it every night. And you can see where we are in that projection. I think in the last run of that model, they were at 93,000 or something in the model. Now all of that can be changed by our behaviors and all of it can be changed in a different way if we don’t follow those behaviors. If another major metropolitan area ends up having an epidemic like the New York Metro Area, that could dramatically change, not the model, but the reality of the impact of this virus on Americans."
2020-04-03,01:13:34,Donald Trump,"The models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come away under the models. If professionals did the models, I was never involved in a model, but…at least this is kind of a model…but you know what, hundreds of thousands of people they say are going to die, I want much less than that. I want none. But it’s too late for that, but I want very few people relative to what the models are saying. Those are projections. I hope they’re wrong. I hope we’re going to be under those projections."
2020-04-03,01:14:07,Unnamed,"Mr. President, two questions on continuity of government."
2020-04-03,01:14:10,Donald Trump,How come you always have two? Why can’t you have one?
2020-04-03,01:14:12,Unnamed,"Well, they relay."
2020-04-03,01:14:13,Donald Trump,"Every time, I have three questions. I have two questions. Can you give me one instead because there are a couple of other people? Go ahead."
2020-04-03,01:14:18,Unnamed,"Okay. I’ll go with my second one. Governor of Wisconsin is not talking about delaying the primary, at least not having to in-person voting. So my question is, and I asked this a couple of weeks ago, I want to see if you’ve made any progress on this. Looking ahead to the fall, are you taking steps to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic has re-emerged or hasn’t gone away?"
2020-04-03,01:14:38,Donald Trump,"The general election will happen on November 3rd. In Wisconsin, what happened is I, through social media, put out a very strong endorsement of a Republican conservative judge who’s an excellent, brilliant judge. He’s a justice. And I hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof and because of that, I think they delayed the election."
2020-04-03,01:15:02,Unnamed,Aren’t you concerned about people going to in-person voting?
2020-04-03,01:15:04,Donald Trump,I don’t know. Why didn’t he do it before? He’s doing the right before the election.
2020-04-03,01:15:07,Unnamed,"But, do you think every …"
2020-04-03,01:15:08,Donald Trump,"Excuse me. Why didn’t he do this two weeks ago? All of a sudden, excuse me. All of a sudden, an election which is taking place very soon, gets delayed now. I just endorsed him today and it was a very strong endorsement. His polls, he’s gone very high up and all of a sudden the governor comes out, the Democrat governor, by the way, comes out and says, oh, we’re going to move this election. So I don’t know. I hope you’re right. I hope you’re right."
2020-04-03,01:15:34,Unnamed,Do you think every state in this country should be prepared for mail in voting in case we’re in a situation?
2020-04-03,01:15:39,Donald Trump,"No. I think a lot of people cheat with mail in voting. I think people should vote with ID, voter ID. I think voter ID is very important and the reason they don’t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat. When you get something, when you buy something, you look at your cards and credit cards and different cards. You have your picture and many of them, not all of them, but on many of them, you should have a picture on your for voting. It should be called voter ID. They should have that and it shouldn’t be mail in, excuse me. It shouldn’t be mail in voting."
2020-04-03,01:16:11,Donald Trump,"It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don’t send it in the mail where people pick up. All sorts of bad things can happen by the time they sign that, if they sign that, if they sign that, by the time it gets in and it’s tabulated. No, it shouldn’t be mailed in. You should vote at the booth and you should have voter ID. Because when you have voter ID, that’s the real deal. Thank you very much. We’ll see you tomorrow."
2020-04-03,01:16:39,Unnamed,Do you have an update on the domestic travel restrictions?
2020-04-03,01:16:48,Unnamed,Why did the website definition of a stockpile change? Why did the definition of a stockpile change this morning on your website?
2020-04-04,00:00,Unnamed,"Thank you, Doctor Fauci."
2020-04-04,01:08,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Busy time, very busy time. And let me begin by again expressing our support, solidarity, and love for the people of our great country. We’re fighting for you and we’re enduring all of this together and we will soon prevail together and they get a lot of progress. We appreciate all of the great assistance from the governors and people within the states, the relationships have been really very good. I spoke with Governor Cuomo, were working very hard to get additional things to New York as quickly as possible. We, as you know, we took care of the hospital including personnel, the 2,500 beds that we built just recently, a Javits including personnel, and we opened it up to COVID and it’s something that we also did in Louisiana and we’re doing it in Dallas. So we have a lot of, not only hospitals being built, but now we’re manning the hospitals because States are in many cases unable to get additional people to work, it’s just an incredible situation. There’s never been anything like this."
2020-04-04,02:32,Donald Trump,"One of the most important issues in battling this pandemic is coordinating the delivery of the crucial supplies throughout the nation based upon the most accurate information available and we’ve got the best healthcare and disaster experts anywhere in the world and everybody will tell you that and we’re dealing with big parts of the world on helping them also through this horrible situation where 151, still 151, nations are going through it. We’re working to ensure that the supplies are delivered where and when they’re needed. In some cases we’re telling governors, “We can’t go there because we don’t think you need it and we think someplace else needs it.” Then pretty much so far we’ve been right about that and we’ll continue to do it as it really gets, this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week and there’ll be a lot of death unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn’t done, but there will be death."
2020-04-04,03:35,Donald Trump,"We’re looking for an obvious focus and the hardest hit regions. Some of them are obvious and some aren’t so obvious. They spring up. They come and they hit you like you got hit by a club, an area that wasn’t at all bothered. You look at what’s going on in New Jersey. The governor’s doing an excellent job by the way, but how that sprang up. Every decision that we’re making is made to save lives. It’s really our sole consideration. We want to save lives. We want as few lives lost as possible. It’s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public. It’s just incredible. I could name them, but it’s the same ones always the same ones. I guess they’re looking for ratings, I don’t know what they’re looking for, so bad for our country and so bad that people understand it. You look at the levels and approval ratings are the lowest they’ve ever been for media. It’s so bad for our country, so bad for the world. You got to put it together for a little while, get this over with and then go back to your fakeness. During a national emergency it’s just essential that the federal decision makers cut through the fog of confusion in order to follow the facts and the science."
2020-04-04,04:58,Donald Trump,"Many hospital administrators that we’ve been in touch with, even in the really hot spots, you know what they are, are communicating directly with us that their level of supplies are meeting essential needs and at the current time they’re really thrilled to be where they are. Whenever local shortages are reported, we’re asking states to immediately meet the demand and we’re stockpiling large amounts in different areas, in different areas, and we’re going to be discussing that in a little while, but we want distributions to be made on a fair basis. We have to take care of a large country, not just certain areas of the country. But no matter where we’ve been there and we’ve been there very strong."
2020-04-04,05:46,Donald Trump,"I want to thank FEMA, I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers, I want to thank our military for what they’re doing. And we’re going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help supplement the states. Thousands of soldiers, thousands of medical workers, professionals, nurses, doctors, and it’ll be a large number, it’ll be, we’ll be telling them over the next very short period where they’re going. They’re going into war, they’re going into a battle that they’ve never really trained for. Nobody’s trained for this, nobody’s seen this, I would say since 1917 which was the greatest of them all. The greatest of this type of battle, probably the greatest of them all right? 1917. Up to a hundred million people were killed."
2020-04-04,06:39,Donald Trump,"In addition, we’re working directly with hospitals and existing suppliers and distributors to ensure that those with the greatest need are prioritized and that need changes. One day it’s one state or one locale, one city, and then all of a sudden they’re starting to do well. We had some very good reports coming out of the state of Washington, coming out of various parts of California, so areas that we were getting ready to really hit hard, we can now go to other areas. It looks like New York is going to be hit very hard and Louisiana is just amazing the way it just spread up and everyone’s doing a good job, but they’re going to be hit hard. Areas in the country that are not experiencing large scale infections are requesting supplies beyond what their present circumstances require and we talked to them or we tell them and we explain it and for the most part they’re good with it. We think we’re right."
2020-04-04,07:36,Donald Trump,"It’s very understandable that officials would seek to get the most they can get for their communities, but the fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests. We have some states and areas where they’re just asking for far more. Look, we had one state asking for 40,000 ventilators, 40,000 think of it. 40, 000. It’s not possible. They won’t need that many and now they’re admitting they don’t need that many, but we’re getting as many as we can to them."
2020-04-04,08:10,Donald Trump,"Again, nobody’s ever seen anything like this in terms of ventilators, in terms of protective equipment and uniforms and outfits, but it makes it more difficult for distributors to prioritize the real need and it could intentionally and everybody has proper intentions but they want to make sure they’re 100% and sometimes when they know they don’t need it, they want it anyway. It gives them that extra feeling of satisfaction, but we just can’t do that. It’s not even possible to think about it. And that’s why, and we’re backup. Remember we’re a backup. We’re the greatest backup that ever existed for the states, especially when we start getting into hospital building business and getting into the medical center building business. When you see we built many hospitals, numerous hospitals in some states and medical centers. That’s why my administration’s been requesting actual usage numbers directly from the States and hospitals to meet their needs because we want to be ready when the brunt of it comes, which is coming quickly, you see it, you see it as sure as you can see it, and when the brunt of it comes, we want to be ready to hit the area that needs it. We don’t want to have spent everything in one area and they don’t need it there to anywhere near the extent."
2020-04-04,09:31,Donald Trump,"So, let me be extremely clear about one point. We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens. We will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource, we’ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure, and to get this thing over with. We want to finish this war. We have to get back to work. We have to open our country again. We have to open our country again. We don’t want to be doing this for months and months and months. We’re going to open our country again. This country wasn’t meant for this fewer, fewer, but we have to open our country again."
2020-04-04,10:17,Donald Trump,"I just spoke with the commissioners, leaders of, I would say virtually all of the sports leagues. Rob Manfred, Commissioner of Baseball, Major League Baseball, Roger Goodell, Commissioner of the National Football League, Adam Silver, Commissioner of the National Basketball Association, Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the National Hockey League, Jay Monaghan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour, Cathy Engelbert, Commissioner of the Women’s National Basketball Association. Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Vince McMan, President of the WWE, Don Garber, Commissioner of Major League Soccer, Steve Phelps, President of NASCAR, Michael Wahn, Commissioner of the LPGA, Roger Penske, founder and Chairman Penske Corp and Drew Fleming, President of the Breeders’ Cup, and there were a couple of others on and these are all the great leaders of sport and they want to get back, they got to get back. They can’t do this. The sports weren’t designed for it. The whole concept of our nation wasn’t designed for, we’re going to have to get back. We want to get back soon. Very soon."
2020-04-04,11:36,Donald Trump,"For example, and I have to say we’re using the Defense Production Act very powerfully and sometimes directly, in many cases indirectly, just the threat of it’s usually enough, but FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million, think of that, 180 million who have a herd of 180,000,000 N95 masks? And we’re working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country and I think it’s going to be okay. We’re going to soon let you know, but we need the masks. We don’t want other people getting it. That’s why we’re instituting a lot of Defense Production Act … You could call it retaliations because that’s what it is. It’s a retaliation. If people don’t, if people don’t give us what we need for our people, we’re going to be very tough and we’ve been very tough. Usually we don’t have to use it, but we’ve used it plenty. It’s turning out more and more unfortunately, and it works very well."
2020-04-04,12:48,Donald Trump,"Our supply chain logistics task force led by Admiral John Polowczyk is doing a fantastic job, will ensure they are distributed through the healthcare and critical infrastructure workers in the areas with the most pressing requirements. That’s the 60 million masks that we’re talking about and the 180,000,000 N95 mass, 180 million, whoever heard of 180 million masks? And this is a incredible thing. A lot of times that we have to stop playing this game, if a governor wants 200 ventilators and I say “No, we’re going to send you a thousand, we think you need more than 200,” and then the media meets with the governor and they say, “Oh you got more, well, it’s not enough. The president should have sent more.” So he’s asking for 200 we give him thousand, they say, “How’s the president doing? He should have given more,” because that’s politics. That’s politics. And that’s unfortunate because we can’t play that game. And you know that’s one party doing it and the other party’s happy, but they’re all really happy because they should have been doing this work themselves for a long period of time."
2020-04-04,14:05,Donald Trump,"Many of their cupboards were bare with respect to the ventilators. FEMA and HHS continued to monitor the data on an hourly basis where provided by the States in order to most effectively target the distribution of supplies. We’ve been asking States to provide us with daily updates on the number of ventilators and their utilization rates because some states have more ventilators than they need. They don’t even like to admit it. They’ll admit it when everything’s over, but that’s doesn’t help us very much. This data is vitally necessary so that we can ensure ventilators are getting to the right place at the right time. FEMA, HHS, DOD are developing resources within the next 24 hours. They will have a whole different set of criteria every day. It’s different criteria every day. This horrible invisible enemy changes. Of course, it changes course."
2020-04-04,15:05,Donald Trump,"If you were fighting the normal fight, you know what’s happening. Here’s, they hit one, they hit another. They had another state. They hit areas that you didn’t expect, but we’re watching it and we’re capturing it. Our goal is to stay several days ahead of the needs in each state, but we can only do that if the cities and states utilize real time, local knowledge to provide timely and precise data about actual usage. So, we have to be able to do that."
2020-04-04,15:37,Donald Trump,"And if a state has ventilators, as an example, that they know they’re not going to need, they should give them over and we should move them with the other ones. We have now 10,000 in our pipeline and stockpiled 10,000 close and we’re moving some into New York because we’re going to need some additional, we’re moving some into New York City and State separately and we’re bringing them to the point where they’ll need them."
2020-04-04,16:05,Donald Trump,"I can also report that at my direction, 1000 military personnel are deploying to New York City to assist where they’re needed the most. That’s the hottest of all the hotspots. New Jersey is right there. It’s right next to it and I don’t know if that’s overflow, but New Jersey’s, it’s a great state and it’s a very, it’s a crowded state also where you have people on top of people. It’s always tough, but we’re bringing some of the ventilators. We got some for New Jersey just yesterday and we’re going to bring them some more including doctors. We’re getting doctors, nurses, respiratory specialist, and other support workers. These are from the military. We’re taking people now out of our military. We’ve been doing it, but now we’re doing it on a larger basis and I want to thank Secretary of Defense Esper who will detail some of what we’re doing tomorrow and Monday."
2020-04-04,16:56,Donald Trump,"As the situation in Washington State continues to stabilize, we’re returning a 300 bed federal medical station to a different location, so where we need it and we appreciate that they won’t be needing it and we appreciate them letting us know we’re going to move it to a different location. It was already built."
2020-04-04,17:18,Donald Trump,"Many governors initially made large requests for federal support for their states in anticipation of a greater number of cases, but the residents of Washington State have done a really good job of following the federal distancing guidelines. They really have."
2020-04-04,17:35,Donald Trump,"I’m also pleased to report that Oregon will be spending and sending. They’re spending a lot of money because they really did stockpile well and they’re also sending 140 ventilators directly to New York, which we appreciate."
2020-04-04,17:50,Donald Trump,"And I want to thank the Vice President for the great work he’s doing every day dealing with our nation’s governors. Mike Pence has been working day and night on this and we want to get it over. He’s got to get a little more sleep than he’s getting. He hasn’t been getting very much, I will tell you that, and we’re all in this together. It’s a beautiful thing to see how people are joining forces to help one another. They really are."
2020-04-04,18:15,Donald Trump,"In addition to our courageous doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, I also want to thank the incredible food supply workers who are feeding our nation. I spoke just a little while ago to Senator Bozeman, you know Senator Bozeman, we all do, he’s a great Senator, he’s a great person. We spoke just this morning and we discussed how important it is to keep our farmers and ranchers, processors and distributors in our nation’s prayers and I want to thank the Senator for the incredible job he’s been doing. And a lot of the senators and congressmen and everyone. Everybody’s working very hard."
2020-04-04,18:56,Donald Trump,"My administration is working very aggressively to pioneer new medical countermeasures to treat and prevent infection working on a lot of things. We must utilize our nation’s scientific brilliance to vanquish the virus. We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can because we have a lot of things happening in this country and we have a great future, but we have to get back to work."
2020-04-04,19:29,Donald Trump,"This week the FDA established the Coronavirus treatment accelerator program, which is expediting the development of new antiviral and other therapies and they’re doing it on a very rapid basis and I think we’re having some very good results. We’ll tell you about that."
2020-04-04,19:49,Donald Trump,"HHS continues to speed the development of therapies derived from human blood that have the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness. And as you know, last Saturday the FDA also gave emergency authorization for hydroxy chloroquine and the hydroxy chloroquine is a, I hope it’s going to be a very important answer. We’re having some very good things happening with it and we’re going to be distributing it through the strategic national stockpile. It’s going into these strategic national stockpile to treat certain patients and we have millions and millions of doses of it, 29 million to be exact. In addition to that, we’re making it and we’re also getting it from various other locations and countries. In one case I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning, they make large amounts of hydroxy chloroquine very large amounts frankly."
2020-04-04,21:02,Donald Trump,"And I said, they had a hold because you know they have 1.5 billion people and they think a lot of it and I said I’d appreciate if they would release the amounts that we ordered and they are giving it serious consideration. But India makes a lot of it, but we have already 29 million, if you look it’s a big number, 29 million doses and we’ve got millions of doses that are being made here and many millions of doses that are made elsewhere that are being shipped here and it will be arriving. We’re just hearing really positive stories and we’re continuing to collect the data, but I’ll just speak for myself. It’s been out for a long time."
2020-04-04,21:53,Donald Trump,"It’s a malaria drug. It’s also a drug for lupus and there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus, they’re not affected so much by it. Now, maybe that’s correct. Maybe it’s false. You’re going to have to check it out, but there’s a lot of very positive things happening with that. That’s a game changer. If that’s the case, obviously we continue to work on the vaccines, but the vaccines have to be down the road by probably 14, 15, 16 months."
2020-04-04,22:25,Donald Trump,"We’re doing great on the vaccines. I think Johnson and Johnson is leading … Seems to be leading in terms of the studies, but we’ll see what happens. But I feel good about that. But that’s down the road. But a tremendous promise with what’s just been mentioned."
2020-04-04,22:43,Donald Trump,"In addition to that, Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase three that’s down the line, meaning clinical studies of the drug, remdesivir, now it’s approximately 1,000 patients, which is a pretty good study. Other drugs are also being studied in patients and this week Oracle, great company donated a new web portal. Larry Ellison, amazing guy and platform to the government to gather real time data on how patients are responding to the various new treatments and they have a very sophisticated site. We’ll be learning a lot from Oracle and thank you to them."
2020-04-04,23:26,Donald Trump,"We’re also spending economic dollars like you wouldn’t believe and speeding economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses. Yesterday the Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program to help employees keep paying their workers. In 24 hours, the Small Business Administration and over 1,200 lending partners processed over 28,000 loans. It’s so far ahead of schedule and billions and billions of dollars. It’s worked out incredibly well and I want to thank Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase and a lot of the big banks that have been involved and a lot of the community banks, community banks have really jumped on it and it’s a so far going way ahead of schedule. The SBA also clarified that faith-based organizations, including houses of worship, are eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program. That’s great. As well as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program that you’re familiar with on the same terms as every other applicant. If we run out of funding for the Employee Retention Program, I will immediately ask Congress for more money. This is money that’s really going directly to the people that need it, the small businesses that need it and the workers that need it."
2020-04-04,24:54,Donald Trump,"Finally, because when we open, we want to open strong with businesses that are going. Remember we had the greatest economy in the world and then one day we were told, “You got to shut it down. Stop it. Tell everyone to stay home because of this horrible virus.” And we did that and we did the right thing, but now we have to open. We have to open our country."
2020-04-04,25:18,Donald Trump,"Finally, I can report that as of today, the State Department has successfully coordinated the safe return of more than 40,000 Americans stuck abroad on over 400 flights from 75 countries. Many of those countries were terrific in helping us and I appreciate that very much. Some of them, I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know, and once I did, they snapped like you wouldn’t believe. They really helped us great, so I appreciate that. So we brought back 40,000 Americans who were literally stuck in some countries with no chance of getting out. We got them back. 400 flights, 75 countries. Think of that. And those countries in almost every instance had a big problem with a virus."
2020-04-04,26:02,Donald Trump,"I want to thank the American people, most of all for the selfless sacrifices that they’re making for our nation. I know it’s not pleasant. Although some people have said they’ve gotten to know their family better and they love their family more than ever, and that’s a beautiful thing. They’ve actually gotten to know them. They’re in the same house with their family for a long time. I guess it can also work the other way perhaps, but we don’t want to talk about that."
2020-04-04,26:29,Donald Trump,"And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on slowing the spread. Sustaining this war effort is, and that’s what it is, it’s a war effort, is the patriotic duty of every citizen. While we may be more physically distant for a time, we’re closer together in the heart and in the spirit and through this great national unity is happening, we’re having a great unity developing that a lot of people didn’t think it would be possible to develop like this and we will conquer the disease and restore our nation to its full and"
2020-04-04,27:03,Donald Trump,"… the disease and restore our nation to its full and glorious might. We’re doing really well and I’m very proud of everybody out there. We’re very proud of you. It’s something that nobody could have ever projected. It’s been over a hundred years that a thing like this has happened. And the problem with this one is the contagion. It’s so contagious. Nobody’s ever seen anything like that where it’s so contagious. You can be feet away and just talking to somebody and catch it. You can catch it … you know how long it can live on surfaces. So things that nobody even thought of, the level of contagion."
2020-04-04,27:40,Donald Trump,"So we’re getting there. We’re going to make sure that it’s over soon and just keep going. It’s not going to be long and thank you very much. And with that, I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn to speak and he’s been doing yeoman’s work at the FDA. Thank you very much, doctor. Thank you."
2020-04-04,28:04,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Thank you, Mr. President. I’m going to speak about hydroxychloroquine and the efforts around that. Just a preface, I’d like to echo what the president said about the American people, and the resiliency, and the just terrific work. Mitigation is such an important part of our fight against the COVID-19 virus. Last week as the president said, we issued an emergency use authorization to allow the donated hydroxychloroquine to come into the country and enter the general circulation. We are prioritizing this drug to come in for clinical trials, also to general use for physicians because, as you know, physicians, based upon their interaction with the patients, their assessment of the risks and benefits, can write a prescription for hydroxychloroquine if they think it’s appropriate for that patient. Being a physician, we do this all the time, and that assessment needs to be done between a patient and a doctor. And then the third portion is we wanted to make sure that these drugs were in the supply chain so that people who have them or need them for the other indications, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, had them available. So that was the purpose of the emergency use authorization."
2020-04-04,29:15,Dr. Steven Hahn,"One other thing I’d like to mention is that we, on Friday, stood up a formal convalescent plasma program. We have a great deal of enthusiasm for that. There are some reports that this is of benefit to patients in other countries who have had the COVID-19 virus. And what this means is taking plasma from patients who’ve had the virus and who have recovered, and transferring the immunity, the immunoglobulins if you will, the immunity from that person to someone who’s sick. And we’re, hopefully, expanding that across the country. The Red Cross is involved in that program and I think it shows a great promise. It needs to be studied like other things, but just like I said before, it provides hope. We don’t want to provide false hope, but definitely hope. Thank you."
2020-04-04,29:59,Donald Trump,"Tony, please."
2020-04-04,30:02,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. I’d like to just take a couple of moments to talk a little bit about the public health aspects and how it relates to what the president just said about the need for us to begin to at least think about returning to some degree of normality. And that has to do with what’s going to be happening as we end this week and we go into next week."
2020-04-04,30:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You will be seeing, and we should not be surprised because the kinetics of how this virus works, is that we’re going to be seeing that they’re going to be deaths that are going to continue to go up. But as I mentioned to this group and to the general public multiple times, there really is a cascading of events where you have new cases, hospitalizations, intensive care, and deaths. So at the same time that we may be seeing an increase in deaths, we want to focus on … The effect of mitigation is really the number of new cases, and that’s what we’re going to be thinking about and looking about. So we’re going to pay close attention to that. And hopefully the kinds of mitigations that we’re talking about are going to have the impact to allow us to begin to think about maybe changing a bit."
2020-04-04,31:08,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So the question arises is is the mitigation working? So let’s look historically and then just look at the reality of it. Clearly in the countries, China included, that have implemented very strict kinds of programs of mitigation, clearly it works. In our own country, we’ve seen indication of that in Washington. Remember Washington state was the first to get hit, but they put in a really good program of mitigation. And if you look at the charts that Dr. Birx showed the other day, they’re still down there doing well."
2020-04-04,31:42,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And the reason is, again, what I’ve said before, but I think it’s worth reiterating, that we have two opposing forces here. The virus, which wants to do what the virus wants to do, viruses transmit from people to people. When people are separated from each other, virus does not transmit. It doesn’t go anywhere. And that’s the reason why something as simple as the physical separation … Because if you look at the vice president’s chart that he shows all the time here from this podium, every aspect of that ending the COVID outbreak in 30 days has, some aspect of it, a physical separation. Whether that’s avoiding crowds, whether that’s staying six feet away from people, whether that’s doing teleworking, all of it does that. That’s our most important tool. We’ll be talking about vaccines and drugs and things like that that will mitigate later, but this is what we really have to do. And I want to actually just plead, as I do multiple times from here, to the American public. As sobering and as difficult as this is, what we are doing is making a difference. So we really need to continue to do that."
2020-04-04,32:53,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I must tell you, I was just mentioning to the vice president as we came in, last night when I wasn’t here … I went out with my wife and actually did a little power walking down Massachusetts Avenue. Those who live in Washington know what I’m talking about. And we passed a couple of restaurants where people were getting takeout food. The restaurants were closed to people going in, but they were open to takeout. And I saw something that absolutely made me feel really, really good. They were separating themselves by at least six feet. In fact, some of the restaurants had little things on the floor that said, “Stand here and then stand there.” And I think if we as a nation pulled together to do that, hopefully when we keep coming back here at these press conferences, we’ll be able to show you that that curve that we keep talking about is going in the right direction. And I’d be happy to answer questions later. Thank you."
2020-04-04,33:47,Donald Trump,"Thank you. Okay, please."
2020-04-04,33:51,Unnamed,"You said earlier that the virus is springing up in areas you did not expect. Yesterday, you said some States in the country are not in jeopardy. The fact that this is unpredictable, isn’t that an argument for every state to have one of these [crosstalk 00:34:04]?"
2020-04-04,34:04,Donald Trump,"I don’t think so. There are some States that you have great distance, natural distance, big land, few people, and they’re in very good shape. And if there is a case, they can quarantine that person or that person will be separated, will be brought to a hospital, a secure area. So you do have different cases as opposed to a New York or Los Angeles. Los Angeles is doing incredibly well by the way. But areas where you have lots of people tight together is a big difference. So no, there are many different cases. Please?"
2020-04-04,34:36,Unnamed,"You mentioned the military off the top. So a thousand troops go into New York, and then are we expecting other mass deployments around the country? And then is it just army? Is it-"
2020-04-04,34:45,Donald Trump,"Many of the places are really in great shape, they really have done a fantastic job, and we may add to the thousand. But New York will be getting about a thousand military people, nurses, doctors, lots of other people because that’s what they need. [crosstalk 00:35:01] Medical, no, no, medical military. Please?"
2020-04-04,35:05,Unnamed,"Sir, you tweeted earlier today that you liked the idea of a second coronavirus task force that was focused on reopening the economy. I was wondering if you were planning to go forward with that?"
2020-04-04,35:15,Donald Trump,"Thinking about it, getting a group of people. We have to open our country. I had an expression: The cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. I started by saying that and I continue to say it. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. We’ve got to get our country open."
2020-04-04,35:38,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:35:38] reopening. Can you talk about your call with the sports commissioners? Did you say you’d like to see people back, fans back in arenas?"
2020-04-04,35:44,Donald Trump,"Absolutely, I want fans back in the arenas. I think it’s [crosstalk 00:35:48] … No, whenever we’re ready. As soon as we can, obviously. And the fans want to be back too. They want to see basketball, and baseball, and football, and hockey. They want to see their sports, they want to go out onto the golf courses and breathe nice, clean, beautiful, fresh air."
2020-04-04,36:05,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:09:07].
2020-04-04,36:08,Donald Trump,"I can’t tell you a date, but I think it’s going to be sooner rather than later. We’re not going to have to have separation for the rest of our times on the planet. We need it for this period of time, but eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats in arenas next to each other like we have for all of my life and all of your life. They want to sit next to each other at restaurants. They don’t want to be six feet away."
2020-04-04,36:37,Donald Trump,"Some restaurant man called up. He said, “I’m worried because I have a small restaurant with not too many seats.” I think he said 120. And he said, “If I practice what this is, I’m down to 30 seats. I can’t make it.” I said, “Don’t worry about it. That’s for a short period of time. You’ll be back to your number of seats.” We can’t do that. Otherwise you’re making everything. That means your stadium is half the size of what it was a month ago. No, no, they’re going to be close together, but they’re going to be breathing air that’s not infected, that’s not going to kill people. Please?"
2020-04-04,37:09,Unnamed,"Since you’re not getting ready to pack the stadiums by August, what are your-"
2020-04-04,37:13,Donald Trump,"I’m not committing to it. We’re going to see where we are. That’d be great if we could. But we’re going to be back to good health soon, in my opinion. We’re making a lot of progress. And we’re making progress because, as Tony told a story about the restaurant and about how they were separated sort of automatically, people are doing that. They’re staying in their homes, they don’t want to go out, they’re doing what they know is the right thing to do. It’s not very complicated. In many ways, it’s a very beautiful thing to see. Yeah?"
2020-04-04,37:45,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:37:45] contingency plans for the Republican National Convention?
2020-04-04,37:48,Donald Trump,"We have no contingency plan. We’re having the convention at the end of August and we think by the end of August we’ll be in good shape. We have no contingency. It’s going to be in North Carolina, as you know, in Charlotte, and I think we’re going to have a great convention. I notice … I think we had an opponent, but I almost didn’t know who it was. He got .00001% of the vote, but I heard he dropped out three or four weeks ago. I’m not sure, maybe you could tell me. That’s the kind of opponent I had, and hopefully we have another one just like that in Joe."
2020-04-04,38:24,Unnamed,"Mr. President, this weekend, lawmakers are working on the next round of relief packages. What was not in the stimulus package that you signed last week that you would like to see in phase four?"
2020-04-04,38:32,Donald Trump,"Well, I think we’re going to need more money for the small businesses. It’s been working out so well, it’s been so efficient. The banks have been doing an incredible job. I think we’re going to need more money there. I think, we’ll see. But based on the first couple of days, it’s been incredible. I think that restaurants and entertainment, that would be sports leagues, all forms of entertainment, go back to the original where they get tax deductibility for what they’re doing, and for people who come in and buy tickets or go out for meals. And corporations can then send people into these restaurants who are going to have a hard time otherwise opening in my opinion. And that could be the same for the sports leagues."
2020-04-04,39:13,Donald Trump,"So we want to see, for entertainment and for restaurants, deductibility, so that corporations can take a deduction. They’ll send their executives, they’ll send people there, and they get a deduction. That is something that will really bring life back to the restaurants, I think. Make them hotter than before. They used to have it, and when they ended it, it was really never the same. It was never the same. Yeah, please?"
2020-04-04,39:36,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you just said that you want to see us few lives lost as possible in this pandemic. But there are still eight governors, all Republicans, who have refused to issue these statewide stay at home orders. Your own experts, including Dr. Fauci, have said stay at home orders are the most effective way to stop the spread of this virus. So why not do everything possible [crosstalk 00:39:57] right now to do that?"
2020-04-04,40:00,Donald Trump,"We have a thing called the constitution, which I cherish, number one. Number two, those governors, I know every one of them, they’re doing a great job. They’re being very, very successful in what they’re doing. And as you know, I want the governors to be running things. Now in some cases, we’ll supersede, but in this case it’s not [crosstalk 00:40:20]. It depends on the individual state that you’re talking about. But they’re doing very well, and they’re doing a magnificent job in running their states."
2020-04-04,40:28,Unnamed,"South Carolina has 1700 cases right now of coronavirus. Utah has 1,255. Are these not States that you think should have the stay at home order?"
2020-04-04,40:36,Donald Trump,"No, I think they’re doing a great job. That’s a very small number relative to population."
2020-04-04,40:40,Unnamed,It’s larger than some states that do have stay at home orders.
2020-04-04,40:43,Donald Trump,"It’s up to them. If I saw something wrong, if I saw a massive breakout, of which that’s not, I would come down very hard."
2020-04-04,40:51,Unnamed,Isn’t the key to this pandemic getting ahead of those numbers though?
2020-04-04,40:54,Donald Trump,"No, not in that case, but in the case … I know the states you’re talking about. By the way, I think you’re up to 92% of the country is covered. And from a constitutional standpoint, they made the difference, they called the shots. Yes, Jeff, go ahead?"
2020-04-04,41:08,Unnamed,"Mr. President, just a question about messaging. You and the others here are saying people need to continue following the mitigation efforts, but they’re also saying again, the cure must not be worse than the problem. Which is it?"
2020-04-04,41:21,Donald Trump,"I’m just saying we have to get this country open, Jeff. It has to get open. This country was not designed to be closed. So we have the greatest we’ve ever had and then we’re paying people to stay home? Well, think of it. We’re paying people not to go to work. How about that? How does that play? And they want to go to work, by the way. They don’t want money. This country is great. But we’re paying people, we have to get back to work. That’s what I’m saying. Go ahead, please?"
2020-04-04,41:50,Unnamed,"Mr. President, this is off topic. It’s about the announcement from last night. It’s a yes or no question, not that we expect the answer to be yes or no. But wasn’t Michael Atkinson doing the job of the inspector general of the intelligence community, the job he was supposed to do, when he simply took the whistleblower complaint to Congress, what hadn’t been taken previously? Wasn’t he doing the job that he was supposed to do, that American taxpayers were paying him to do? And why did you decide to terminate him?"
2020-04-04,42:19,Donald Trump,"I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible. He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report … it was fake, it was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress with an emergency. Not a big Trump fan, that I can tell you. Instead of saying, and we offered this to him, “No, no, we will tape the conversation” … we’re fortunate we had that transcript. If we didn’t have a transcript, with the kind of a deception and dishonesty that were practiced by the Democrats, I might not be standing here right now. Fortunately, we had a transcript. And it was a perfect transcript because even the Lieutenant Colonel admitted it was correct."
2020-04-04,43:07,Donald Trump,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute. You asked that question. So he took this whistleblower and I keep saying, where’s the whistleblower, and why was the whistleblower allowed to do this? Why was he allowed to be, you call it, fraudulent or incorrect transcript. So we offered this IG … I don’t know him, I don’t think I ever met him, he never even came in to see me. How can you do that without seeing the person? He never came into see me, never requested to see me. He took this terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report, and he brought it to Congress. We offered to have him see my exact conversation. It was all about the conversation, by the way. That was the whole thing. It was about the conversation. And then after he saw it, he must have said, “Wow,” because, as I’ve said it many times, and it drives you people crazy, it was a perfect conversation."
2020-04-04,43:58,Donald Trump,"So instead of going and saying, ” Gee, this is a terrible thing he said about the president’s conversation,” well it was a fraud. I didn’t say that. And by the way, you have the whistle blower. Where’s the informer? And here’s another question. Remember before I gave the transcript, in other words, before I revealed the real conversation, where’s the second whistleblower? Remember the second whistle … wait, wait, wait, wait. There was going to be a second whistleblower. But after I gave the conversation, he just went away. He miraculously went away. Where’s the informer? Because there was going to be this informer … Maybe Schiff was the informant. You ever think of that? He’s a corrupt guy, he’s a corrupt politician."
2020-04-04,44:41,Donald Trump,"So listen, I say this. Where’s the informer? Remember, the informer was coming forward. Because, see, I did one that surprised everybody. This gentleman right here said, “Boy, that was a shocker.” I revealed the conversation. I got approval from Ukraine, because I didn’t want to do it without their approval. And they said, “Absolutely, you did nothing wrong.” By the way, president of Ukraine, Foreign Minister said, “He did nothing wrong.” And over that, with 196 to nothing vote by the Republicans, not one dissenting Republican vote, dishonest Democrats impeached a president of the United States. That man is a disgrace to IGs. All right, let’s go, next. Please? [crosstalk 00:45:24] He was a total disgrace."
2020-04-04,45:26,Unnamed,Did you run by your decision to dismiss the inspector general by a Senator?
2020-04-04,45:32,Donald Trump,"We’ll get off this because people want to talk about what we’re talking about. But let me just tell you something. That’s my decision. I have the absolute right. Even the fake news last night said, “He has the absolute right to do it.” But ask him, “Why didn’t you go and see the actual conversation?” There was no rush. He said, “Oh, we have to rush it.” He even said it was politically biased. He actually said. The report could have been, you know who the whistle blower is, and so do you, and so does everybody in this room, and so do I. Everybody knows, but they give this whistleblower status that he doesn’t deserve. He’s a fake whistleblower. And frankly, somebody ought to sue his ass off. All right, that’s enough of the whistleblower. Go ahead, please?"
2020-04-04,46:14,Unnamed,The governor of New York today said that he is still desperate for ventilators and that he has accepted a thousand of them from the Chinese government. Are you concerned-?
2020-04-04,46:22,Donald Trump,"What he didn’t say is … okay, let me tell you what he didn’t say. Two very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators. Two very good friends of mine, they brought them. If you’d like their name, I’ll give you their name. [crosstalk 00:46:40] No, but the governor didn’t mention that it came through the Chinese, the country of China, but they were given by two friends of mine. But he didn’t tell you that."
2020-04-04,46:50,Donald Trump,"Now the governor also … you’ll see when you read the letter. The governor also asked for 40,000, he wanted 40,000 ventilators. Now the governor, as you know, had a chance to get 16,000 a few years ago. He decided not to get that. The state of New York has asked for help. I’ve given him four hospitals, four medical centers, then I gave him an additional hospital, then I gave a military people to operate the hospital. They were not supposed to be COVID hospitals. Interesting thing happened with the ship. People aren’t in accidents because there’s nobody driving. There’s nobody taking motorcycle rides down the West Side Highway at a hundred miles an hour. People are away so people aren’t being injured. Now they’re asking whether or not we could open up the ship for COVID."
2020-04-04,47:39,Donald Trump,"We have given the governor of New York more than anybody has ever been given in a long time, I’ll just say. I was going to say in history, but in a long time. And I think he’s happy. But I think that, because I watched what he said today, and it was fine. I wouldn’t say gracious, it wasn’t gracious, it was okay. I must tell you, Gavin Newsome has been gracious, Los Angeles, California, the job we’ve done, and all of California."
2020-04-04,48:04,Unnamed,Why does that matter if they’re gracious or not gracious?
2020-04-04,48:08,Donald Trump,"It doesn’t matter, but I think when we’ve given as much as we’ve given to New York, somebody should say, “Nice.” I’ll tell you who has been very nice: Mayor de Blasio has been very nice. He understands what we’ve given him. We brought him some more ventilators to yesterday. But nobody has been given like New York. And I know he appreciates it, he just can’t quite get the words out. But that’s okay."
2020-04-04,48:33,Unnamed,"But when he says that he needs 20,000-"
2020-04-04,48:36,Donald Trump,"Yes, go ahead?"
2020-04-04,48:38,Unnamed,Back to Dr. Fauci’s comments-
2020-04-04,48:40,Donald Trump,To which one?
2020-04-04,48:40,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci’s comments on mitigation. On the reproductive value of the virus, the WHO had it up to 2 to 2.6, others had it a percentage point or two higher. Do we have a new number now based on those mitigation techniques? Have we managed to bring it down?"
2020-04-04,48:58,Donald Trump,"Well, doctor, I think maybe you should answer that, right? Dr. Birx, please. [crosstalk 00:49:02] Yeah, sure, go ahead."
2020-04-04,49:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You know, it’s an excellent question. And it’s why all of the modelers, and I really want to thank them again, they’re reevaluating all of their models in light of the level of the impact of the mitigation. Remember, none of us had really been through this before, so when we modeled school closures, and distancing, and staying at home, and all of these pieces, that had never really come into the model before. They’re working on that very diligently now. Of course, just to be clear, we won’t know how valid the models are until we move all the way through the epidemic."
2020-04-04,49:39,Dr. Deborah Birx,"what we’re triangulating right now, and instead of working on our R not, we’re looking at testing and triangulating, testing, positive cases, hospitalizations, ICUs and, of course, the recoveries, because that’s also very important to us. I think it’s very important that the American people know that there are equal number of States with less than 5% positives despite high levels of testing. So there are States that are mitigating and making this work. There are also the States that you know of, the 18 States that have the larger outbreaks, and we’re watching them very carefully, triangulating for them all of the information to ensure that clients who come to the hospital are cared for."
2020-04-04,50:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And then there are states in the middle that we’re trying to figure out are they changing or not. Each of those states, and each of those epidemics within those states, may have a different R value, and that is what we’re trying to figure out. It’s very variable on each of these factors. But the bottom line is, and I think going into this weekend, it’s really important for the American people to know this, Spain and Italy are moving through this. They are seeing their number of cases drop, they’re seeing the number of people in hospitals drop. We are about, on our models and on the actual data, about 12 days behind them."
2020-04-04,51:08,Dr. Deborah Birx,"At the same time we see in the United States really good case studies of the impact that Washington state, of California, and then a series of smaller States where we’re trying to learn from them how to do surveillance. And with these new HHS Abbott ID now kits, and I just want to thank Admiral Giroir for getting them out, being able to look at testing in a more comprehensive way, so we can be doing surveillance and mitigation simultaneously so we can answer that very question. It’s going to be very difficult to answer at this moment across the United States, because each Metro cluster is on a different pathway as they move through the epidemic. And I think we just really ought to emphasize through, because we see Italy, we see Spain moving through. And we hope to be in that same position."
2020-04-04,52:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"At the same time, as the president said, he’s concerned about every single person that is succumbing to this virus. We all are. And that’s why we’re making sure that in this triangulation, they’re tracking minute-by-minute. When we say FEMA and HHS is tracking minute-by-minute the ventilator, hospital, and ICU bed need, that’s exactly what’s happening. And also being flexible and responsive. To have DOD take a thousand healthcare providers out of their medical corps is a very big deal. I was in the medical corps for 29 years. We never did that. So this is saying we respect and understand the importance and value of the American lives and doing that. But the R values will be variable by state."
2020-04-04,52:57,Donald Trump,"Before I do that, we had breaking news last night, you know that, you saw that, where I think the probable presidential candidate for the Democrats will be Joe Biden, and he agreed that I was correct when I stopped people from China very early, very, very early from coming into our country. And Dr. Fauci said that was a very big moment because it would be a much different picture we have right now had we allowed thousands and thousands of people from a specific area, I don’t have to go into it, from China, to come in highly infected. It would’ve been a very different thing."
2020-04-04,53:32,Donald Trump,"So I appreciate the fact that he did, because I was called xenophobic, racist, I was called many things when I did that very early. And I got a lot of credit for it in The Federalist because The Federalist covered the whole journey. And they said, “Trump was,” … I didn’t speak to the author, respected author. They said, “Trump was right at every single move, and on top of that, he was going through a fake impeachment, a hoax.” I was going through a hoax when I made the decision. And that does take a little time, and certainly a little-"
2020-04-04,54:03,Donald Trump,"… When I made the decision and that does take a little time and certainly a little thinking time, but I appreciated the fact that Joe Biden announced last night that he now agrees that I was correct. You saw the report come out that I was correct when I stopped people from China coming in at a very early date."
2020-04-04,54:19,Unnamed,"Mr. President, can we talk about Captain Crozier of the USS Roosevelt?"
2020-04-04,54:23,Donald Trump,Which one? What?
2020-04-04,54:23,Unnamed,Captain Crozier that was removed as the commander of USS Roosevelt. I don’t know if you saw the videos of sailors cheering for him as he left. Our reporting shows that some sailors have said that they are worried to re-enlist because they are not convinced that commanders are taking care of their health and taking care of them.
2020-04-04,54:42,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-04-04,54:43,Unnamed,What do you say to them? And how does removing this captain-?
2020-04-04,54:44,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t know much about it. I can only tell you this. Here we have one of the greatest ships in the world, nuclear aircraft carrier, incredible ship with thousands and thousands of people. And you had about 120 that were infected."
2020-04-04,54:59,Donald Trump,"Now, I guess the captain stopped in Vietnam and people got off in Vietnam. Perhaps you don’t do that in the middle of a pandemic or something that looked like it was going to be. History would say you don’t necessarily stop and let your sailors get off, number one. But more importantly, he wrote a letter. The letter was a five-page letter from a captain, and the letter was all over the place. That’s not appropriate. I don’t think that’s appropriate. And these are tough people. These are tough, strong people. I thought it looked terrible, to be honest with you."
2020-04-04,55:31,Donald Trump,"Now they made their decision. I didn’t make the decision. Secretary of Defense was involved and a lot of people were involved. I thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter? I mean, this isn’t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that’s nuclear powered, and he shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter. He could call and ask and suggest. But he stopped in Vietnam. A lot of people got off the boat. They came back and they had infection. And I thought it was inappropriate for the captain of a ship to do."
2020-04-04,56:04,Unnamed,Were you consulted about his removal?
2020-04-04,56:05,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to comment as to whether or not, but I agree with their decision 100%."
2020-04-04,56:09,Donald Trump,"In the back, please."
2020-04-04,56:11,Unnamed,Joe Biden actually just attacked you in a tweet. I don’t know if you have seen it.
2020-04-04,56:16,Donald Trump,He just what?
2020-04-04,56:17,Unnamed,Attacked you. He just said-
2020-04-04,56:17,Donald Trump,"Oh, he didn’t write anything. Look, he has people, he has professionals from the Democrats writing."
2020-04-04,56:21,Unnamed,"Mr. President, let me just read what he said. He said, “Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it.”"
2020-04-04,56:29,Unnamed,"How do you respond to that, sir?"
2020-04-04,56:32,Donald Trump,"He didn’t write that. That was done by a Democrat operative. He doesn’t write. He’s probably not even watching right now. And if he is, he doesn’t understand what he’s watching. But just so you understand, it was very nice what they wrote. I don’t know. You know, they released it in a strange time. It’s sort of a strange time to release something like that. But he admitted I was right."
2020-04-04,56:54,Donald Trump,"And if you read the Federalist story, which most of you won’t because you don’t want to, but you’d learn something because it goes to a chart, times. I was early. Dr. Fauci, I don’t think he’s changed his mind, but he said it was a very important step when we stopped China from coming in from the specific area that was heavily infected. We’d have a whole different thing right now, so I don’t really know what Joe Biden said. I don’t really care."
2020-04-04,57:21,Donald Trump,"And again, I see every once in a while I’ll say something, I’ll make a speech and then it’ll be critiqued and I’ll get this beautiful, brilliant critique. Joe Biden didn’t write that. Joe Biden didn’t write that. He wished he did, but he didn’t."
2020-04-04,57:35,Donald Trump,"Go ahead. Please, back."
2020-04-04,57:37,Unnamed,"Sure. I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci a quick question. China has warned at a resurgence of the virus. Has the U.S. developed a plan if in fact the second wave of the virus does, in fact, occur here in the country?"
2020-04-04,57:49,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yes, we do. I mean, one of the things that obviously is parallel with thinking about the possibility, as I mentioned a little while ago, of mitigation allowing us to turn the corner, very much on the front burner, is what happens when we do, because the risk of there being a resurgent is real."
2020-04-04,58:06,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So what we need to do, and I believe I said this before, but it’s worth repeating, that what we need to have in place, and we will have that in place, is that as you then pull back, you have to have the capability, in a very pristine, precise way, do the kind of containment when you do see it."
2020-04-04,58:25,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Because, remember, when you get to mitigation, containment takes the back seat because you’re just struggling to mitigate. But when you get it down, you need to make sure it doesn’t resurge. That will require the ability to test, to identify, to isolate, and to do contact tracing. That’s what we have to have in place and hopefully we will at the time that we then pull back."
2020-04-04,58:48,Unnamed,"Question for Dr. Hahn of the FDA. You mentioned the plasma, sir. So these are the plasma that people that were infected that have now either recovered or they’re doing well enough and then they’re transferring it to, is it family members? Can you walk us through? That’s working? Is it kind of like a case by case basis or hospitals? What are the results from that? I just was not familiar with that."
2020-04-04,59:06,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So this is a situation where someone who’s recovered from the virus doesn’t have the virus in their system at all. You can take plasma, and this is a pretty routine procedure. You can actually donate a couple times a week, couple times a month, frankly, and give that plasma."
2020-04-04,59:21,Dr. Steven Hahn,"That plasma contains the proteins in the blood that have the antibodies against the virus. You can take that, process it, and then give it to someone who’s ill. And so that allows you to transfer the immunity. Doesn’t have to be matched by family or anything like that."
2020-04-04,59:35,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Since last Tuesday, the Tuesday before last, we’ve allowed academic centers and other laboratories and hospitals around the country to do this on a compassionate use basis. What we did was we pulled this together in what’s called an expanded access program and run it through the Red Cross because they’ve got the greatest system and capacity for doing this. And this allows us to scale up so that when people get sick, we can actually have these donated plasma packs given to the patients who are sick."
2020-04-04,01:00:01,Unnamed,"So are people going to be donating plasma enough to meet. Obviously, some of us don’t know if we had it or in recovery. What should people be doing?"
2020-04-04,01:00:07,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So we’ve started with the Red Cross in this program. We made an announcement yesterday. We are planning to actually scale that up and we’ll have more information this week, because we want to make sure we have the systems in place. It’s a superb question."
2020-04-04,01:00:19,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir."
2020-04-04,01:00:20,Donald Trump,"All right, Jeff, got it?"
2020-04-04,01:00:21,Unnamed,"Mr. President, can you clarify the situation with 3M right now? Germany said that it was an act of piracy that 200,000 masks were apparently diverted from Thailand to the United States instead of to Berlin. Is that a miscommunication? Did that actually happen? And should 3M be fulfilling contracts?"
2020-04-04,01:00:38,Donald Trump,"We’re very disappointed in 3M. They should be taking care of our country, and they can sell to others, but they should be taking care of our country. The people that have dealt with them have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month. They don’t like the way 3M has treated our country. They don’t frankly like the representatives of 3M and no act of … You said piracy, right? Piracy?"
2020-04-04,01:01:06,Unnamed,For German [crosstalk 01:01:05].
2020-04-04,01:01:07,Donald Trump,"There’s been no act of piracy. No, there’s been no act of piracy. It’s the opposite. 3M has not treated our country well, and if they do, great, and if they don’t, they’re going to have a hell of a price to pay."
2020-04-04,01:01:18,Donald Trump,"Okay. I say it that way, and I watched him on television on something talking about how this is so hard to believe, so hard to fathom. They ought to get their act together because I got involved and I looked at what happened and 3M has not treated our country well."
2020-04-04,01:01:36,Unnamed,Could you just clarify about that German order?
2020-04-04,01:01:37,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-04-04,01:01:39,Unnamed,"Was that diverted, sir, or what that not diverted?"
2020-04-04,01:01:40,Donald Trump,We’ll get you the information.
2020-04-04,01:01:44,Unnamed,"I have a question for Dr. Fauci. I was wondering about what you’re seeing as far as lupus patients in regards to coronavirus. I know the President mentioned this earlier, but what does the medicine say?"
2020-04-04,01:01:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What is the question? Is that, what is the incidence of coronavirus-?"
2020-04-04,01:01:57,Unnamed,"Yeah. If you have lupus, do you have a greater chance of getting coronavirus?"
2020-04-04,01:01:59,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah. Yeah. Right now this is being looked at in a natural history study. We don’t have any definitive information to be able to make any comment on that. It’s an obvious good question because it might be a way for us to get some interesting and potentially important data as to the role of those medications, but that’s something that is now being looked at, but we don’t have any data to be able to say anything definitively."
2020-04-04,01:02:24,Donald Trump,"And I hope they use the hydroxychloroquine, and they can also do it with Z-Pak subject to your doctor’s approval and all of that. But I hope they use it because, I’ll tell you what, what do you have to lose? In some cases they’re in bad shape. What do you have to lose? It’s been out there for a long time and I hope they use it and they’re going to look at the … With doctors, work with doctors, get what you have to get."
2020-04-04,01:02:50,Donald Trump,"But we have it stockpiled and we have a lot of it and we’re getting more of it. And as I told you, I spoke to Prime Minister Modi. We’re getting more of it, but we have a lot of it and I hope they use it because it’s been used for a long time and therefore it’s passed the safety test. FDA has been terrific. Dr Hahn, I appreciate it very much, too."
2020-04-04,01:03:11,Donald Trump,"But I’ve seen some results now. It’s early, I guess. It’s early, and they should look at the lupus thing. I don’t know what it says, but there’s a rumor out there that, because it takes care of lupus very effectively as I understand it. It’s a drug that’s used for lupus."
2020-04-04,01:03:27,Donald Trump,So there’s a study out there that says people that have lupus haven’t been catching this virus. No. Maybe it’s true. Maybe it’s not. Why don’t you investigate that?
2020-04-04,01:03:36,Donald Trump,"And there’s also other studies with the malaria that the malaria countries have very little people that take this drug for malaria, which is very effective for malaria, that those countries have very little of this virus. I don’t know. You’re going to check it out. But I think people should … If it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it. Okay. I may take it, and I’ll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it."
2020-04-04,01:04:05,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-04-04,01:04:06,Unnamed,"Mr. President, last week, the last couple days, you’ve been really optimistic about Russia and Saudi Arabia coming together on the deal on oil, but in the last 24 hours, the OPEC-Plus has been pushed back. They’ve traded some [crosstalk 01:04:18]."
2020-04-04,01:04:18,Donald Trump,"OPEC can do whatever. Look, I’ve been against OPEC all my life because what is it? It’s an illegal, you could call it a cartel, you could call it a monopoly. You got a lot of different names for it, but it broke down very violently, very violently. So I don’t care about OPEC. I really don’t. I couldn’t care less about OPEC."
2020-04-04,01:04:37,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:04:37].
2020-04-04,01:04:37,Donald Trump,"Let me just say it. No, no. I think they’re going to settle it. You know why? Because they’re going to be destroyed. They’re destroying themselves if they don’t. Russia, it’s a very important, and we had a very good conversation, President Putin and myself, very good, but Russia, a big part of their economic wellbeing is from oil. Well, oil is at a record low. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. It’s actually lower than you even think and it’s to their advantage. Obviously it’s to Saudi Arabia’s advantage."
2020-04-04,01:05:06,Donald Trump,They told me they are discussing. Saudi Arabia went much further than that. He thinks that a deal is going to be made at 10 million barrels reduction and maybe more than that. He actually indicated it would most likely be much more than that.
2020-04-04,01:05:21,Donald Trump,"So we’ll see what happens. I mean we’re going to see what happens, but as far as OPEC is concerned, I was against OPEC for years and years be."
2020-04-04,01:05:28,Donald Trump,"cause I thought it was very unfair to our country. The beautiful thing is we have built one of the great … One of the things we’ve done is created so much we produce. We’re the number one producer in the world right now. I don’t like it for a different reason because it’s going to hurt a lot of jobs in our country, this price. It’s going to hurt a lot of jobs."
2020-04-04,01:05:47,Donald Trump,"Now, with all of that being said, people are going to be driving, paying 90 cents a gallon. Did you hear that? What’s that, 1952 or something? All right, so from that standpoint …"
2020-04-04,01:05:58,Donald Trump,"But you know what? I am a big believer in our great energy business, and we’re going to take care of our energy business, and if I have to do tariffs on oil coming from outside, or if I have to do something to protect thousands and tens of thousands of energy workers and our great companies that produce all these jobs, I’ll do whatever I have to do. Okay?"
2020-04-04,01:06:18,Donald Trump,"Yeah ma’am, go ahead. Yeah."
2020-04-04,01:06:20,Unnamed,"You tweeted a little while ago about how sad it is for kids they don’t have Little League right now, but I’m wondering if you’re willing to share about your youngest son and how he’s dealing with life and sheltering in place, not going to school, no sports."
2020-04-04,01:06:35,Donald Trump,"Well, he’s a good athlete and he loves soccer and he’s like everyone else. Everything’s shut down. He’s in his room. He’s happy, but he’s not as happy as he could be. He’d like to be playing sports, Barron, and let’s see what happens."
2020-04-04,01:06:53,Donald Trump,But we have to get back. We have to get back. Remember that. We have to get back and we have to get back soon. Okay.
2020-04-04,01:07:00,Unnamed,"Mr. President, on the jobs reports numbers-"
2020-04-04,01:07:03,Donald Trump,"You guys ever stop? You want to keep going for a little while, huh? I mean, do you ever stop? How many times you ask, and in many cases it’s the same. Actually, a lot of good questions. Go ahead, but keep going. Yes."
2020-04-04,01:07:15,Unnamed,"Yes, sir."
2020-04-04,01:07:15,Donald Trump,"So you’re not going to blame me that I kept it going too long. People said, “Oh, he kept …” every time you’ll ask it. No, I mean, no, it’s amazing. Every hand went up. I thought we’ve gone through … I think every single hand went up the last time. You know what it shows you? It shows you that you love what you do. Go ahead."
2020-04-04,01:07:33,Unnamed,"We do love what we do, sir."
2020-04-04,01:07:34,Donald Trump,"You do. No, you do, and some of you do it well. Not all of you. Go ahead. I’m not looking at you, by the way."
2020-04-04,01:07:42,Unnamed,"So we didn’t get the jobs reports numbers yesterday. Obviously that’s kind of a small portion because it’s only the first half of March. Was there anything in there that was any sign of optimism? Obviously, we all saw the numbers down in retail, down in hospitality. Was there anything that … You said, “Okay, maybe with this virus we will see some sort of net gain in jobs”?"
2020-04-04,01:08:01,Donald Trump,"Look, the job numbers are what they are. We asked everybody to go home, don’t work. So the numbers are going to be astronomical. We understand that. I understood that. I know somebody said the numbers are meaningless and then they took that to mean obs don’t mean anything. And it was just another fake news story."
2020-04-04,01:08:22,Donald Trump,"It wasn’t me that said it, by the way. It was a very smart person, but they meant it by saying it really is what … That’s why I answer your question very carefully. The numbers are what they are. We know the numbers were going to be massive because we told everybody to go home and lock your door essentially, right? Don’t come to work. You can’t come to work. Don’t go outside, don’t breathe, don’t do anything."
2020-04-04,01:08:44,Donald Trump,"We got to open up our country, but I know, I know that it’s coming back, and in my opinion, it will come back very strong. There’s a tremendous energy, there’s a tremendous demand and, some good things have happened. I don’t know."
2020-04-04,01:08:59,Donald Trump,"There’s one habit that, as you know, most of you, a lot of you have covered me a long time before I did this, I was never a big believer in shaking hands. But I decided if you don’t shake hands, you’re not going to be winning a lot of contests. Right now, I’m not sure you have to shake hands anymore. A couple of people have told me, Debra, you told me, that if we didn’t shake hands, the incidence of flu, flu is a big deal also, and that flu might be cut down in half. Who knew that shaking hands was such a bad thing?"
2020-04-04,01:09:28,Donald Trump,"I felt it. I always felt it and I was never to a point where I can’t shake somebody’s hand. And I knew people like that, too, but there weren’t too many of them. But when I ran for office, all of a sudden I’m shaking hundreds of hands, and if I don’t, I wouldn’t even be standing here."
2020-04-04,01:09:43,Donald Trump,"But I think that’s a custom that maybe people don’t have to. We have to get close together. We have to sit together at the stadiums, we have to sit next to each other and wrestle. All that stuff is going to happen. But I think the concept of shaking hands may be something that’s going to be a little bit from the past. Let’s see what happens. Maybe they’ll go right back to shaking hands."
2020-04-04,01:10:02,Unnamed,My last question of the day. How about that?
2020-04-04,01:10:03,Donald Trump,Good.
2020-04-04,01:10:03,Unnamed,"Is there anything you want people to do to show their support, especially if we have two doctors up there, to show their support for the medical community? Is there something that we’ve seen people clapping when nurses leave. I’ve seen [crosstalk 01:10:14]."
2020-04-04,01:10:14,Donald Trump,"Well, we’ve seen a lot of that yet. You might say something. I have seen such support. I saw this morning where everyone’s, they’re clapping for fire department, they’re clapping for peace, but they are really, these people are …"
2020-04-04,01:10:25,Donald Trump,"You know what they’re like? Tony, they’re like warriors. Mike, they’re like warriors. They were going in Elmhurst hospital, which has been tragic. Right near where I grew up in Queens, going in. And the people in buildings, they’re going … They’re the rock stars. They’re warriors. Nurses, doctors, first responders, what they’re going through."
2020-04-04,01:10:50,Donald Trump,"And they don’t even know what’s going to happen. They go in and, by the way, even if they have great equipment, they’re catching it. They have good equipment, they catch it. They catch it with good, with bad. It is evil. But, Tony, you might say something, and, Mike, you may say something about that. Yeah."
2020-04-04,01:11:06,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I’m glad you brought up that question because I don’t think people can really fully appreciate the extraordinary effort of these people. It’s amazing. I did all of my medical training in New York City in a big, busy New York City hospital at a time when it was just what you normally see in a hospital."
2020-04-04,01:11:27,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I came to NIH and I spent about five to eight years in the very early years of the AIDS epidemic, which was just the darkest years of my life because almost every single one of my patients died. And yet, as we knew epidemiologically that there was very little risk, there was a small risk, but very little risk of getting infected from a patient to see now, with these brave warriors are doing in the hospitals, not only giving life saving treatment to people, but every single day putting themselves at risk for themselves and their family."
2020-04-04,01:12:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,I just think that the American public owe a phenomenal debt of gratitude for these people.
2020-04-04,01:12:11,Unnamed,How do you want them to show that?
2020-04-04,01:12:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And they should just salute them at every, every ways you can. You know, when we were at war, at the height of the war in Afghanistan, in Iraq, when you’re at an airport and you’d see somebody with a uniform come by, everybody would do that. I think that’s what we should do when we see healthcare workers, just applaud them."
2020-04-04,01:12:30,Donald Trump,Pretty much what’s happening. Mike? Please.
2020-04-04,01:12:38,Mike Pence,"The stories are incredibly moving about what health care workers who are doing every day. It’s not just that they’re going back into the hospital. In places like New York, in New Jersey, earlier than that, and in Washington state and California where this first began. It’s not just that they’re providing care to people, but because of the nature of how contagious the coronavirus is, they’re also supplementing for family."
2020-04-04,01:13:11,Mike Pence,"I mean, that’s what gets to me. When I hear the stories that understandably in nursing homes and in hospitals, they’re restricting visitors, and they should, to prevent the spread of the virus to be brought into the hospital or to be brought out. And so to hear the stories of health care workers who are holding up an iPhone while someone who’s critically ill with the coronavirus may well be saying their last goodbyes to their family, and then to be there in those moments."
2020-04-04,01:13:46,Mike Pence,"Our healthcare workers are, they’re not just doctors and nurses today. They’re supplementing for family for people all across the country. And I just think, tomorrow’s Palm Sunday, it’s Holy week in the great Christian tradition, and I have people ask me from time to time, send me an email or on the many conference calls that we have, they said, “What can we be praying about?” And my first thought is with the families who have lost loved ones and the patients who are struggling with coronavirus."
2020-04-04,01:14:21,Mike Pence,"But during this very special week, I just encourage people to pray for our healthcare workers. Pray for them and their families. They are really the hands and feet every day, not just of healthcare, but at the heart of the American people. And we are all grateful for them every hour of the day."
2020-04-04,01:14:40,Donald Trump,"Mike, thank you."
2020-04-04,01:14:41,Donald Trump,"And think also about the Army Corps of Engineers. It’s a little different depending on where are and where they’re working, but the Army Corps of Engineers throwing up a hospital in New York City, 2,500 beds in three days. I mean think of that."
2020-04-04,01:14:56,Donald Trump,"And FEMA, what they’re doing, and the National Guard is now delivering for the states because the states were unable to get, we’d drop it at a big warehouse where we’re told to drop it, and some of the states were unable to bring it from the warehouse to the site. So we got the National Guard to become a delivery service if you can believe it, and they would bring it. And some of those sites were dangerous sites. They were very dangerous sites. Think of that."
2020-04-04,01:15:23,Donald Trump,"It’s been amazing. It’s been amazing. I just think I’ve never seen anything like it. I’m so proud of this country. And really it’s a world problem, and some countries in the world are just handling it so well. You know, again, I keep saying it’s 151. That was as of two or three days ago. It’s probably more. Some people said they didn’t know there were that many countries. That’s how big this is."
2020-04-04,01:15:46,Donald Trump,"And Mike said something else. So the Palm Sunday, tomorrow, think of it, we’re not going to churches on Palm Sunday, but think of next Sunday, Easter. And I brought it up before. I said, ” Maybe we could allow special for churches. Maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them with great separation outside on Easter Sunday.” I don’t know. It’s something we we should talk about. But somebody did say that, well, then you’re sort of opening it up to that little, do we want to take a chance on doing that when we’ve been doing so well. But Easter Sunday, Palm Sunday, I’m going to be watching tomorrow live from Riverside, California, great church, but I’m going to be watching on a computer, right on a laptop. I think on Easter, maybe I’ll be watching from a laptop as opposed …"
2020-04-04,01:16:43,Donald Trump,"So how sad is it that we have Easter Palm and Easter Sunday and people are watching on laptops and computers? It’s sad, but the job that this whole country has done is amazing."
2020-04-04,01:16:59,Donald Trump,"But I’ll say this. Our medical professionals, what they’ve done, because they walk into those hospitals, you see them putting on their gear and they’re putting it on as they’re walking through the front doors. And some of those people are going to die. They’re going to die. You know, it’s like incredible."
2020-04-04,01:17:17,Donald Trump,"And we can say what we want, Tony and Deb, about young and medium aged. Plenty of those people dying, too. You know, it generally hits the older people where they have problems. It hits young people, too, and it hits middle aged people, too."
2020-04-04,01:17:34,Donald Trump,"But these people are walking into hospitals and I watch. I think it’s incredible. And they’re putting their outfit, they’re getting into it, and they’re going in. They go in. It’s like a war."
2020-04-04,01:17:49,Donald Trump,"Again, there’s never been anything so contagious as this. In 1917, it was vicious if you got it, but it wasn’t contagious like this. Now in 1917, had they had the internet and all the means of communication, they could have practiced distancing. You know, by the time people started thinking in terms in those terms, they lost, I guess, 75 to 100 million people. So that’s modern day. Great thing that happened."
2020-04-04,01:18:18,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-04-04,01:18:20,Unnamed,"Yeah, just on antibodies. To what extent do you think that you can use antibody tests to determine who can go back to work and [inaudible 01:18:28]."
2020-04-04,01:18:29,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t know. I’d rather leave that to the doctor. Doctor, do you have an answer to that?"
2020-04-04,01:18:38,Dr. Steven Hahn,We think it’ll be a tool.
2020-04-04,01:18:39,Dr. Steven Hahn,[crosstalk 01:18:34].
2020-04-04,01:18:39,Dr. Steven Hahn,"We think it will be a tool to help us get people back to work. It’ll be additional information because, as you know, if you have an antibody, that means you are exposed and have recovered from it. That, with the information about diagnosis, should help."
2020-04-04,01:18:50,Unnamed,But how quickly can you scale up this testing to determine on a large scale how many people can go back to work that have these antibodies?
2020-04-04,01:19:00,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So as you know, a couple of weeks ago we provided a great deal of regulatory flexibility around this. A lot of great developers have been working on this. Dr. Burkes put a call out to the academic labs around the country to do this, and we’ve been working very closely with a number of manufacturers, so we think that it can be scaled up relatively quickly."
2020-04-04,01:19:19,Unnamed,"Mr. President, a question for Dr. Fauci. In a recent interview, you had said that you knew the 15 days guidance would not be enough. I wanted to ask your confidence level about the 30 day guidance and whether it will be enough."
2020-04-04,01:19:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You know, it’s tough to talk about levels of confidence, but I can tell you one thing that I feel strongly, that if we do in a very proactive way what I said in my opening comments and people literally across the country as a baseline have that physical separation, and as we’ve mentioned up here, there’ll be varying degrees of that depending upon whether you’re in New York City or you’re in a place that’s less, but every place, everybody should be doing some degree of this physical separation."
2020-04-04,01:20:08,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"If we do that, again, I have confidence that what we will see is the turning around of the curve, whether or not it will be all the way down to what we want, it’s impossible to say. I would be foolish to say that, but the one thing I am confident in, so let’s take this to the bank, that mitigation works. It does. We’ve seen it in other countries. We’ve seen it in our own country, and that’s the reason why I keep coming up at every chance I get to plea with the American people to please take a look at those guidelines that the Vice President keeps putting up with his chart. Because every single one of those points has something to do with physical separation."
2020-04-04,01:20:46,Donald Trump,"And mitigation does work. But, again, we’re not going to destroy our country. We have to get back because at a certain point, you’ll lose more people this way, through all of the problems caused, than you will-"
2020-04-04,01:21:03,Donald Trump,"This way through all of the problems caused, then you will with what we’re doing right now… What we’re doing right now, I think it’s going to be very successful. But you know what? I don’t know. We have a big decision to make at a certain point. Okay? We have a big decision to make. We went this extra period of time, but I said it from the beginning. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and we cannot let that happen. We have an incredible country. We were having the greatest period in our country’s history from an economic standpoint in many other ways. We cannot let this continue. So at a certain point some hard decisions are going to have to be made. Go ahead."
2020-04-04,01:21:44,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, ventilator manufacturers are doubling, tripling, even quadrupling their production in some cases."
2020-04-04,01:21:49,Donald Trump,That’s true.
2020-04-04,01:21:50,Jeff (Reporter),"Yet, medical experts and some of these manufacturers are predicting that there will still be shortages of tens of thousands of ventilators. Is it time for you to level with the American public that there likely will be shortages of ventilators in some cases?"
2020-04-04,01:22:05,Donald Trump,"Could be. I mean, it could be you have shortages, and it could also be that you have some that have way overestimated the number of ventilators they need. We think that we have a good amount ready to move. I mean, literally, like an army, they’re ready to move to any hotspot. But some of the ones that you’re talking about, always a nasty question from CNN."
2020-04-04,01:22:27,Jeff (Reporter),Why is that a nasty question?
2020-04-04,01:22:29,Donald Trump,"Because I think that frankly [crosstalk 01:22:31] because you know what you’ve asked that question about 10 times over the course of about a month. Look, we’re mobilized and ready to go. We have a lot of ventilators ready to go, and if we had given them all out, we wouldn’t, and you would be overstocked in many areas. What we’re doing is we have a very good plan to take from some areas. Even though we have the 10 or almost the 10,000, we’re also taking from areas that won’t be as badly hit as today we think they will be. There will be some areas hit harder than we think, and there’s nothing that Deborah or Tony or any of these professionals can do about it."
2020-04-04,01:23:08,Donald Trump,"This thing moves in a lot of ways, but what we’re going to do is we are going to have, and you look at us compared to a lot of other countries, we’re in much better shape. But these professionals have done an amazing job. Now, over the next week and two weeks, it’s going to be a very, very deadly period, unfortunately. But we’re going to make it so that we lose as few lives as possible, and I think we’re going to be successful. I think we already are successful in that regard. When you look at that graph and you see all of the bumps, if you want to call it, at a very low level, and you see a couple at a higher level, they were tough, but you see all of those levels."
2020-04-04,01:23:50,Donald Trump,"You know when you look at and when you hear about Italy and then you hear about France and then you hear about… What we have is we have many Italy’s all over. They’re like countries. California is a country, New York is a country. If you look at them from the standpoint of what we’re talking about. We have many like country spots. Some are hotspots, and there’s nothing we’re going to do about it. One of the biggest surprises is Louisiana because it started off so good, and then all of a sudden it shot up like a rocket, but we are going to try and have ventilators wherever we possibly can. Jeff, go ahead."
2020-04-04,01:24:25,Jeff (Reporter),Herculean effort of some of these companies to ramp up production as fast as possible.
2020-04-04,01:24:29,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-04-04,01:24:29,Jeff (Reporter),It still won’t be enough.
2020-04-04,01:24:30,Donald Trump,"Well, New York wanted 40,000 ventilators. Okay, 40,000. Think of what 40,000 is? It’s like cars. It’s a big project. It’s an expensive product. I mean, some of them a $50,000 a piece. I saw one the other day, 55,000, that was before they start playing the games with supply and demand okay? Some are very, very, you call them luxury. Some are not. But frankly these are very expensive products. These are very high tech projects and products, and they take a period of time."
2020-04-04,01:25:00,Donald Trump,"We have thousands of them being built right now. Some will be ready, and we’re going to have extra, and we’ll keep them at hospitals. But a lot of hospitals, a lot of states had the chance of getting ventilators, and they turned those ventilators down so they could spend their money at something else. In a way I understand that, because who thinks a thing like this? It’s not a knock. If I’m told, perhaps in New York, you can spend one billion dollars on ventilators and get 16,000 or a massive number of ventilators that they’ve been offered over the years. Or you can build a new bridge or road or something. I mean, I understand how that works. I’m not blaming anybody. I’m just saying a lot of the States had chances of stockpiling a lot of ventilators. They didn’t do it, and I think we’re doing a very good job in helping them out place. Please, Jeff. It’s a very fair question. I understand that question very well. Yeah."
2020-04-04,01:25:53,Jeff (Reporter),Follow up on what you and the others have been saying today about it being a deadly week or two coming. Can you give us a sense of perhaps [inaudible 01:26:01] of what that means numerically?
2020-04-04,01:26:02,Donald Trump,"I’d like to ask also, yeah. I’d like to say we know pretty much the line of attack. We know the numbers. The numbers are the numbers. They seem to be checking out, unfortunately. Or in some cases they’re on the low side, which we’re very happy. We want to keep them on the very low side, and that’s where we’re headed. I think that’s maybe where we’re headed. But I’d like to ask maybe you and Tony, where is the week or the number of days of greatest attack? What will be our worst day, if that’s possible to determine? I think that’s what you’re asking, right?"
2020-04-04,01:26:37,Jeff (Reporter),How many deaths exactly are you expecting?
2020-04-04,01:26:40,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So as you can look and the places that are the most difficult hit right now: the Detroit area, the New York area, the Louisiana area. We are doing it by the counties in those States because mostly it’s Metro areas and the bedroom communities around those Metro areas. Because people went to work and got exposed and came home and exposed other. If you look out in New York now you see that it’s in Long Island and is out in Suffolk County and Nassau County. All of those counties, Wayne and Oakland, they’re all on the upside of their curve of mortality. So you know when you get to the peak you come down the other side."
2020-04-04,01:27:26,Jeff (Reporter),When will that peak be?
2020-04-04,01:27:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So by the predictions that are in that healthdata.org, they are predicting in those three hotspots, all of them hitting together in the next six to seven days."
2020-04-04,01:27:41,Jeff (Reporter),Are you thinking tens of thousands of deaths in that period of time?
2020-04-04,01:27:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You can go to the website. It’s variable. Each one of those communities is different. But you know where New York is, how much their mortality has been, and you know what we’re seeing today are the people who were infected two or three weeks ago. If mitigation in New York worked and we believe it is working, the cases are going to start to go down, but the mortality will be a lag behind that. Because of the comorbidities and other conditions. So that’s why all of the predictions are that this next week, and I think we said this last Sunday when we talked about the charts, and it’s difficult. We tried to prepare the American people to understand that as much as you go up, you have to come down the other side because coming down as a reflection of the cases that were coming in before."
2020-04-04,01:28:46,Jeff (Reporter),[inaudible 01:28:46] number?
2020-04-04,01:28:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I’d rather not say a number, but the numbers are available if you go to the website. I mean, you can see that there’s several hundreds per day in New York, and I think Governor Como has talked about that increasing still into the five, six, 700 range a day. So that’s very concerning to us. We again applaud the healthcare workers who are doing every single thing humanly possible to save more lives, and we are ensuring on a ventilator by ventilator day by day to get them there so that we can say, and we can be there when they need it. Because we are supposed to be that group that comes in after all of the resources are exhausted, and we really applaud what Oregon did, and we really applaud what the governor is doing about moving between the states, between the different counties to bring them to New York because that’s what’s needed today. A different place will be needed tomorrow."
2020-04-04,01:29:53,Jeff (Reporter),"You mentioned, just to follow up on something that apparently you said yesterday that you had some concerns about Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Washington DC. Could you expand on that?"
2020-04-04,01:30:00,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’re watching them because they are starting to go on that upside of the curve. We’re hoping and believing that if people mitigate strongly, the work that they did over the last two weeks will blunt that curve, and they won’t have the same upward slope and peak that New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and part of Rhode Island are having. So the next two weeks are extraordinarily important, and that’s why I think you’ve heard from Dr. Fauci, from myself, from the President and the Vice President, that this is the moment to do everything that you can on the presidential guidelines. This is the moment to not be going to the grocery store and not going to the pharmacy, but doing everything you can to keep your family and your friends safe. That means everybody doing the six feet distancing, washing your hands."
2020-04-04,01:30:56,Donald Trump,Go ahead. [inaudible 01:30:57].
2020-04-04,01:30:57,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So, I mean ditto to everything that Dr. Birx said, but also to emphasize why it’s so important to do that because we’re looking at three or four really key hotspots that are still going up. It’s absolutely essential that the ones that are down at that lower level that Dr. Burke showed the other day, those communities where they’re still going up, we’ve got to make sure we don’t have multiple waves of peaks. That’s going to be the answer to the question of when we can start pulling back because if you keep having multiple peaks and different waves, that’s going to make it very difficult."
2020-04-04,01:31:36,Jeff (Reporter),"[inaudible 01:31:36] Exactly what I said just before, and I keep repeating. Just make sure everybody does at least the minimal amount of that physical separation because the virus has no place to go if you’re physically separated."
2020-04-04,01:31:52,Donald Trump,"One of the reasons that I keep talking about hydroxychloroquine is that the question that nobody ever asks, and the question that I most hate the answer to is what happens if you do have a ventilator? What are your chances? I just hope that hydroxychloroquine wins. Coupled with perhaps the Z pack, as we call it, dependent totally on your doctors, and the doctors there."
2020-04-04,01:32:27,Donald Trump,"Because you know the answer to that question. If you do have the ventilator, you know the answer to that question. I hate giving the answer, so I don’t want to get them there. I don’t want to get them there. There’s a possibility, a possibility, and I say it. What do you have to lose? I’ll say it again. What do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it, but it’s their choice, and it’s their doctor’s choice or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine. Try it, if you’d like."
2020-04-04,01:33:04,Donald Trump,"The other thing, if you have a heart condition, I understand probably you stay away from the Z pack. But that’s an antibiotic. It can clean out the lungs. The lungs are a point of attack for this horrible virus. But when you have a ventilator, don’t ask the answer because I hate it if you have it and it’s working beautifully. I don’t like the answer because it’s not a very high percentage. So I want to keep them out of ventilators. If this drug works, it will be, not a game changer, because that’s not a nice enough term. It will be wonderful. It’ll be so beautiful. It’ll be a gift from heaven if it works. Because when people go into those ventilators, you know the answers. I know the answers, and I’m glad you don’t write about it. Mike, please."
2020-04-04,01:34:07,Mike Pence,"Well, you’ve heard from the experts what our task force has heard. It’s going to be a difficult week for the American people. You will see testing increased around the country and so cases are going to continue to rise across America. Before I give a few facts relevant to an earlier question about ventilators, let me add my voice to what the President just said and what all the physicians who’ve spoken has said. Even though we see the losses rising in the days ahead, do not be discouraged because there is evidence across the country that Americans have been putting the social distancing and mitigation into practice, and it is making a difference. We are seeing it in the new cases that are being reported."
2020-04-04,01:35:03,Mike Pence,"Because remember, families that experience loss up to this day and in in the next week have a loved one who contracted the coronavirus in most cases more than two weeks ago. In many cases before social distancing and mitigation efforts were put into effect. So we want to encourage you, believe in the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America. Go to coronavirus.gov. Print them off again. Put them on the refrigerator and remind yourself to put them into practice."
2020-04-04,01:35:44,Mike Pence,"On the subject of ventilators, if I can amplify the point the President made, our team at FEMA is doing a remarkable job working with governors, state health officials and local hospitals, particularly focused on our priority areas. We will refer to the New York Metro area, which includes New Jersey and Connecticut. We’re focused on the New Orleans Metro area in Louisiana. We’re focusing on Detroit. We’re focusing on Chicago. These are the areas where we see the significant rise in cases, and we are surging supplies, specifically ventilators, but all personal protective equipment from FEMA to those areas."
2020-04-04,01:36:33,Mike Pence,"Just to give you a couple of examples, I spoke to governors in New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Maryland today, alone. In those cases, Governor Cuomo is actually assessing all of the available ventilators. We’ve sent 4,400 ventilators already to New York. As has already been referenced, they’re going to receive a shipment of over a thousand from overseas. Allow me to say, as I told her personally today, the governor of Oregon, Governor Kate Brown, her unilateral decision to send 140 ventilators because they felt Oregon today is in a place where they could give those ventilators to New York. To me, it was in the very highest American tradition of loving your neighbor. When I talked to Governor Cuomo, Mr. President, he actually told me they never asked Oregon for the ventilators and Governor Brown hadn’t even called him to tell him that she was doing that."
2020-04-04,01:37:34,Mike Pence,It really is remarkable. When I talked to Governor Hogan today and President and I will be speaking to all of America’s governors on Monday again. I told him how inspired I was and how he ought to spread the word to other governors in areas where they can spare resources to be joining with us at the federal level and providing them to states at the point of the need.
2020-04-04,01:37:55,Mike Pence,"But just a few for instances. As we track New Jersey, as I told Governor Phil Murphy, we deployed 200 ventilators to New Jersey today. Louisiana, where we’re monitoring literally hour by hour what’s taking place in New Orleans with some encouraging news, but still great challenges. Yesterday you heard the President say that we deployed 330,000 gowns that had been delivered to the public health systems and hospitals there. 200 ventilators."
2020-04-04,01:38:25,Mike Pence,"I spoke to governor Charlie Baker today and was able to inform him. We’re watching Boston area very closely. 100 ventilators are deploying today. I spoke to Governor Gretchen Whitmer today. Detroit is experiencing a significant number of cases. We’re watching it carefully. Today FEMA directed 300 of ventilators to Michigan. Again, as the President said, we’re all working our hearts out. But what I want to say to American families and what I want to say to healthcare workers is that we are going to identify the resources, leave no stone unturned, and we are going to focus resources on those areas in the order that they emerge."
2020-04-04,01:39:15,Mike Pence,"Now, the last thought is back on mitigation. We are hoping that we do not see other major cities in the country experience what Seattle experienced, what greater New York city area’s experiencing, what New Orleans is experiencing. That’s all in the hands of the American people today. So I just want to encourage you, coronavirus.gov. Put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines, and you will do your part to save lives, protect the American people, and ensure that we will have the resources to meet this moment wherever the need should arise."
2020-04-04,01:39:55,Unnamed,"Mr. President, do you [inaudible 01:39:55] loan program that got up and running yesterday. We’re hearing from a lot of small business owners, a lot of concerns about whether they will get this money. Some of the banks weren’t ready yesterday to start processing loans. Some banks are [crosstalk 01:40:11]."
2020-04-04,01:40:10,Donald Trump,"We’re way ahead of schedules. The banks have been great. JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, they are so far ahead. This is typical with you in particular. We hear their behind. They’re not behind. It been flawless so far, far beyond our expectations. You should say, I hear you’re doing well, but maybe… I don’t even hear of any glitch. They’ve done billions of dollars of loans to small business. These are great loans. These are loans that get immediately paid off. These are loans that get businesses back. I wish you could ask a question where something’s working so well. Now maybe things won’t work well, and I don’t mind that kind. But when something’s working so well and you ask a question in such a negative way. It’s doing great. Yeah, go ahead. [crosstalk 01:41:01]. It’s doing great. Really good. Maybe it won’t in two weeks, and I’ll respond differently, but it’s doing great. You know it and so does everyone else. Everyone’s shocked how well it’s doing."
2020-04-04,01:41:12,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 01:41:12] Who did?
2020-04-04,01:41:13,Unnamed,Dr. Burns.
2020-04-04,01:41:13,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-04-04,01:41:14,Unnamed,"Some demographics, such as seeing that men might be more susceptible to the virus. Seeing in Europe more cases among the between 30 and 50 class. Has the data that you’ve seen in the past two weeks changed that assessment? Are men more susceptible? [crosstalk 01:41:35]."
2020-04-04,01:41:34,Donald Trump,"I don’t think it’s changed much, has it?"
2020-04-04,01:41:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,The same pattern as Europe.
2020-04-04,01:41:38,Donald Trump,Same pattern. Same answer that we’ve given you for the last month.
2020-04-04,01:41:43,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:41:43] between 30 and 50 being more adversely affected than we’ve seen in Asia.
2020-04-04,01:41:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"No. Tomorrow, I’ll bring you all the graphs back so you can see it."
2020-04-04,01:41:54,Donald Trump,"We can bring an updated graph, but it’s very similar. Please."
2020-04-04,01:41:57,Unnamed,"Mr. President, a few days ago you talked about possibly restricting flights from hotspots. Where are you on that? [crosstalk 01:42:03]."
2020-04-04,01:42:03,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at it very seriously. Right now we’re dealing with governors, we’re dealing with airlines, we’re dealing with a lot of different factors. It’s a very difficult decision. We’re also doing testing, getting into planes, very strong testing. States are doing testing of people that leave planes because they don’t want to have people coming in who are infected. So understanding that and the level of testing has been enormous. Okay? Some states are saying you have to go in quarantine for two weeks if you come from certain areas. So knowing that, we’re working with the governors."
2020-04-04,01:42:37,Unnamed,"Mr. President, when you say testing, you mean domestic travel or people coming in [crosstalk 00:21:42]."
2020-04-04,01:42:42,Donald Trump,"Both. Some states are doing when they land, they are doing very strong, very powerful testing. Please go ahead."
2020-04-04,01:42:47,Unnamed,"Some airlines, sir, and they say, they don’t know what you’re talking about."
2020-04-04,01:42:49,Donald Trump,"Okay, well, then you’ll check up again."
2020-04-04,01:42:51,Unnamed,One last question on ventilators.
2020-04-04,01:42:53,Donald Trump,Governments are doing it too. Our government.go ahead.
2020-04-04,01:42:55,Unnamed,"One last question on ventilators. The governor of New York said that he received donation in ventilators from Jack Ma of Alibaba, which I think is your friend. Would you call on the business community to donate ventilators? Not necessarily to New York, but other states like Louisiana [crosstalk 00:22:11]."
2020-04-04,01:43:11,Donald Trump,"Know Jack Ma, is a friend of mine. He’s made it very possible to get about a thousand ventilators from China. But that was from him and my other friend. That was really a gift, and we appreciate it very much. It was very nice of them. All right. I think we’ve had enough. We’ll be seeing you very soon, and I’m sure that you know that all of us are going to be working very hard. We’re working very hard. We are really coming up into a time that’s going to be very horrendous. Probably a time like we haven’t seen in this country, wouldn’t you say? I mean, I don’t think we’ve seen a time like this in the country, and we’re getting to that point where it’s going to really be a some very bad numbers. We want to keep those numbers a lot lower than they would have been, and we will do that."
2020-04-04,01:43:58,Donald Trump,"We have tremendous talent working. We have tremendous people, and that includes governors. That includes everybody. Everybody’s working, but unfortunately we’re getting to that time when the numbers are going to peak, and it’s not going to be a good looking situation. I really believe we probably have never seen anything like these kinds of numbers. Maybe during the war, during a world war one or two or something. But this is a war all in to itself, and it’s a terrible thing. We will be seeing you soon. We’ll keep you totally abreast. We’re also going to be releasing new ventilator numbers because we have a lot of them coming, and a lot of them going to different locations, and we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you."
2020-04-04,01:44:53,Unnamed,"On the [inaudible 01:44:53] backlog. [inaudible 01:44:53] quick question, are we in that 24 hour window-"
2020-04-05,04:25,Donald Trump,"Okay. Thank you very much everybody. Well, these people have been working very, very hard today. I’ll tell you for a long time they’d been working, but before I begin, I want to express our nation’s well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus. All Americans are praying for him. He is a friend of mine. He’s a great gentleman and a great leader and he’s a, as you know, he was brought to the hospital today, but I’m hopeful and sure that he’s going to be fine. He’s strong man, strong person. Today every patriotic American heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey. They’ve really become a very hot zone, but some very good things are happening in New York. The first time where the deaths were less from the previous day. That’s the first drop so far, so maybe that’s a good sign."
2020-04-05,05:23,Donald Trump,"It could be and the hospital levels are starting to perhaps decrease. It’s been very short but perhaps decreased, so we wish Governor Cuomo and all of the people in New York, great and New Jersey governor is doing a great job. He’s doing a great job in New Jersey. They got hit very hard. I just want to say that the full power of the American government and American enterprises, it really is, this is an all out military operation that we’ve waged and especially over the last number of weeks, 50 states and territories have now been approved for major disaster declarations, which is very unusual thanks to the army Corps of engineers. New York city’s Javits Center is now one of the largest hospitals in the United States. It’s designated for treatment of the virus patients and staffed by hundreds of federal medical personnel deployed from two army hospital units and they’re doing a great job."
2020-04-05,06:28,Donald Trump,"This was something that we didn’t expect to do, but they needed help in New York and we sent federal troops, not only troops, we also sent a lot of very talented doctors, nurses, first responders. People are now running Javits. Also, as you know, the USNS Comfort, which is in New York, has been a lot of publicity about that coming in and all that was not supposed to be for the virus at all under any circumstances, but it looks like more and more we’re going to be using it for that. So we’ll see. That was supposed to be for people having other medical problems, but it’s very interesting because there are virtually no cars on the road, no motorcycles on the road. No anything on the road, things that would normally be taken care of, we don’t see anymore. So we haven’t seen that in a long time. It’s a perhaps a positive, but the ship is ready and if it has to, if we need it, if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that. They’d prefer not for obvious reasons, but if for any reason they need it, it’s ready, willing and able."
2020-04-05,07:37,Donald Trump,"We have the best doctors, the best military leaders, and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world, and we’re orchestrating a massive federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen or done. We’ve never done anything like this. And more and more we’re using our medical people because of the fact that jurisdiction states in particular, New York, New Jersey to Connecticut area, Long Island now has become a hotspot part of New York, sending a lot of things, a lot of supplies, and now we’re sending personnel where it’s needed, military personnel. As of Tuesday we’ll have deployed over 3,000 military and public health professionals to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and other parts of our country. 3,000 and that number is going up and we hope we’re seeing a leveling off in the hottest spots of them all. So we’ll see. You’ll be seeing that over the next few days. Let’s see what happens. But we’re prepared."
2020-04-05,08:37,Donald Trump,"In the last seven days, FEMA has airlifted critical supplies and protective equipment from every corner of our earth, they’re coming from all over the planet, including from within the United States where the equipment isn’t as necessary. Since last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered almost, listen to this, 300 million gloves, almost eight million masks and three million gowns and many more fully loaded cargo. Planes are right now on the way three big ones landed today and these supplies are being distributed directly to the hospitals and healthcare providers all across the nation so that a massive amount of material that we’re getting in is being delivered all over the country. Tomorrow we’ll deliver an additional 600,000 N95 masks to New York City to take care of the needs of the public hospital system."
2020-04-05,09:34,Donald Trump,"It was at request of Mayor De Blasio. We’ve been working great with Mayor De Blasio, getting them a lot of stuff. He’s working very hard, I can tell you that. And we’re working really very hard with New York City and with New York state and at the request of Congressman Lee Zeldin out in Long Island. We will also be delivering another 200,000 N95 masks to Suffolk County where they need it very badly, so we’re getting that out in an emergency basis. Should be there tomorrow. We’ll also be deploying millions of N95 masks to other locations that Admiral Balochik will detail shortly. The admiral will be up in just a couple of minutes. Over the last 24 hours, FEMA has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey, 500. And again, the governor has been very thankful. We’re working very hard with New Jersey including building hospitals. We’ve also sent an additional 200 ventilators to Louisiana definite hotspot, 300 to Michigan working very well, I think with the governor."
2020-04-05,10:42,Donald Trump,"Amazingly 600 will be going or have gone to Illinois and I mean there’s a governor, I hear him complaining all the time, Pritzker. I hear him. He’s always complaining and yet I just said, give me a list of a couple of the things we’ve done in Illinois and we’re building a 2,500 bed hospital in McCormick Place. That’s the big convention center in Chicago and we’re helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he’s not able to do what you’re supposed to be able to do as a governor. He has not performed well. And we’re also sending a hundred ventilators to Massachusetts, so we have 600 to Illinois. We have 100 to Massachusetts, we have 300 to Michigan, we have 200 to Louisiana. We have 500 ventilators, 500 going to New Jersey, and this is being done by FEMA, being delivered by FEMA and it’s some job."
2020-04-05,11:45,Donald Trump,"Just think of that when you think about 500 ventilators. A ventilator is a big deal. We’re also establishing a federal medical station in the Washington DC area to help Washington, D.C. and working very closely with the mayor and everybody in Washington, D.C. At the same time. Governor Inslee, we appreciate this of Washington state has returned 400 ventilators, which can now be deployed elsewhere in our country. So the state of Washington’s done very well. They won’t be needing some of the ventilators that have been sent about 400 that’s a lot. And we appreciate that he’s able to give them back. He feels confident that they are in good shape for the coming weeks until we can declare a final victory."
2020-04-05,12:31,Donald Trump,"In the days ahead, America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic. Our warriors in this life and death battle are the incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare workers on the front line of the fight. We pledge to them our eternal gratitude and everlasting support. They make all of us very proud. Our country is very proud. We have people, they love our country. The world loves our country. Most of it, probably all of it. They just don’t say it. I can report today that the United States has now tested and given results, gotten results of 1.67 million people. That’s far more than any other country has been able to do. And you remember we inherited a broken system. So a lot of this has been developed by Tuesday. 1,200 brand new rapid point of care testing kits has been produced by Abbott Laboratories. Great company, and they’ll be distributed to all of our public health labs. That’s a 15 minute test, even less as well as the Indian Health Service, the CDC, and these strategic national stockpile. So we’re going to have 1200 in on a weekly basis. We’re making a lot more, they go very fast and very accurate tests and other countries are wanting them. So at the right time we’ll be able to do that. But right now we’re getting them to all of ours."
2020-04-05,13:56,Donald Trump,"So we’ve done 1,670,000 tests. Think of that 1,670,000 tests. And we have a great system. Now we’re working with the states in almost all instances, but we have a great system. And the other thing that we bought a tremendous amount of is the hydroxy chloroquine. Hydroxy chloroquine, which I think is, you know, it’s a great malaria drug. It’s worked unbelievably. It’s a powerful drug on malaria and there are signs that it works on this, some very strong signs and in the meantime it’s been around a long time. It also works very powerfully on lupus, so there are some very strong powerful signs and we’ll have to see because again, it’s tested."
2020-04-05,14:51,Donald Trump,"Now this is a new thing that just happened to as the invisible enemy we call it. And if you can, if you have a no signs of heart problems, the azithromycin, which will kill certain things that you don’t want living within your body. It’s a powerful drug. If you don’t have a problem, a heart problem, we would say, let your doctor think about it, but as a combination, I think they’re going to be, I think there’s two things that should be looked at very strongly. Now, we have purchased and we have stockpiled 29 million pills of the hydroxy chloroquine, 29 million. A lot of drug stores have them by prescription and also, and they’re not expensive. Also, we’re sending them to various labs. Our military, we’re sending them to the hospitals, we’re sending them all over. I just think it’s something, you know the expression, I’ve used it for certain reasons."
2020-04-05,16:09,Donald Trump,"What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? And a lot of people are saying that when … and are taking it, if you’re a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good, but what do you have to lose? They say, take it, I’m not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn’t do it early. But we have some very good signs. So that’s hydroxy chloroquine and as azithromycin, and again, you have to go through your medical people get the approval. But I’ve seen things that I sort of like, so what do I know? I’m not a doctor, I’m not a doctor, but I have common sense."
2020-04-05,17:06,Donald Trump,"The FDA feels good about it. They’ve, as you know, they’ve approved it. They gave it a rapid approved approval. And the reason because it’s been out there for a long time and they know the side effects and they also know the potential. So based on that, we have sent it throughout the country. We have it stockpiled about 29 million doses, 29 million doses. We have a lot of it. We hope it works. Driven by the goal of the brightest minds in science. We have the brightest minds in science, but we were driven by the goal of getting rid of this plague, getting rid of this scourge, getting rid of this virus. These brilliant minds are working on the most effective antiviral therapies and vaccines. We are working very, very hard. I have met many of the doctors that are doing it. These are doctors that are working so hard on vanquishing the virus."
2020-04-05,18:17,Donald Trump,"Staying, we strongly recommend staying at home, practicing vigorous hygiene and maintaining social distance so you’re just not going to catch it. It’s the most effective weapon in this war. And I will tell you the … We are committing to the you, we’re committing to the people of our country like few administrations, few people, few professionals have ever committed before they are. They are working so hard. I see them, I see them before my eyes exhausted. People that I’m dealing with every day exhausted. They haven’t left their offices, they haven’t left their hospitals. We meet with them. We see them and tremendous strides have been made. I think the vaccines, we’ll have a report on that, but the vaccines working together with other countries. We’re also working with other countries, many other countries and we all want everyone else to be first. We’re very happy, but we are very far down the line on vaccines. We’ll see how that all works. Johnson and Johnson’s doing a great job. Working very hard. The vaccine would be great therapy. A therapy in therapeutics would be great. We’ll see what happens. In the meantime, you may listen to what I said about the two drugs mentioned."
2020-04-05,19:44,Donald Trump,"My administration is rapidly implementing the largest emergency economic relief package in American history. You’ve seen what’s been happening. Billions of dollars in small business loans have already been processed through Paycheck Protection Program. So we went out on Friday and literally it’s become so popular. It’s been worked with the banks, they get it to the small business and it’s all about employment. It’s all about jobs. Want you to keep your jobs, give small business funding to keep the workers on the payroll. And we’re sending direct cash payments to millions of Americans and rushing aid to the hardest hit industries. We’re saving industries. We will be, you’ll be seeing it and if we do more, we’re going to do more and we’re going to try and get directly to people that are hit so hard. But we’re going to take care of our workers. We’re going to take care of our citizens. We’re going to take care of our small businesses. We’re going to take care of our larger businesses, the airplane industry, the airline industry. Lots of great industries that we have that are in trouble because of what took place over the last short period of time. These are industries that were doing better, for the most part, doing better than ever. The airlines were doing great."
2020-04-05,21:05,Donald Trump,"Oil, was doing great oil and gas and the energy industry was doing phenomenally well and got hit like nobody’s ever been hit before. Just about like no industry’s ever been hit before. There’s never been anything like this, but we see light at the end of the tunnel. Things are happening, things are happening. We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel and hopefully in the not too distant future, we’ll be very proud of the job we all did. Can never be happy when so many people are dying, but we’re going to be very proud of the job we did to keep the death down to an absolute minimum. The least TT could have happened with this terrible, terrible virus."
2020-04-05,21:52,Donald Trump,"In closing, I also want to note today is Palm Sunday and at the beginning of Holy Week for Christians in America and all around the world. While we may be apart from-"
2020-04-05,22:03,Donald Trump,"… all around the world. While we may be apart from one another, as you can see from our great churches, our great pastors and ministers are out there working very hard, but we may be apart we can use this time to turn to reflection and prayer and our own personal relationship with God. I would ask that all Americans pray for the heroic doctors and nurses, for the truck drivers and grocery store workers, and for everyone fighting this battle. I had mentioned yesterday where I see the nurses rushing into hospitals and they’re putting on their outfits and they’re putting on their masks and goggles in some cases, they’re rushing into war. They’re rushing into war, and I see people from apartment houses screaming and shouting and singing their praises. It’s an incredible thing. They’re warriors these doctors and nurses. They’re running into buildings and they’re literally putting it on as the doors are opening, they’re putting all this stuff and running inside and they’re running inside to tremendous danger. Tremendous danger."
2020-04-05,23:11,Donald Trump,"But most of all, I’d like to ask for your prayers for the families who have lost loved ones, ask God to comfort them in their hour of grief. It’s a great hour of grief for our nation, for the world. This morning I was talking to 151. For four days, I said 151. 151 countries. This morning it’s 182 countries. It jumped up a lot. So as of this morning, it’s 182 countries are under attack from this monster."
2020-04-05,23:55,Donald Trump,"With the faith of our families and the spirit of our people and the grace of our God, we will endure, we will overcome, we will prevail. We have learned so much. We will be stronger than ever and I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank the incredible professionals on the task force also. We had a big meeting today. Were calls all day long to so many different people and I think our package to get everyone working when we’re ready is really turning out to be successful. We may have to make it larger because it’s been really successful, but all of that comes back to this country. We want to get them back. We want to get our people back to work. Everybody wants to be back. We want to open up our country as soon as possible."
2020-04-05,24:40,Donald Trump,"So with that, I’m going to ask Dr. Birx to say a few words and she’s got some charts to show you and thank you very much. Thank you."
2020-04-05,24:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. President. As you can see from the hopeful signs in Italy and Spain where we see finally new cases and deaths declining, it’s giving us hope of what our future could be. We wanted to give you an update on where all of the states were. We’re looking at this is states normalized per 100,000 citizens. It looks very similar to last week. We wanted to update you. We’ve been covering throughout the week the states that were moving on this map. You can see very clearly where New York is as a state, although this is very much still centered in the New York metro area. New Jersey is the orange line. The green line is Louisiana. That’s followed by Massachusetts and then Connecticut and Michigan are together in those lines towards the bottom, and then of course Washington, DC is now visible on this map, which was not visible before. The yellow line towards the bottom is Washington state. Next slide please. So this just summarize all of the states we’re tracking very closely at the county level. We’re tracing and tracking not only the epidemic at the state level but understanding what’s happening in county by county with new cases, and of course also the deaths. We’re also triangulating that with all of the laboratory data. And just to tell you how we’re kind of doing that. For New York, which you can see at the top, their serology is now about 36% positive. They were in the forties, so day over day their percent positive is finally starting to decline. New Jersey’s is increasing, however. They’re now up to 42% of the specimens that come to the laboratory are positive. Louisiana 25%, Massachusetts 20%, Connecticut and Michigan 20%, District of Columbia 15%, Washington 8%, and then Illinois, Colorado are at about 16%. Pennsylvania, which is also new to the graphic, is at about 12%."
2020-04-05,27:11,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide please. So if we could go back one. I’m sorry, go back one slide, one more. All of the states here, those are 38 of the states, 38 of our states have less than 50 cases per hundred thousand. They are testing. Their laboratory results are consistent with that. Their seropositivity rate for their laboratories are less than 5%. So, this is how we’re tracking and triangulating both case reporting, mortality or fatalities, and also triangulating that with the laboratory. The New York metro area, New Jersey, Louisiana, and a series, and Washington state have all tested at a rate greater than Italy and Spain. I know many of you were tracking that. Remember, many of us we pushed out a lot of those assays at the beginning over the last two to three weeks and I want to just thank Admiral Giroir and HHS. He’s been working very closely to make sure that the states that were having an outbreak had access to all of their assays."
2020-04-05,28:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide, please. And then next one. So just to give you an idea of how we’re looking at this, we look at cases every day. I want to just thank my data team. They spend all evening compiling data. I get it about two o’clock in the morning and it looks at all of these metro areas by their granular counties so we can see the counties that have new cases. That also helps us identify the hospitals and understand what hospitals will need ventilators or PPE. So this is the Detroit area. It’s Oakland and Detroit. Wayne County."
2020-04-05,28:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide. We also then also track mortality. It gives us insight into how many clients are in the ICU, need care. We want to make sure that we’re meeting the needs both on cases and really appreciating the frontline healthcare workers that are really saving many people’s lives."
2020-04-05,29:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide. This just gives you an idea from New Orleans. We are now also tracking St. John the Baptist Parish also, but this would be New Orleans and Jefferson County and really tracking those on a case-by-case basis to look for changes over time. Next slide is their mortality and you can see it’s starting to stabilize."
2020-04-05,29:33,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, this is how we’ve been tracking and tracing the epidemic as it moves through states and counties and communities. As we started, we just wanted to note again we do see hopeful signs in Spain and Italy. They have completed nearly four weeks of mitigation with people really doing social distancing, staying at home, ensuring they were washing their hands. If they have to go out to the grocery store, they’re extraordinarily careful, they send one person from the family. And so we can really see that beginning to work and we’re very hopeful that over the next week, although we’ll see rising number of cases of people who lose their lives to this illness, we are also hopeful to see a stabilization of cases across these large metro areas where the outbreak began several weeks ago. So thank you for your attention."
2020-04-05,30:23,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Admiral, please."
2020-04-05,30:29,John Polowczyk,"Thank you, sir. What I thought I would do is update on the Airbridge first and then follow up on Dr. Birx and how we’re geographically aligning the supply chain. So the Airbridge we had three additional flights come in today bringing a million gowns, 2.8 million N95 masks, 2.8 million surgical masks, 11.8 million gloves, 18.6 thousand gowns on three flights, and that material will be pushed out across the nation, delivered to hospitals, nursing homes across the country."
2020-04-05,31:22,John Polowczyk,"Dr. Birx went through the geography, and so over the last few days I’ve been aligning the supply chain to those areas and then reaching down into those areas and extracting data from those areas on PPE burn rates. For example, I spent the weekend talking to the Chief Operating Officer of Detroit, Hakim Berry, for example, then talked to the leadership at Detroit Medical Center, Audrey Gregory, talked to the health officer in Oakland County, Michigan, and then also with the Chicago Health Officer, Dr. Allison Arwady, so reaching down to a level to understand their needs."
2020-04-05,32:14,John Polowczyk,"So we’re geographically aligning the supply chain. You can see Dr. Birx went through these counties and we’re getting down to the county level and then aligning it by priorities of point of care; public hospitals first, VA hospitals, private hospitals, nursing homes, first responders, acute care. Over the coming days, we will be making a push to the geographic areas that Dr. Birx mentioned, increasing the volume through the supply chain to those areas to give them weeks, not just days worth of supply. Primarily using our industry partners that we are directing; Cardinal, McKesson, Medline, Owen Minor, Henry Schein, Concordance Healthcare, directing them to put product to the hospital door, the nursing home door, the first responders, directly to them."
2020-04-05,33:21,John Polowczyk,"We’re also going to be working to push out millions of doses of hydroxychloride. We are working the distribution there to push the same thing to the same impacted areas, working it to get into hospitals and to every pharmacy, and so my team is back there right now working the arrangements to make that to the hospital front door and primarily to the local pharmacies so a doctor can write those prescriptions and you can get it prior to having to go to a home."
2020-04-05,33:57,Donald Trump,"You did a great job. Thank you very much, Admiral. Mike, please."
2020-04-05,33:58,Mike Pence,"Robert Wilkie, Mr. President."
2020-04-05,34:01,Robert Wilkie,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-05,34:03,Mike Pence,I knew you didn’t see him.
2020-04-05,34:04,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. My last appearance here, I mentioned that the President had given the Department of Veterans Affairs very specific instructions to be as aggressive as possible in response to the virus crisis and not only to protect veterans but also to help the American people. As many of you know, we have three primary missions at VA. One is support veterans health, the other is to provide veterans with benefits, and the third is memorial services. But we have a fourth mission and that is to support the nation in times of national emergency, both in war and in peace. We provide a bridge from the federal government to the states and localities during these emergencies. As a result of that, I have ordered our veterans hospitals to begin preparing more than 1500 beds to make them available both at the ICU and the acute care level to the states and localities across the country. As a result of that, we have opened up approximately 100 beds in the metropolitan New York area, in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and East Orange, New Jersey."
2020-04-05,35:20,Donald Trump,"We will be informing the Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, tomorrow that we will give him access to our VA Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana to come to the aid of the people of The Pelican State. I’ve also given instructions to initiate the fourth mission in Michigan. We will be providing the people of Michigan access to hospital beds in both Ann Arbor and in Detroit. We’ve also provided a pharmaceutical trailer to be used by the governor of Michigan at Cobo Hall to support the citizens of Michigan who will be coming into that facility for medical care. We have also informed the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that we will be helping them in their efforts to protect their most vulnerable citizens and two of their nursing homes."
2020-04-05,36:10,Donald Trump,"So in accord with the President’s instructions, the 400,000 men and women of the Department of Veterans Affairs are in this fight. We are in the fight not only for the nine and a half million veterans who are part of our service, but we are in the fight for the people of the United States. Thank you, Robert."
2020-04-05,36:32,Robert Wilkie,"Thank you, sir."
2020-04-05,36:32,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-04-05,36:33,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. You all have just heard from several members of the President’s White House Coronavirus Task Force and we are truly blessed to have the kind of leadership that we have and whether it’d Admiral Polowczyk who is organizing the distribution of tens of millions of supplies, whether it’d be Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci who are analyzing the data literally hour by hour, or whether it’d be that whole of government approach that you stood up, Mr. President, calling on every agency of government, including the VA, HHS and every agency. I hope the American people know at this President’s direction we are sparing no expense. We are doing whatever it takes. We’re marshaling the full resources of the federal government to respond to the challenges facing communities impacted today by the coronavirus and making sure every community in America has his support."
2020-04-05,37:37,Mike Pence,"We’ve also, as the President said so many times, we’ve forged a seamless partnership with states around the country. As the President just reflected, by this Tuesday with another 840 military medical personnel arriving in New York City they’ll be some 3000 Department of Defense and HHS personnel on the ground to supplement and to provide relief to healthcare workers really at the epicenter of the coronavirus in the New York city area. And you just heard the VA is opening up bed space."
2020-04-05,38:08,Mike Pence,"In New Jersey, I spoke at the President’s urging today with Governor Murphy. 500 ventilators announced today being built on the supplies that we have already provided. We were able to coordinate with him to extend all federal coordination on testing in New Jersey through May the 30th if the need is there and also opening up VA beds. I spoke with Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana and was encouraged to hear from him that, as you heard Dr. Birx say, that new cases were down slightly. In fact, we’re seeing a trend of some leveling among all the governors I spoke to today. I know what the Secretary of the VA just announced about opening up VA facilities has been a priority for Governor Edwards, but I assured him we’re going to continue to send resources and supplies and personnel to support their health care."
2020-04-05,39:08,Mike Pence,"In Michigan today, I spoke to both Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Mayor Mike Duggan of the City of Detroit. Governor Whitmer and I spoke about a new program in Detroit that will make hydrochloroquine available for 3000 patients through the Henry Ford Hospital. They’ll be tracking in a formal study the results of that. At the President’s urging, I assured her that we’re more than prepared to make hydrochloroquine broadly available to pharmacies and doctor’s offices across the Detroit area as they deem appropriate."
2020-04-05,39:50,Mike Pence,"I also heard from Mayor Mike Duggan, as I told you, Mr. President, and he was so grateful to the FDA, not only for approving the Henry Ford Hospital tests that will be exploring hydrochloroquine, but also for the rapid approval of the 15-minute test. In fact, Mayor Duggan told me that he was able to use the 15-minute test this weekend to test 150 first responders who had been sidelined because they’d been exposed to the coronavirus. They all got the 15-minute test. They’re all back in the line of duty and the mayor couldn’t have been more grateful."
2020-04-05,40:27,Mike Pence,"In Illinois, I spoke with Governor J. B. Pritzker as well as Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago. As you just heard, not only have we sent 600 ventilators to the state of Illinois but I assured the governor, I assured the mayor that while the principle focus that we have in the next several days is on the rising cases in the greater New York City area and Louisiana, that Michigan and Illinois are in the forefront of our thinking and at the President’s direction we’re going to make sure the people of Illinois, people of Michigan have the resources, equipment, and support that they need. The governor did express great appreciation for the fact that our Army Corps of Engineer had constructed 500 beds at McCormick Place and before the end of this week would construct another 2500 beds for an overflow healthcare facility in Chicago. In fact, Mr. President, Mayor Lightfoot told me that the Army Corps was just outstanding in the job that they had been doing in constructing that extra bed space."
2020-04-05,41:35,Mike Pence,"As I close, let me just express as the President did our profound appreciation for Governor Kate Brown and Governor Jay Inslee. The state of Oregon and the state of Washington are leading by example. Oregon sent 140 ventilators to New York City. They looked at their circumstances and concluded that they could spare those at the point of the need, and because of the low and steady numbers in Washington state and in California Governor Inslee today announced that they were sending 400 ventilators back to the Strategic National Stockpile and those will be deployed at the point of the need."
2020-04-05,42:18,Mike Pence,"Not only are California and Washington state low and steady, but frankly, as I talked to governors and mayors today, I want to say to the American people that we are beginning to see the glimmers of progress. The experts will tell me not to jump to any conclusions, and I’m not, but like your President I’m an optimistic person and I’m hopeful, and the truth is we’re starting to see cases and most importantly losses and hospitalizations begin to stabilize. But make no mistake about it, I want to say to the American people if that holds, if that’s happening, it’s because of what all of you are doing. It’s because the American people are putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America. You’re listening to your state and local officials. You’re practicing social distancing. You’re using drive-thrus instead of going into restaurants."
2020-04-05,43:18,Mike Pence,"So, on behalf of your President and all of us working really at every level, I just want to say thank you America. Thank you for responding. Thank you for putting other people’s lives in the forefront of your thinking, putting it again over and above your own inconvenience and difficulty. Because of your efforts there is, as the President just said, light at the end of the tunnel, and I’m absolutely convinced with the continued cooperation, patience, persistence, and prayers of the American people we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this a lot sooner than we first thought it would take. Thank you."
2020-04-05,43:55,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike, very much. Thank you."
2020-04-05,43:59,Unnamed,Mr. President.
2020-04-05,43:59,Unnamed,Mr. President.
2020-04-05,43:59,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-05,44:00,Unnamed,"Mr. President, if we could start with the admiral if that’s all right for you, sir. I wanted to ask you about the air gap flight, sir."
2020-04-05,44:03,Unnamed,"Can we start with the Admiral if that’s all right please, sir? I wanted to asked you about the AirCat flight, sir. The two flights that came through, the three flights, where did they come from, sir?"
2020-04-05,44:08,Admiral,They came from Asia.
2020-04-05,44:09,Unnamed,"Asia. Okay. Then you were mentioning all these supplies that you dropped off, the masks, the gowns, the hydrochloroquine. How are you guys making sure that there’s not a run on these products? You drop them off at Hospital A and that people just don’t rush and go grab every mask, gown. Then I have a question for you sir, after that."
2020-04-05,44:24,Admiral,"So it’s going to the loading dock, and there’s an invoice. So those people that are responsible for that loading dock and that invoice, they’re going to make sure that there’s not going to be a run on the bank."
2020-04-05,44:39,Unnamed,You’re not worried about a run on any of the supplies.
2020-04-05,44:39,Admiral,No.
2020-04-05,44:40,Unnamed,"Okay. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. Mr. President, first, did you have a chance-"
2020-04-05,44:44,Donald Trump,"We do get orders for a lot more than sometimes we think an area needs. Generally speaking, we like to either negotiate that down or give it to them as they want. So we’ve had a lot of orders that we think are high, but we generally, if we have it, for instance, with the medicines and with other things, we like to give it to them. Every day we’re building up and building it up very rapidly and deploying it. But we do get orders from some of the states where we don’t think they need it. We try and get it for them what they want anyway. Okay, go ahead."
2020-04-05,45:17,Unnamed,"You mentioned the Prime Minister off the top. Have you had a chance to speak to him today, sir?"
2020-04-05,45:20,Donald Trump,"I didn’t speak to him, no. I did get a call from the ambassador. Hey, it’s a big move going to the hospital. That’s a big thing. He’s a great gentleman. So I just hope he’s okay."
2020-04-05,45:35,Unnamed,"Then also, you mentioned the nurses, the doctors, dealing with [crosstalk 00:45:39]. I’m sorry, the people that are gearing up and getting ready and people that are applauding and celebrating them. Has there been any talk on any level whatsoever of some sort of either compensation fund or protection for nurses, doctors? Because there’s been a lot of fear. There’s been some people that said, I can’t risk my family’s livelihood. I can’t go back to the ER. Has there been any discussion?"
2020-04-05,45:57,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re talking about it, and we’re talking about doing something for them, but we’re really looking at the conclusion. We don’t want to focus on that now. They’re incredible. They’re not saying, we’re not doing it. They go in with good equipment, with great equipment and with stuff that’s not so good. Sometimes they catch it wearing the best stuff you can buy, brand new, the best stuff. This is a very tough enemy, but these are amazing people. No, we are talking about something, but we’re really thinking about let’s get it finished first before we do that. Please."
2020-04-05,46:30,Unnamed,"The Surgeon General this morning was talking about the coming week being among the hardest and saddest weeks of our lives. He was talking about this being our Pearl Harbor, our 9/11 moment. You all are talking about glimmers of hope and stabilization. How are the American people supposed to bridge those different descriptions that they’re getting from this administration?"
2020-04-05,46:51,Donald Trump,"I don’t think they’re so different. I think we all know that we have to reach a certain point, and that point is going to be a horrific point in terms of death. But it’s also a point at which things are going to start changing. We’re getting very close to that level right now, and the next week-and-a=half, two weeks are going to be, I think they’re going to be very difficult."
2020-04-05,47:12,Donald Trump,"At the same time, we understand what they represent and what that time represents. Hopefully we can get this over with because this is a very horrible thing for the world. Look, we’re one country out of 182 now that have, 182 countries. I have a friend of mine, he said didn’t know we had so many countries in the world. 182 countries are now affected by this. So we want to get it over with. Okay? Please."
2020-04-05,47:42,Unnamed,"On those numbers, sir, could I just ask one follow-up on those numbers-"
2020-04-05,47:42,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-04-05,47:42,Unnamed,"… that you were talking about earlier? How does that change the projections that you were making earlier this week of 100,000 to 240,000?"
2020-04-05,47:49,Donald Trump,"Well, we hope we can stay under those numbers. Those are numbers of death, and we hope we can stay under those numbers. That would be terrific and as far under those numbers as possible. Now, if we did nothing, you know that number too. But the American people really stepped up. So did the professionals. They just really stepped up. So we’re hoping to stay under those numbers, and that means the minimum and the maximum, but we’re hoping to stay under the minimum number. You know what that number was."
2020-04-05,48:19,Unnamed,"Right. But the numbers that you were talking about today, have they changed those projections?"
2020-04-05,48:24,Donald Trump,"I would say the answer is yes, but I would also say that we’re not going to know really in terms of a final toll until we get out to the end, and we’re probably possibly not so far away. We’re getting closer, but it’s our goal to stay as far under that minimum number, the minimum number, as possible. Okay? That’s what we want to do. Go ahead."
2020-04-05,48:48,Unnamed,"Mr. President, as president of the United States, your words carry enormous weight in this country and around the world. While you acknowledge you’re not a physician, you do promote these medicines extensively here. How do you not go so far as to be giving medical advice? You said yesterday you might take some of these medicines even though you don’t have symptoms. Are you still planning to do that, and how do you calibrate being enthusiastic and not playing doctor?"
2020-04-05,49:15,Donald Trump,"Because I want people to live, and I’m seeing people dying. I’ve seen people that are going to die without it. You know the expression when that’s happening, they should do it. What really do we have to lose? We also have, this medicine has been tested for many years for malaria and for lupus. So it’s been out there. So it’s a very strong, powerful medicine, but it doesn’t kill people. We have some very good results and some very good tests. You’ve seen the same tests that I have."
2020-04-05,49:47,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:05:48].
2020-04-05,49:48,Donald Trump,"In France, they had a very good test. They’re continuing. But we don’t have time to go and say, gee, let’s take a couple of years and test it out, and let’s go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories. We don’t have time. I’d love to do that, but we have people dying today. As we speak, there are people dying. If it works, that’d be great. If it doesn’t work, we know for many years malaria, it’s incredible what it’s done for malaria. It’s incredible what it’s done for lupus, but it doesn’t kill people."
2020-04-05,50:19,Donald Trump,"That’s one of the things with the vaccine. When we have a vaccine, we have to do tests because when you inject that vaccine, when they take whatever it is they have to take, we have to make sure it doesn’t have a horrible impact, destroy somebody. It could. So we have to test it for long period of time. This one, not so much because it’s been out there."
2020-04-05,50:42,Donald Trump,"Now, I’m not acting as a doctor. I’m saying do what you want, but there are some good signs. You’ve read the signs. I’ve read the signs. With the other one, there are some very good signs also. Going together works very well. But there may be an indication that if you have a problem with your heart, you shouldn’t take what we call the Z-Pak. You shouldn’t take it, and that’s okay."
2020-04-05,51:08,Donald Trump,"But I would love to go to a laboratory and spend a couple of years testing something. We don’t have time. We don’t have two hours because there are people dying right now. If it does help, great. If it doesn’t help, we gave it a shot. We gave it a shot. That’s the way I feel."
2020-04-05,51:27,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:51:28].
2020-04-05,51:28,Donald Trump,"We passed something. Yeah, I would be very serious about taking it. We passed something that I’m very proud of. It’s called Right to Try. For 45, 50 years they’ve been trying. It makes so much sense. We have the greatest doctors and labs and lab technicians, the greatest medicines, the greatest minds in the world. Everybody admits it. When we’re close to having something or when we have something that tests incredibly well, you couldn’t use it for years because they would take years and years to test. So with the help of also Democrats, I got it bipartisan, but they’ve been trying to get this passed for decades. You know that. It’s called Right to Try. So a person would be diagnosed terminally ill from something. In the old days, meaning before a year ago, they would say, do you think I could try this pill, this whatever, this medicine that’s testing so well? No, you can’t do that. You can’t do that. Under no circumstances. They’d leave for Asia, they’d leave for Europe, if they had money. If they had no money, they’d go home and die with no hope."
2020-04-05,52:40,Donald Trump,"We’ve got a thing called Right to Try. If somebody’s very ill, terminally ill, they’re going to die. It was very complex. It wasn’t as easy as it sounds because there were huge liability problems. The drug companies didn’t want to do it because they didn’t want it on test results because these are very sick people. So they didn’t want to bring down their test results. The insurance companies had tremendous problems."
2020-04-05,53:05,Donald Trump,"I got everybody in the room. I said, “Look, we’ll sign a waiver. The person taking it will say, we’re not going to sue. The family’s not going to sue the drug company, not going to sue the insurance company, not going to sue the state, the city or the federal government.” Okay? It’s called exculpation, and we got it done. It’s a very simple agreement. I don’t know why nobody ever thought of it, but they never thought of it. I did, and we got it done. Now, we have Right to Try, which is actually, in my opinion, much more difficult than what we’re talking about here. But if there’s a medicine or something, a possible cure or something that’s looking good and somebody has something they’re going to die or they’re very sick, they take it. We’ve had some unbelievable results, unbelievable results, and it also gives the people hope. Yes, please."
2020-04-05,53:55,Unnamed,"Mr. President, the doctors who are treating coronavirus patients, they have the medical expertise to determine whether or not they should prescribe hydroxychloroquine."
2020-04-05,54:03,Donald Trump,And many of them do.
2020-04-05,54:04,Unnamed,And there are already clinical trials in place looking at hydroxychloroquine.
2020-04-05,54:08,Donald Trump,Sure. They should be finished in about a year.
2020-04-05,54:10,Unnamed,So why not just let the science speak for itself? Why are you promoting this drug?
2020-04-05,54:16,Donald Trump,I’m not. I’m not.
2020-04-05,54:16,Unnamed,You come at me-
2020-04-05,54:17,Donald Trump,"Very simply, I’m not at all. I’m not. Look, you know what I’m trying to do. I’m trying to save lives."
2020-04-05,54:22,Unnamed,"You come out here every day, right, sir? Talking about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine."
2020-04-05,54:24,Donald Trump,"I want them to try it. It may work, and it may not work. But if it doesn’t work, it’s nothing lost by doing it. Nothing. Because we know long-term what I want. I want to save lives, and I don’t want it to be in a lab for the next year-and-a-half as people are dying all over the place."
2020-04-05,54:40,Unnamed,"It’s already out there. Doctors are already able to prescribe it off label, right?"
2020-04-05,54:43,Donald Trump,That’s right.
2020-04-05,54:43,Unnamed,So what did you accomplish?
2020-04-05,54:44,Donald Trump,"Well, I’ll tell you what I accomplished. We bought massive amounts of it, 29 million doses of it. We have it coming from all of the labs who are actually now doing it here because in case it does work, we want to have it. We’ve given it to drug stores. We’re sending it all over. FEMA is doing it. FEMA is doing it. We’re doing it through different channels, many different channels, including the companies that make it. It’s a very special thing."
2020-04-05,55:12,Donald Trump,"Now, it may not work, in which case, hey, it didn’t work. It may work, in which case it’s going to save a lot of lives. Now, a lot of people say, if the people walking in prior to getting it, if they take it, it has a profound effect. Well, maybe it does and maybe it doesn’t. [crosstalk 00:55:30] I don’t want to wait a year-and-a-half to find out. Only CNN would ask that question. Fake news. Go ahead. Bunch of fakers."
2020-04-05,55:38,Unnamed,"Sir, I have one question on oil, but first I was hoping to ask Dr. Birx a question. The president just said that based on the most recent data that you’ve seen some change in the projection. I’m wondering if you could … You obviously have a week’s more worth of data since the sort of 100,000 to 240,000 potential death figures that you gave us last week. So I’m wondering with all the caveats that this is sort of based on, continuing social distancing and that we might see if one city pops, things could change dramatically. What, are the sort of range that you’re now looking at in terms of total death impact?"
2020-04-05,56:22,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think the most important thing right now is when we were talking about why we are hopeful, we’re hopeful because last time I was here, I wasn’t able to really tell you that Italy and Spain were coming across their apex and coming down the other side. I think, to me, that’s extraordinarily hopeful. They just completed four weeks of really strong mitigation, and I think that’s our word to the American people is we can look like that. Two other countries look like that now, two other countries with a very similar experience to our experience with higher case numbers and higher mortality."
2020-04-05,57:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So that’s what the promise is. The promise is if we do this, we could potentially be better. Now, Dr. Fauci and I today got another update from another independent modeler, and the numbers came in close to that 100,000 number. Again, but we believe, Dr. Fauci and I, that if every American follows the guidelines, six feet, washing hands, not social gathering, that will have an even greater impact."
2020-04-05,57:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"On the other side of the equation certainly is are remarkable health care providers, our respiratory therapists, our laboratory technicians, our nurses and doctors. They’re saving lives every day, and so that changes the number too."
2020-04-05,57:49,Donald Trump,"I also think that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx are very impressed with the American people, and I’m not going to put words in anybody’s mouth. I would never do that, but I am, and I will say that they are doing maybe a better job than we all thought even possible. When you look at streets in New York where there’s nobody in the street, no cars, no nothing. I see it. I’ve seen those streets for a long time, and they’re packed all the time. Now you see there’s nobody."
2020-04-05,58:18,Donald Trump,"You look at other places. You look at what’s going on in California where they’re doing a fantastic job. They really are. The governor’s doing great. I’m proud of them. I’m proud of a lot of people. I’m proud of a lot of people on the other side, a lot of people. I’m really delighted to work with people that, frankly on other issues, I didn’t get along so well with. We disagree on this or that. We don’t have to go into that now, but we’re getting along with a lot of people, and they’re happy with us. We’re happy with them."
2020-04-05,58:53,Donald Trump,"But I really believe that the American people are doing a better job than anybody would have thought even possible. That’s one of the reasons we can even be talking about the kind of number that we hopefully will be talking about, which is at the minimum level instead of the maximum or beyond. It’s not even the maximum. It’s much beyond the maximum level, which would be horrific. Yeah, please."
2020-04-05,59:15,Unnamed,"Mr. President, Secretary Esper mentioned the Department of Defense might be moving in the direction of using face coverings. Former Vice-President Biden had mentioned that he was going to be using a mask whenever he goes out now. Are we getting to a point where we might see members of the Coronavirus Task Force also wear face coverings?"
2020-04-05,59:36,Donald Trump,"Well, it was voluntary as I saw it yesterday. Certainly if they’d want to, I would encourage it. I would have absolutely no problem with that if they wanted. We had a long meeting today. There’s good separation. But the task force meets, and I would certainly have absolutely no problem if they wanted to. I think frankly it’s something, at least for a period of time, where it might be advisable. It’s advisory, and we’ll see what happens. Yes, please."
2020-04-05,01:00:05,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. On Project Airbridge, we’ve seen reports that Chinese shipments of testing kits and PPE turn out to be faulty in some capacity. We obviously don’t have oversight-"
2020-04-05,01:00:16,Donald Trump,"Not here. No, not here."
2020-04-05,01:00:17,Unnamed,"No, but to Spain in particular."
2020-04-05,01:00:18,Donald Trump,"You’ve seen in Spain, and you’ve seen it different. They’re not sending faulty things to us."
2020-04-05,01:00:23,Unnamed,So you’re not concerned that any of the PPE-
2020-04-05,01:00:24,Donald Trump,No. We test it. We look at it. We check it out. Please.
2020-04-05,01:00:29,Admiral,"One of the things we’re doing to prevent that is using those six companies that are the ones in the major supply chain. We are actually going to facilities looking at product, inspecting it and clearing it before it comes here. So we’ve heard those things. That’s why we’re doing that."
2020-04-05,01:00:49,Unnamed,"Okay, thank you. A follow-up for the doctors, if possible."
2020-04-05,01:00:52,Donald Trump,"We’re also sending from other locations. And when it comes to the ventilators, which are very complex, we are now building, we have now under construction, literally thousands of ventilators. But so far I think our projections on ventilators have been right. They’ve been correct. Did you have something for who?"
2020-04-05,01:01:11,Admiral,"Well, for yourself and for Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, if they want to take a crack at it. Some of the models that you guys are using, the IHME model in particular has been very accurate when it comes to projecting deaths over the last couple of days. But there’s a couple of other metrics that they seem to be pretty far off on, specifically hospital beds. Are you guys happy with the models you’re currently using? Is there any need to adjust those?"
2020-04-05,01:01:36,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s turning out that we need less hospital beds. That’s what you’re talking about and that’s what we … Well, we may have models, but we’ve been sort of saying that. In New York we were saying, we think you’re going to need less. Now, let’s hope that continues, but right now I heard Governor Cuomo this morning, and he was saying less hospital beds, also less death. That was a very big thing. First time, less death today than yesterday. Right? That’s a big thing. But also less hospital beds. That means less patients because basically it’s less patients, and we were saying that. It also means less ventilators. So there’s a lot of very positive things happening. Okay, please."
2020-04-05,01:02:16,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. With Prime Minister Johnson hospitalized, I noticed a few minutes ago you were standing right next to Vice-President Pence. Are you considering staying away from each other just to make sure that we have continuity of government in the executive branch?"
2020-04-05,01:02:33,Donald Trump,"We have this tiny platform, and I’d love it to be wider. You’re staying away from each other. Mike, you were tested?"
2020-04-05,01:02:44,Mike Pence,"Yes, sir."
2020-04-05,01:02:44,Donald Trump,"Okay, like recently. So was I a couple of days ago."
2020-04-05,01:02:51,Unnamed,You keep interacting with groups of people.
2020-04-05,01:02:51,Donald Trump,"We are. We are who we are on this platform. But I get next to him, I don’t breathe. I’m only kidding. We are sometimes forced into positions that I’d rather be away, but you’re all looking for questions. Mike’s a very big part of this. I am. It’s very difficult maintaining this distance on this little area."
2020-04-05,01:03:19,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you quickly under what circumstances you would consider leveling tariffs on imports of oil to the United States?"
2020-04-05,01:03:28,Donald Trump,"Well, if the oil price stays the way it is. Because of people that really want to see it go up. When I say get, we want to save a great industry. We built a great industry in this country. If they don’t get along, I would do that. Yeah. I would do tariffs, very substantial tariffs, because we’re independent now. We have our own oil. If I did the tariffs, we essentially would be saying we don’t want foreign oil. We don’t want any foreign oil. We’re just going to use our oil, and that would help to save an industry, and it’s become a tremendous job producer, and it’s great to be independent. We’re independent. Our energy is now independent. We produce more oil and gas than anybody else, than any other country, and that all took place over a very recent time."
2020-04-05,01:04:16,Donald Trump,"Now, in the meantime, I’m seeing 91 cents a gallon out on the road. Okay? There’s a lot of people are happy. I see very inexpensive jet fuel. We’re trying to save the airline industry. But I want to save our great energy industry, and that’s what we’re doing. Yeah. So I would absolutely do that. What we’ll do, the price will still be very low. But what we’ll do is we’ll save, and very importantly, we’ll save tens of thousands of jobs."
2020-04-05,01:04:47,Donald Trump,"One of the other things we’re doing is having oil shipped to our strategic oil reserves. Okay? We’re buying it for the right price, and we’re shipping it. In some cases we’re storing it for nothing. They’re there. We’re filling up our reserves with this very inexpensive oil. Nobody thought they’d ever see a price. This is like from the 1950s where they had big dollars. Okay?"
2020-04-05,01:05:11,Donald Trump,"So no, I would use tariffs if I had to. I don’t think I’m going to have to, because Russia doesn’t benefit by having this, and Saudi Arabia doesn’t benefit by having oil and gas. So they are major sources of income. So it’s obviously very bad for them. But we have an industry that’s a very important industry, and it’s really formed beautifully. It was the virus that killed it because what happened is it’s down 40% from the day this happened, 40%. Otherwise it would be doing phenomenally well. So that’s it. Yeah."
2020-04-05,01:05:46,Unnamed,"Mr. President, can we get an idea of timeline for those people that are waiting for the stimulus checks? How many more days they may have to wait. Speaker Pelosi, today, or I think last night, said in the next bill that they would like to see additional stimulus checks made. Have you guys thrown around and amount of how much money-"
2020-04-05,01:06:01,Donald Trump,"No, but I like the concept of it. I think it’s good."
2020-04-05,01:06:03,Unnamed,Are you guys throwing around an amount of how much money?
2020-04-05,01:06:03,Donald Trump,"No, but I like the concept of it. I think it’s good. We’re talking about a different way of doing it. But I like the concept. I like the concept of infrastructure. Our country has to be rebuilt. They spent all this money in the Middle East, $8 trillion. We’re up to now $8 trillion in the Middle East. We got to rebuild our country, okay. We have to rebuild our roads and our schools, our bridges. We have to rebuild our country."
2020-04-05,01:06:24,Donald Trump,"So I like an infrastructure bill. I also like money going directly to people. It’s not their fault that this happened. And I do think this, especially the faster we can get it open, our country. Can you believe we’re talking about our country? Getting our country open. The faster we get it open, the bigger the boom, the bigger the rocket ship going up."
2020-04-05,01:06:44,Donald Trump,"I think it has a chance to go really quickly, relatively quickly. I’d like to see very quickly, but we’ll see. But part of the stimulus and part of what we’re doing, that will help it. And the nice part is, we’re paying practically zero interest rates. We’re paying very little. It’s one of the reasons I like the infrastructure bill, because we’re borrowing. We have a strong dollar, and the advantage to a strong dollar is everybody wants to invest in this country. They all want to buy our dollar."
2020-04-05,01:07:13,Unnamed,"On the direct payment, sir, just in terms of timeline, are we talking still two weeks? Are we talking 10 days?"
2020-04-05,01:07:18,Donald Trump,"I think so. Yeah, from what I’m hearing, yeah, a couple of weeks. That’s what I’m hearing. Yeah. Please."
2020-04-05,01:07:21,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. I wanted to do a follow up on the hydroxy question. Thanks for the numbers. Has there been any tension with the medical staff on that? Are they in agreement with [crosstalk 01:07:30]?"
2020-04-05,01:07:31,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we discussed it with the staff. We discussed it with FDA. FDA approved it, so… Which is another point. I mean, it’s been approved by FDA, which is very important. If it wasn’t an approved by FDA, then I couldn’t do this. But FDA’s approved it, the hydroxy."
2020-04-05,01:07:46,Unnamed,"And also, if this turns out not to work, are hospitals and doctors going to be exculpatory from the federal government under the Right to Try?"
2020-04-05,01:07:56,Donald Trump,"Well, we’ll see if it works. No, it’s not going to hurt people. It can help them, but it’s not going to hurt them. That’s the beauty of it. You see? It can help them, but it’s not going to hurt them. What do you have to lose? Okay. Question you had in the back, please."
2020-04-05,01:08:10,Unnamed,"Obviously we know anyone can spread the disease, right? Unwittingly."
2020-04-05,01:08:13,Donald Trump,Right.
2020-04-05,01:08:14,Unnamed,"So why even have a few businesses open? Why not just shut everything down? There are grocery store that are open, fast food places. Why even take a little chance? Just shut them all down [crosstalk 01:08:21] temporarily."
2020-04-05,01:08:21,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to have to, we’ll answer that question later. All I can say is that right now, things are looking really good and opening up with a bang will be a great thing and there’s nobody going to be happier than me. Please go ahead."
2020-04-05,01:08:33,Unnamed,"Just to follow up on your comments about the ventilators. The IHME Model suggests that 32,000 ventilators will be required in mid April. GM is not expected to have ventilators ready before-"
2020-04-05,01:08:46,Donald Trump,"32,000 will be what?"
2020-04-05,01:08:47,Unnamed,Required across the country.
2020-04-05,01:08:51,Donald Trump,In addition to the ones that we’ve already sent?
2020-04-05,01:08:53,Unnamed,Just in-
2020-04-05,01:08:54,Donald Trump,"Don’t forget, we have almost 10,000, a little more than 9,000 right now. And those are ready to rock should we need them. And we had to keep it. You understand that flexibility. So that if we need them in New York, which we might not. If we need them. But they’re ready to move. We’re already, military. It’s a military operation. We are ready to move. They’ll be moved immediately into whatever section of the country we need. Would you like to answer that, by the way?"
2020-04-05,01:09:18,John Polowczyk,"Yes sir. So, correct. FEMA is working on a plan to be able to move ventilators. So for example, DOD gave another 500 ventilators. They’re on the move, being staged at Fort Dix to be able to rapidly deploy them to locations. To include, you heard the president mentioned States giving to States. Things like that. So that there’s the ventilators that aren’t in use that conceivably we could rapidly move as well."
2020-04-05,01:09:49,Unnamed,Right. But you mentioned that there were thousands that are currently being made.
2020-04-05,01:09:53,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-04-05,01:09:54,Unnamed,So I just wondered if there was any update with GM and Ford just being [crosstalk 01:09:57].
2020-04-05,01:09:57,Donald Trump,"No, but they’re not going to be long. They’ve started. GM, Ford. We have many, we have 11 companies, approximately 11 companies building them, and we’re going to have a stockpile for future. Hopefully we never have to use them. They should’ve, the hospitals, the States, should’ve bought a stockpile. They didn’t do that. So we’ve made up for it. But if we have extras, other countries need them. I mean, you see UK needs them badly. France needs them badly. Italy needs them badly. They need them. So it’s complicated. It’s a big piece of equipment. It’s expensive. And we’ll be able to help other countries after we take care of our needs. Yes, please. Go ahead."
2020-04-05,01:10:38,Unnamed,"Yeah, thank you, sir. On infrastructure spending. As you remarked-"
2020-04-05,01:10:42,Donald Trump,"I actually chose you, but that’s okay."
2020-04-05,01:10:43,Unnamed,"Oh, I’m sorry."
2020-04-05,01:10:43,Donald Trump,Let him go. That’s alright. Go ahead.
2020-04-05,01:10:45,Unnamed,"On infrastructure, you’ve remarked about how empty the roads are. Is there any thought, is there any way to speed up infrastructure? I mean, the beltway in Washington, it takes forever to do any road repairs because of all the traffic."
2020-04-05,01:10:59,Donald Trump,"Oh, I know. Because they don’t do construction techniques that work and that are better. I mean, I see a highway, which is what I do. I do construction. What I did. I see a highway. That’s good, but it’s got a bad top. And it’s got a big base, concrete base underneath. And I’ll see them come, I don’t want to say where, but I could tell you, I could give you plenty of examples, and they rip the hell out of it. They take out the base. They take out everything. Now they pour a new base that isn’t as good, isn’t as deep, isn’t as thick. The concrete base was fantastic. The footing. It takes forever. [crosstalk 01:11:32] Wait a minute. It takes forever. And instead of scraping out the asphalt or whatever may be the top, scraping it off and putting the new asphalt down, putting the new median in, then they could have done it. And then they open the highway and it starts to crack. The reason is because it hasn’t been set. And they spend 10, 15, 20 times more money than they have to. I never believe, when I watch these people doing highways and doing roadways and doing work, how they take the most expensive solution. And the bottom line, the job itself is far worse."
2020-04-05,01:12:09,Unnamed,"That’s what I’m getting at is, taking advantage of the fact that so many people are staying at home, not on the roads. Is there a way to do it more cheaply and efficiently?"
2020-04-05,01:12:16,Donald Trump,"Well, yeah. Hopefully they’re not going to be staying at home for long. Hopefully this will be out and we’re not going to have that kind of time. If we have that kind of time, we made a big mistake. Please go ahead."
2020-04-05,01:12:25,Unnamed,Thank you Mr. President. How many rapid tests has the federal government already deployed across the country and which regions receive those tests?
2020-04-05,01:12:33,Donald Trump,Who has that information?
2020-04-05,01:12:34,Mike Pence,[inaudible 01:12:34] speak about that.
2020-04-05,01:12:35,Donald Trump,"You will? Go ahead, Mike."
2020-04-05,01:12:36,Mike Pence,"[inaudible 01:12:36] followup. The 15 minute test has really been a breakthrough. I’ve reflected on the progress that they’ve made in Detroit with first responders back on duty with the Abbott laboratories test. Abbott Laboratory started last Tuesday producing about 50,000 tests a day. And I’m informed that there are about 18,000 of these machines already all across the country. I mean they’re actually the same machines that you use to get a strep test quickly when you go to the doctor. But now Abbott is surging these new 15 minute coronavirus tests out to healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities around the country. In addition, as the president said, FEMA has purchased 1200 of these devices. We’re distributing them to all 50 States and the Indian Healthcare system. And then we’ll be distributing the tests. Dr. Birx, is there anything to add further on that?"
2020-04-05,01:13:38,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That’s perfect, sir."
2020-04-05,01:13:38,Mike Pence,"Okay, further?"
2020-04-05,01:13:38,Unnamed,So all of the States already received these tests?
2020-04-05,01:13:43,Mike Pence,Let me ask Admiral Polowczyk about the 1200 devices.
2020-04-05,01:13:45,John Polowczyk,I didn’t hear the question.
2020-04-05,01:13:46,Mike Pence,Have they received the 1200 or what’s the time table?
2020-04-05,01:13:51,John Polowczyk,I believe they’re on the shelf at Abbott. A good majority of them.
2020-04-05,01:13:54,Donald Trump,Tuesday they go out.
2020-04-05,01:13:56,John Polowczyk,"Right. Yes, sir. So I don’t have the exact numbers. I think there is some manufacturing in there, but-"
2020-04-05,01:14:01,Donald Trump,They go out on Tuesday.
2020-04-05,01:14:02,John Polowczyk,The large balance of them are on the shelf.
2020-04-05,01:14:04,Unnamed,Mr. President-
2020-04-05,01:14:05,Donald Trump,"Some have gone out by the way, but the bulk of them of go out on Tuesday. Yeah, please."
2020-04-05,01:14:09,Unnamed,"Sir, in some of these previous briefings, you’ve referred to the federal government as the backup. Today, there’s definitely a different approach here, I think."
2020-04-05,01:14:21,Donald Trump,No.
2020-04-05,01:14:21,Unnamed,"With the distribution. The sense of it, in listening to your presentation today, is that you are embracing taking a leader role for distribution. Is there a change?"
2020-04-05,01:14:33,Donald Trump,"No. There’s not a change, but we’re supposed to be the backup. But like in Illinois, the Governor couldn’t do his job, so we had to help him. We’re sending 600 ventilators. We’re building a hospital in McCormick Place. So we have some people that were not able to do. We have other people that needed a little help. In New York, we had to give a lot of help. But we worked very well with Governor Cuomo and with Mayor de Blasio. But no, we are meant to be the backup, but we’ve taken on a much bigger role than that. And that’s okay. I have no objection to it. Now in some cases, this works so well where they’re actually now seeing, they think they’re over the big problem. And they’re actually calling us and they’re saying, you can take your equipment back now. But we’re really deployed as a backup. But I feel we’re much more than that. They’ve done a much better job."
2020-04-05,01:15:25,Donald Trump,"I will say this. I don’t think that the people that have represented this country, the federal government, whether it’s the Admiral and the Generals and all of the people that we call to the fore, I just… They’re heroes for what they’ve done. What they’ve been able to do in a short period of time, they took a system that was broken. Just like we did the military. Our military was broken. Our military was depleted. It was broken. And we’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve rebuilt this whole system too. In a way, Kelly, I appreciate your question because you’re hearing all of the things that we’re, that the millions of masks, the hundreds of thousands of gowns. And they’re surgical. They’re their protective gowns. At the highest level. We’re getting it to the various States. And most of the governors are very happy."
2020-04-05,01:16:19,Donald Trump,"Now a lot of times it’s politics. Maybe I do the same thing, I don’t know. But they’ll try and act not so happy. I will tell you, when I speak to them or when Vice President speaks to them, they’re singing the praises of all of these people. So I always take umbrage when somebody says something about what we’ve done. Now to do this-"
2020-04-05,01:16:41,Unnamed,"Does the buck stop with you now, sir?"
2020-04-05,01:16:41,Donald Trump,To do this should have taken-
2020-04-05,01:16:42,Unnamed,Is that what has happened?
2020-04-05,01:16:42,Donald Trump,"To do what we’ve been able to do and to build it to a level should have taken a year, should have taken two years. They did it in a matter of weeks. And we’re helping States. It’s them. As an example, in New York had the right to buy 16,000 ventilators. They could’ve bought them. They didn’t. I understand why they didn’t. It was a very expensive purchase. Very expensive and that’s a lot, 16,000. And they chose to do something else with their money. I understand that. The problem is when something like this comes along, what you don’t expect. Look, 1917. That’s a long time ago. Perhaps 100 million people died. It’s a long time ago. So people don’t think it’s going to happen. I would have… Frankly, I mean, did anybody in this room think a thing like this could happen? But it happened."
2020-04-05,01:17:29,Donald Trump,"And we built up a force. This is a military operation, as it turned out, it really is. With FEMA, with the Army Corps of Engineers. I mean, Army Corps of Engineers. And you were very gracious on that point. The Army Corps of Engineers building 2,500 units of beds and everything else now. And then Governor Cuomo called and he wanted it to go COVID, meaning, for the problem. And we said, well it wasn’t supposed to be that way. But we want to get it done. And we moved military personnel. So now military personnel are operating it. And I’ll tell you what’s good. It hasn’t been very full. That’s a good thing, not a bad thing. It hasn’t been. Now, maybe over the next week something will happen, but it hasn’t been. But we have, because it’s better than the other alternative where we run out."
2020-04-05,01:18:24,Donald Trump,"But they built, actually, 2,900 beds. And also, we built four medical centers in New York. We’ve built four hospitals, four medical centers. And a lot more than that. It’s such an honor to have done it, but the people that did it are amazing and they have to be appreciated by the States. Not me. They don’t have to appreciate me at all. I don’t care about me. They have to appreciate the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses. I mean, we’re bringing now 3000 people in that are medical professionals, that are coming from all over the country to help New York City, help New York State, and help many other places. I just think it’s incredible what they’ve done, and I don’t think that they’ve been appreciated. Me, you can forget about. Me, you can-"
2020-04-05,01:19:14,Unnamed,"Really, sir? [crosstalk 01:19:14]"
2020-04-05,01:19:14,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I actually mean it. They have to be appreciated. Go in the back, please."
2020-04-05,01:19:23,Unnamed,[inaudible 01:19:23] When you said that you’re seeing the lights at the end of the tunnel. And yesterday you said-
2020-04-05,01:19:26,Donald Trump,"I do. I do. I see light at the end of the tunnel. If I didn’t, I would not be very thrilled with what we’ve done. No, I see light at the end of the tunnel. I think, indications are some of the numbers coming out today. I think, we had a very good meeting today. We’re seeing things that we don’t even report because we think it’s too early to report. No, I think we’re seeing things happen that are very good."
2020-04-05,01:19:52,Donald Trump,"And we also know, all of us, including the medical professionals, that we have to open our country up. We have to get, we have to open our country up. No country was designed for this, where you close it. We’re in the midst of the greatest economic boom in history, for any country. Our country had the greatest economic boom in history. We had the most people working that we’ve ever had, almost 160 million people. And then, from 160 million, they want nobody to leave their house. You use the term cold turkey, right? That’s called cold turkey. A country is not designed, this country is not designed for that. We have to get our country back and I think it’s going to come back and I hope it’s going to come back very quickly."
2020-04-05,01:20:41,Unnamed,But my question [crosstalk 01:20:37].
2020-04-05,01:20:41,Donald Trump,Please go ahead.
2020-04-05,01:20:41,Unnamed,"Sir, the First Lady has been tweeting and encouraging people to wear face masks."
2020-04-05,01:20:44,Donald Trump,That’s good.
2020-04-05,01:20:44,Unnamed,Has she been talking to you about this?
2020-04-05,01:20:45,Donald Trump,"No, she feels that way."
2020-04-05,01:20:46,Unnamed,Encouraging you to wear one?
2020-04-05,01:20:47,Donald Trump,"She feels that… I would wear one. I mean, I just generally am not in a… Like, I should, would you like me to wear one right now answering your question? That would be a little awkward, I guess. But no. I mean, again, I would wear one if it was, if I thought it was important. She likes the idea of wearing it. Yeah, she does. A lot of people do. Again, it’s a recommendation and I understand that recommendation. And I’m okay with it."
2020-04-05,01:21:14,Unnamed,"What about your family in New York, are they going to be wearing them? Are you encouraging them to wear them?"
2020-04-05,01:21:19,Donald Trump,Wouldn’t be surprised.
2020-04-05,01:21:22,Unnamed,"Can we hear from Dr. Fauci, Mr. President?"
2020-04-05,01:21:23,Donald Trump,Sure. What would you like to know?
2020-04-05,01:21:26,Unnamed,"If we’re going into this most difficult of times, how can the American people sort of emotionally prepare for that? And while the president is talking and is eager to see the country reopened, how do we balance the mitigating factors that still need to take place before we get to that point?"
2020-04-05,01:21:43,Donald Trump,"Sure. Doctor? And by the way, he’d like to see the company open too."
2020-04-05,01:21:46,Unnamed,"Everyone would, sir."
2020-04-05,01:21:48,Donald Trump,It’s called an American who loves our country.
2020-04-05,01:21:51,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Okay. So part of the answer to your question, I think, relates to two other questions I heard. And I think it came from the back about how can you, on the one hand… I’ve said yesterday that this is really going to be a bad week. At the same time that we’re talking about the light at the end of the tunnel. It seems to be inherently contradictory, but it really isn’t. And it has to do with what we explained before about the lag in when you look at the indications that Dr. Birx and the president was talking about. Will you see a flattening out of cases? And you don’t see the realization of what that means until two weeks later. So right now, we’re seeing, as we all said correctly, that this is probably going to be a really bad week. That is a reflection of what happened two and a half weeks ago."
2020-04-05,01:22:41,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So if we start seeing now a flattening or a stabilization of cases, what you’re hearing about potential light at the end of the tunnel doesn’t take away from the fact that tomorrow, the next day it’s going to look really bad. So we’ve got to make sure we realize we’re always talking about a two and a half week lag. So I wanted to make sure, because I think a couple of people ask that question. It’s really not incompatible with what we’re saying. Now with regards to what do we tell the American people? Kelly, what we’ve been telling them all along. That the only tool, but the best tool we have is mitigation. We know it worked in other countries and we’re seeing how it’s working here. So if we really want to make sure that we don’t have these kinds of rebounds that we’re worried about, it’s mitigation, mitigation, mitigation. That’s the answer."
2020-04-05,01:23:31,Unnamed,"As new cities and new states come on the chart, what’s the message for people in those places that have not been the focus?"
2020-04-05,01:23:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"It’s the same thing. It’s mitigation, mitigation, mitigation. And in fact, here’s the famous Vice President chart. Is that this is the minimal of what we should be doing. Everyone should be doing that. And everything on here, one way or the other, points to physical separation. Whether it’s no crowds, whether it’s six feet, whether it’s staying away from theaters and restaurants and what have you."
2020-04-05,01:24:06,Unnamed,And churches and places of worship?
2020-04-05,01:24:07,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Exactly, exactly."
2020-04-05,01:24:09,Unnamed,"Doctor, are you worried at all about people becoming complacent, though? Are you worried? I mean, because a couple of days of this, I think people about ready to go nuts staying in their house. And I’m just curious, are you worried at all that after seven days from now people are going to say, “Look, I gave it my best shot but I’ve got to get out?” I mean."
2020-04-05,01:24:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I wouldn’t say I’m worried about it because I don’t think it’s going to happen. I mean, from what I’ve seen, and I mentioned that the other day, my own experience is that people really understand the responsibility that they have for themselves, for their family and for the country. So this is about all of us. This isn’t just about us. Because if everybody does their part, you are going to not have those kinds of rebounds that we’re worried about."
2020-04-05,01:24:45,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, how many additional asymptomatic cases do you think there are currently in the United States? There’s 330,000 more confirmed cases. How many asymptomatic, given what we’ve learned [crosstalk 01:24:56]."
2020-04-05,01:24:56,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"We don’t know. And even among us, good friends that we all are, we differ about that. I mean, it’s somewhere between 25 and 50%."
2020-04-05,01:25:06,Unnamed,More than the current level?
2020-04-05,01:25:07,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"In other words, about the people that are out there. Yeah. And trust me, that is a estimate. I don’t have any scientific data yet to say that. You know when we’ll get the scientific data? When we get those antibody tests out there and we really know what the penetrance is, then we can answer the questions in a scientifically sound way. Right now, we’re just guessing."
2020-04-05,01:25:29,Unnamed,And would you say-
2020-04-05,01:25:30,Donald Trump,And we’ve made great progress with the antibody testing. Fantastic progress.
2020-04-05,01:25:34,Unnamed,And would you also weigh in on this issue of hydroxychloroquine? What do you think about this and what is the medical evidence?
2020-04-05,01:25:39,Donald Trump,You know how many times he’s answered that question?
2020-04-05,01:25:43,Unnamed,I’d love to hear from the doctor.
2020-04-05,01:25:43,Donald Trump,Maybe 15. 15 times. You don’t have to ask the question.
2020-04-05,01:25:45,Unnamed,"He’s your medical expert, correct?"
2020-04-05,01:25:47,Donald Trump,He answered that question 15 times.
2020-04-05,01:25:48,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, why are you not wearing a face mask?"
2020-04-05,01:25:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Why am I not wearing a face mask now? Okay, there are a couple of reasons. One of them is that part of the, in fact the major reason to wear a face mask is to protect you from infecting you. I had my test yesterday and it’s negative."
2020-04-05,01:26:10,Donald Trump,"Good. Very good answer. All right. I think that really could be it. That was a very, I loved that answer, especially on the face mask. I thought it was very good. Go ahead."
2020-04-05,01:26:22,Unnamed,"Sir, on the equipment issue. Records show that federal agencies did not begin [crosstalk 01:26:30]."
2020-04-05,01:26:27,Donald Trump,"Oh, stop it. Who are you with? By the way, who are you with?"
2020-04-05,01:26:27,Unnamed,"With the Associated Press, sir."
2020-04-05,01:26:27,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-04-05,01:26:27,Unnamed,The Associated Press.
2020-04-05,01:26:32,Donald Trump,That’s another beautiful [ crosstalk 00:01:26:35].
2020-04-05,01:26:32,Unnamed,Agencies didn’t begin [crosstalk 01:26:34] respirators and N95 masks-
2020-04-05,01:26:37,Donald Trump,Are you ready? Are you ready?
2020-04-05,01:26:38,Unnamed,Until mid March.
2020-04-05,01:26:38,Donald Trump,Let me just answer your question because I know exactly. Same question you asked all the time. Ready? They have done an unbelievable job-
2020-04-05,01:26:44,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:26:44].
2020-04-05,01:26:44,Donald Trump,"in delivering for the Associated Press. Which is not so great. Not like it used to be. The people that you’re looking at, FEMA, the military, what they’ve done is a miracle. What they’ve done is a miracle in getting all of this stuff. What they’ve done for States is incredible. And you should be thanking them for what they’ve done. Not always asking wiseguy questions. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you."
2020-04-05,01:27:13,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-06,03:41,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you very much. This week, America continues our aggressive effort to defeat the virus as we enter a crucial and difficult phase of the battle. We continue to send our prayers to the people of New York in New Jersey and to our whole country, but right now New York and New Jersey are very hot zones and we’re with them. We’re with everybody. Your struggle is our struggle and we will beat this virus. We will beat it together. I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation, prime minister, Boris Johnson. We’re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He’s been a really good friend, he’s been really something very special. Strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up."
2020-04-06,04:48,Donald Trump,"We have made tremendous progress on therapeutics. I had a fantastic call today, which I’ll be talking about a little bit later and I’ve asked two of the leading companies, these are brilliant companies, Ebola, AIDS, others, they’ve come with the solutions and just have done incredible jobs. And I’ve asked them to contact London immediately. They have offices in London and major companies, but more than major, more than size, they’re genius. And I had a talk with four of them today and they speak a language that most people don’t even understand, but I understand something that they’ve really advanced therapeutics and therapeutically and they have arrived in London already. Their London office has whatever they need, and we’ll see if we can be of help. We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors and we’ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go. But when you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease."
2020-04-06,06:00,Donald Trump,"So the two companies are there and with what they are talking about and it’s rather complex and has had really incredible results. We’re working with the FDA and everybody else, but we are working with London, with respect to Boris Johnson. Across the country we’re attacking the enemy in all fronts, including medical, scientific, social, logistical and economic. We’re pressing into action the full power of American government and American enterprise and our military has been incredible. We’ve just sent 3,000 public health personnel. They’re now deployed in the New York area and they’ll be over at the Javits center, over at the great ship."
2020-04-06,06:51,Donald Trump,"As you probably have heard, and I was informed that Governor Cuomo has already told you and announced, he called me up a little while ago and he asked whether or not it would be possible to use the ship with respect to fighting the virus. And we hadn’t had that in mind at all, but we’re going to let him do it and we’re also going to let New Jersey, Governor Murphy, we spoke with him a little while ago, and New Jersey is going to use it also because New Jersey is a hotspot. So Governor Murphy and governor Cuomo are going to be using the ship from New York, New Jersey and it’s a big ship and it’s now COVID. It’s set for COVID, and we are going to … Hopefully that will be very helpful to both states."
2020-04-06,07:46,Donald Trump,"The Javits Center, which has 2,900 beds just built by our military also is going to be manned now by the military and they should be in place tomorrow and they’ll start sending quite a few people over to the Javits Center. It’s convenient, it’s right in the middle of everything so that’ll be something great, and we appreciated Governor Cuomo’s nice, really nice statements and likewise Governor Murphy. We have worked very well with both of them and with, frankly, all of the governors. Vice President Pence had a call this morning with them that lasted for close to two hours, and I understand there wasn’t a negative person on the call. 50 governors or just about 50 governors. I think they were all on, from what I understood, and they were very positive about everything their federal government has been doing for them."
2020-04-06,08:42,Donald Trump,"You’ll hear what that is, and it’s rather amazing, actually. Nationwide, the Army Corps of Engineers is building 22 field hospitals, these are big hospitals, and alternate care sites in 18 states. So you have a combination of 22 field hospitals. In addition to that, we’re building ultimate care sites, which is a little bit of a smaller version of the hospital, and we have a lot of them and they’re going up in 18 different states. In total we have deployed 8,450 hospital beds from federal stockpiles, and if you think this has done over really a period of weeks, that’s incredible, actually."
2020-04-06,09:26,Donald Trump,"More than 8,000 ventilators have been sent from the national stockpile to our cities and States backed by the defense production act, which we’ve used very strongly, very powerfully. So powerfully that we don’t have to use it too much, frankly, and it’s nice to when you don’t have to. We’re getting more than we ever bargained for. American industry is stepping up. Manufacturers are really going to town and we have thousands of ventilators being built as we speak and we have hundreds that are being sent to different locations and we’re ready to roll with almost 10,000 that we have in the federal stockpile."
2020-04-06,10:07,Donald Trump,"When I say ready to roll to, I mean exactly what that states. We are … Wherever that monster goes, we’re able to move with it. Great flexibility. We have tremendous flexibility, and we have people waiting and they’re ready, willing and able, but waiting to bring them wherever it may be if they need it. If they need it, it’s possible that they won’t be needed, that we’re fully stocked because numbers are coming in where because of what the American people are doing, we’re having fewer hospital visits. I think that could be the case in New York. It could be the case in a few other states. And fewer beds, fewer hospital visits mean fewer ventilators. So we’ll see whether or not our original projections were right. But anyway, I had a very good talk with both governors and I think they’re very happy, extremely happy about what we’re doing for them. And especially going all COVID. So that’ll take place almost immediately."
2020-04-06,11:09,Donald Trump,"FEMA and HHS have directly distributed 11.7 million N95 respirators. Think of that. Get the number. 11.7 million N95 respirators, 11.7 million. 26.5 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns, and 22.6 million gloves, 22.6 million gloves. We have also arranged for our vast quantities of additional materials to be allocated through donations and existing supply chains. We’ve also given tremendous medical material and supplies throughout the 50 states and territories and through Project Airbridge, we have succeeded in bringing plane loads of vital supplies into the United States from overseas. We had an additional three … These are massive planes by the way. They’re big planes, very big, very powerful and that they’re loaded to the gills with supplies and rather than bringing them into our stock file, as we’ve discussed, we bring them to all the different locations where they’re needed so we can save a big step, and a timely step."
2020-04-06,12:33,Donald Trump,"Because of my actions under the DPA, I can also announce today that we have reached an agreement, very amicable agreement with 3M for the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high quality face masks each month so that we’re going to be getting, over the next couple of months, 166.5 million masks for our frontline healthcare workers. So the 3M saga ends very happily. We’re very proud to be dealing now with 3M and its CEO, Mike Roman. I just spoke with him and I thanked him for getting it done and Mike was very happy to get it done. Great company. So we’re getting 166.5 million masks and mostly that’s going to be for our front line healthcare workers. Okay. That’s 3M, thank you 3M. Three on. I also want to thank Apple, one of the many great American companies that’s taken into … That’s really leapt into action. Today Apple announced that it is now producing plastic face shields for healthcare workers at the rate of one million per week. One million. And these are the shields that you see on television quite a bit and they’re at the highest level of quality and safety."
2020-04-06,14:03,Donald Trump,"We’re grateful as well to Salesforce, which has donated 48 million pieces of personal protective equipment, including masks, gowns, suits and face shields. So thank you very much to Salesforce. I urge all of our nation’s governors to ensure that the massive deliveries that we’ve made to your states over the past few weeks are distributed as quickly as possible. So again, we’re working very well with the governors. Now they may see you and say, “Oh, we’re not happy.” But they’re very happy on the phone. And Mike Pence is a straight shooter and he had a great phone conversation to them with all of the … Teleconference and they’re very happy, every one of them. Were there any negatives?"
2020-04-06,14:50,Mike Pence,No sir.
2020-04-06,14:51,Donald Trump,"See? I told you. Mike is the greatest. Mike … And you have done a great job. Mike, and I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it. Anthony appreciates it, right? Don’t you? See? Everybody appreciates Mike. Special man. So a lot of the things that we’ve done, again, are going directly to the states. The states seem to be very happy if they’re not, they can call me directly, they can call Mike directly and we’ll make them happy. But tremendous progress has been made in a very short period. And I think very importantly the progress has been made before the surge comes. Because the next week, week and a half is going to be a big surge, the professionals tell us, and I think we’re in good shape for it, Anthony, so it’s good timing, really good timing. We can have this stuff there. It’s already there for the most part, but we’re bringing a lot of different resources to the various locations, especially where the surge is looking like it’s going to take place. Resources from the national stockpile need to reach our warriors, and they are warriors."
2020-04-06,15:55,Donald Trump,"I tell it all the time. I saw it again this morning. These young and many cases, many cases older, but they’re walking into the hospital and they’re putting on … I mean, as their doors open, they’re going into this place and it’s not exactly to safe and they’re going in there and they’re putting the outfits on, they’re putting their masks on and they’re … It’s incredible. It’s like no different than you watch the war movies or you watch the old clips of war, running up hills. To me it’s the same thing. Men and women, young and old, but a lot of young people just going in there. They’re not thinking about, “Oh gee, this is dangerous.” They’re not saying, “I don’t want to go in.” They’re warriors, they’re running through those doors. It’s the most incredible thing. It’s beautiful, it’s an incredible, beautiful thing."
2020-04-06,16:48,Donald Trump,"Resources from the national stockpile need to reach these warriors in the hospitals immediately, and we’re making sure they do. And again, the states have that responsibility, but we’re working with the states, we’re getting the states a lot of things that they could distribute, or when they tell us we bring it directly to the hospital from the federal stockpile or from the planes that land, without even going to the stockpile. If any state’s having difficulty distributing supplies, we urge you to use the National Guard to assist in the delivery. And I have to say you have done a fantastic job. Debra, you know that you’ve done great. Tony, you know that you’ve done great, but what a job you’ve done and I appreciate it. I really do. Your whole group has been incredible. That’s a lot of stars you have. I’ll tell you that. He’s supposed to do a great job when you have four stars. Right? But the military has been incredible and I thank them for all of us."
2020-04-06,17:49,Donald Trump,"Conversely, if a state believes that it has surplus equipment or supplies, very important because we actually have gotten so much to some of the States that they are able to now … They’ve done a fantastic job and they’ve kept that line low and we have some States that have surplus equipment and supplies and they’re working with us to rapidly redeploy those supplies to areas of greatest need. We thought that might happen. If it worked out well, that’s what was going to happen and it’s happening and I want to thank Governor Gavin Newsome, who is doing a tremendous job, who’s announced California will send 500 ventilators to be distributed to other locations. I think some are going to Arizona, some are going to Washington DC."
2020-04-06,18:38,Donald Trump,"We think they’re going to Delaware. We’re working to that, but 500 excess of ventilators from the state of California and we’re going to get them taken care of wherever they have to go. Those decisions are being made right now. The members of the White House task force and I are in close touch with mayors and governors and hospital administrators of course our country, and we’re told that the present time, at the present time, most of the critical needs are being more than met. States have to continue sharing detailed information and the amount and utilization rates of medical supplies so we know what to resupply them or they can get it directly. That includes ventilators. They can get it directly, ideally they can get it directly, but if they can’t, if they’re unable to do it, we have tremendous amounts of supplies and we’re building it up very fast too, and this is before the big surge."
2020-04-06,19:40,Donald Trump,"This information is fundamental to our ability to deliver the material when and where it’s most needed. Now, Mike in his conversation today, I think got some information as to a couple of locations where we’re going to be delivering large numbers of ventilators and large numbers of medical supplies, and we’ll take care of that. But some of the States are very happy. Even Governor Pritzker from Illinois is happy. Of course, he may not be happy when he talks to the press, but he’s happy. He’s a very happy man. We’re increasingly hopeful that the aggressive mitigation strategy we put into place will ultimately allow our hospital system to successfully manage the major influx of cases that we have right now. Again, I say that we’re finding, because of the incredible job done by the American people, in conjunction with everybody, governors, the military, federal government, state government, local government, had a lot of conversations with New York City and Mayor De Blasio."
2020-04-06,20:50,Donald Trump,"I’ve gotten to know him. I didn’t know him, gotten to know him and a lot of people are working hard. Everybody’s working hard. A lot of people are doing a great job, tell you that, a lot of people are doing a great job. But the goal is that all Americans have been sacrificing to achieve these last few weeks, things that a lot of people thought were not possible to achieve, and I think we’ve more than achieved, but we have to go through, again, we’re going to have a rough week. We’re going to have maybe a rough little more than a week, but there’s tremendous light at the end of that tunnel. I said it last time, said it last night. There’s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel. There’s so many things happening with therapeutics, with vaccines, with things that we really want. Debra, Tony, they’re all working so hard on this, but those therapeutics,"
2020-04-06,21:41,Donald Trump,"I mean, look, the vaccines are going to be always a little bit later because of that testing period. But the therapeutics getting the kinds of things that I heard about today, talking to these brilliant companies and brilliant people on the phone was fantastic. It was such an incredible conversation. I also spoke just a few minutes ago with former Vice President Biden who called and we had a really wonderful warm conversation. It was a very nice conversation. We talked about pretty much this, this is what we talked about, this is what everyone’s talking about, this is what they want to talk about. And he gave me his point of view and I fully understood that, and we just had a very friendly conversation. Lasted probably 15 minutes, and it was really good. It was really good. Really nice. I think it was very much so. I appreciate his calling. As we continue our efforts to develop treatments and cures, this afternoon I spoke with leaders of the American pharmaceutical companies, and just to give you their names, Amgen, Genentech, Gilead, Regeneron. These are four of the greatest in the world for doing exactly what they’re doing."
2020-04-06,23:04,Donald Trump,"Currently 10 different therapeutic agents are inactive trials and some are looking incredibly successful, but we have to go through a process and it’s got to be a fairly quick process, I will tell you, based on what the FDA told me. And another 15 are in plans for clinical trials, so they’re advancing rapidly and today a second company announced that the FDA has authorized its vaccine candidate to begin clinical trial. So you have Johnson and Johnson is already there. I believe they’re the one that’s first, and now we have a second company that just announced and we were just … Was just approved. So we have two companies at level for the vaccine. We’ve now performed 100 … Well, if you think of this, 1.79 million tests, that’s 1,790,000 test nationwide. And I think we’re going to put up a screen here someplace that they’re on cue, but just on cue."
2020-04-06,24:07,Donald Trump,"Here it is. This is the process starting on five March and ending right there, right about now, right? That’s about it. And it’s going up at a rapid rate. Nobody has done more testing. And one of the reasons why they say, and I think I can say this, Debra, very strongly, but one of the reasons that we have more cases is we’ve done more testing. And if I went to some of these countries that have, in my opinion, far more people than we do that had the problem. And if we did the kind of testing proportionally that we’re doing that have many more cases than us, but we have more cases because we do much more testing. So when you do the testing, you have cases, otherwise you wouldn’t know about the cases. People sit home, you don’t know about it. But we have now done 1, 790,000 tests nationwide."
2020-04-06,25:03,Donald Trump,"That’s more than any other country in the world, hence we have more cases and that number is growing by nearly 125,000 people per day. Think of that one. So it’s growing by 125,000 people per day. I told you about South Korea. This is vastly faster and we also have, they say, the most accurate of tests. CVS is launching, and they’ve been great, two new drive through testing sites and Atlanta, Georgia and Providence, Rhode Island and each location would be able to test up to 1,000 patients per day using the ultra fast five minute test developed by Abbott Labs. Now they’re down to five minutes. They go to the ultra fast. It’s very accurate. Abbott Labs, I want to thank them. They’ve been fantastic. We’re also speeding urgent economic relief to the American worker and families and the employers."
2020-04-06,26:05,Donald Trump,"As of today, tens of thousands of small businesses have applied for more than $40 billion in relief under the paycheck protection program. You’ve all been reading about it and it’s really … I mean, it’s only been going for a couple of days. It’s really been performing well. A couple of little glitches, minor glitches that are already been taken care of, what they say. These funds were resulted in nearly two million jobs being preserved, so we’re taking care of our workers, small businesses and our workers. Nearly 3,000 lenders have already made loans under the program and we’re signing up additional lenders very quickly, rapidly. Community banks have been very responsive and larger banks are also stepping up if this … If we run out of funds, by the way, we’re already preparing because it’s going so fast for the small businesses and their employees, we’ll ask Congress to refill it immediately, but the banks have been great."
2020-04-06,27:01,Donald Trump,"The big banks, the Bank of America was right up there at the beginning. JP Morgan Chase was … Has been great. After the first day, they really came through and a lot of the big banks, but the community banks have been fantastic. As we announced last week, we are providing $100 billion in direct support for our hospitals. And the first traunch, $30 billion, will be distributed this week. I want to say one other thing. Our farmers, we love our farmers, and as you know, as of April 1st the China trade deal, $250 billion, they purchased $250 billion from us, if not more. And of that, approximately 50 billion is expected to be with our farmers. So it kicked in as of April 1st and we’ll see how it goes. It seems like they’re buying. So we’ll let you know how that’s going, but they’re buying anywhere from 40 to $50 billion worth of our agricultural product. That should have a huge impact on our farmers, a tremendous impact on our farmers. But we’re watching it very closely."
2020-04-06,28:14,Donald Trump,"To fight the medical war, we’ve mobilized the unbeatable and it just … It is unbeatable strength of American determination, ingenuity and compassion. I got to see that when I spoke to the great science, because I call them science companies more than drug companies, they’re scientists. We’ve seen businesses, charities, and private citizens making generous donations. So many people are making donations. We’ve seen states and cities supporting and helping each other and caring for our citizens, and we’ve seen Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs uniting together to answer the challenge and rise to the moment, and that’s what they’re doing. Above all, we’ve been awed, inspired by the exceptional courage of the doctors, nurses, EMTS, and healthcare workers, who are the soldiers of this war. No words can ever express the complete measure of our gratitude for these intrepid heroes."
2020-04-06,29:14,Donald Trump,"One Cleveland patient credited his medical team for not only saving his life through their skill, but forever changing his life through their example of selfless devotion. Couldn’t believe it. So generous he was with his statements and he talked about their bravery in an area that was in such trouble, an area of that hospital where people were dying and he talked about their bravery. Another survivor in Euston said simply, “I will consider them my angels forever.” I will consider them, think of that, my angels forever as our nation endures the depths of loss and grief. We also witnessed to the summit of American virtue, character, and courage with the love and dedication of every American Patriot. We will win this battle, we will defeat this enemy, and we will rise from this present crisis with new strength, unity, and resolve and that’s what’s happening."
2020-04-06,30:13,Donald Trump,"Tremendous stories are coming out of this horrible moment, very dark moment for the world. 182. I was saying 151 for a while and then it got up to 160 and 182, as I announced yesterday, 182 countries are being attacked by this virus. So I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank the American citizens for doing a great job. Stay inside and let’s win this and let’s get our country open as soon as we can. I think it’s going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well. Again, light at the end of the tunnel. And with that I’ll take a few questions and then Mike is going to take over and talk with the admiral and with the professionals and we appreciate you being here. Yes, please?"
2020-04-06,31:07,Unnamed,"Mister president, you mentioned that you were asking US drug companies to provide treatment to the British prime minister. What sort of treatment is that? Is that something that’s available?"
2020-04-06,31:15,Donald Trump,"Yeah, it’s a very complex treatment of things that they’ve just recently developed and that they have a lot of experience with having to do with something else, but recent for this. And they’ve already concurred, they’ve already had meetings with the doctors and we’ll see whether or not they want to go that route. But when you’re in intensive care, it’s a big deal. So they’re there and they’re ready. I think we have … Well, we have three of them. I spoke with four, you know who the four would be, and the people within those, you’d know the companies, I told you the companies, but the people are the greatest in the world. So they’re at the hospital and we’ll see. And they have everything with them should it be needed. Hopefully it won’t have to be needed, but should it be needed. I found Boris to be a fantastic person, just like a fantastic warm, strong, smart guy. He loves his country. You see that. I mean, he fought like hell for his country. And intensive care is big stuff. Really big."
2020-04-06,32:27,Unnamed,"Yesterday you were asked about this as well, but now that he’s been moved to intensive care, does that give you and the vice president any pause or additional concerns, steps that you’re taking to preserve the [inaudible 00:32:36] of government here?"
2020-04-06,32:37,Donald Trump,"I don’t think so. Mike had his test a couple of days ago. I had my test couple of days ago. And we’re here and here you are. So no, I don’t think so. But I think we’ll probably … Just because of the questions like that, I think we’ll probably have maybe quite a few tests. It’s not the worst idea. The system of testing now is so quick and so easy. So I could see … And you were tested again today? You sure you’re okay?"
2020-04-06,33:03,Mike Pence,I’m okay.
2020-04-06,33:03,Donald Trump,[inaudible 00:33:08].
2020-04-06,33:07,Unnamed,"Despite the nearly 1.8 million tests that you say the United States has done, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services released a report today, a survey of more than 300 hospitals across the country. And the number one complaint from those hospitals were severe shortages of testing supplies and really long wait time, [crosstalk 00:33:32]."
2020-04-06,33:31,Donald Trump,Did I hear the word inspector general? Really? It’s wrong. And they’ll talk to you about it. It’s wrong.
2020-04-06,33:36,Unnamed,But this is your own government.
2020-04-06,33:39,Donald Trump,"Well, where did he come from, the inspector general. What’s his name?"
2020-04-06,33:42,Unnamed,It came from the inspector general.
2020-04-06,33:43,Donald Trump,What’s his name?
2020-04-06,33:45,Unnamed,I don’t know his name.
2020-04-06,33:45,Donald Trump,"Well, find me his name, let me know. Okay? If you find me his name, I’d appreciate it."
2020-04-06,33:49,Unnamed,"But sir, these are hot-"
2020-04-06,33:51,Donald Trump,"All I can tell you is this. It’s been put up on the board, you’re going to ask the admiral, but we are doing-"
2020-04-06,33:58,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:33:58] who say that they are waiting a week or longer to get their test results. Why-
2020-04-06,34:03,Donald Trump,We’ve done more-
2020-04-06,34:03,Unnamed,-to get their tests. Why is it still taking so long?
2020-04-06,34:03,Donald Trump,"We’ve I’ve done more testing and had more results than any country, anywhere in the world. They’re doing an incredible job now. They’re all calling us. They want our testing. What are we doing? How do you do the five minute test? How do you do the 15 minute test? So give me the name of the inspector general. Could politics be entered into that? Go ahead, please. Go ahead."
2020-04-06,34:23,Jonathan Karl,"Thank you, sir. Are you worried about retaliation to your decision to ban export of medical goods, like Indian Prime Minister Modi’s decision to not export hydroxychloroquine to the United States and other country?"
2020-04-06,34:36,Donald Trump,"I don’t like that decision. I didn’t hear that that was his decision. I know that he stopped it for other countries. I spoke to him yesterday. We had a very good talk and we’ll see whether or not that is. I would be surprised if he would because India does very well with the United States. For many years they’ve been taken advantage of the United States on trade. So I would be surprised if that were his decision. He’d have to tell me that. I spoke to him Sunday morning, called him, and I said, we’d appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesn’t allow it to come out, that would be okay. But of course there may be retaliation. Why wouldn’t there be? Yeah."
2020-04-06,35:12,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. The Paycheck Protection Program has gotten off to a confusing start for small businesses."
2020-04-06,35:18,Donald Trump,I don’t think so. I think it’s done very well.
2020-04-06,35:19,Unnamed,Wells Fargo has stopped taking applications. Bank of America-
2020-04-06,35:23,Donald Trump,Not any more they haven’t.
2020-04-06,35:25,Unnamed,– ensuring they prioritized taking applications from clients that were already [crosstalk 00:35:30].
2020-04-06,35:29,Donald Trump,"Bank of America has been the leader. Taking tremendous numbers of applications, and of course there may have been, they wanted to have a slightly different application. They wanted to have a little different information, but Bank of America has been a leader. They had number one in terms of applications."
2020-04-06,35:45,Donald Trump,"I wish you’d ask the question differently. Why don’t you say “It’s gotten off to a tremendous start, but there were some little glitches,” which by the way, have been worked out. It will be so much nicer if you do that, but you’re just incapable of asking a question."
2020-04-06,35:58,Unnamed,What oversight measures is the federal government putting in place-
2020-04-06,36:01,Donald Trump,It’s already done. It’s already done.
2020-04-06,36:03,Unnamed,-to ensure that there is fairness?
2020-04-06,36:05,Donald Trump,"It’s taking the measures and we may even do a different system. Not with this. We’re going to have to probably add more money to this to save and to keep our small businesses going and to keep the employees of those small businesses working. But it’s such a positive event and you ask it in such a negative way. It’s just, I wish we had a fair media in this country and we really don’t. Speaking of unfair, go right ahead."
2020-04-06,36:31,Unnamed,"Mr. President, the acting Secretary of the Navy told the crew of the USS Roosevelt that Captain Crozier was either “too naive or too stupid” to be in command. Is it appropriate for the chief officer of the Navy to speak in his way about this captain?"
2020-04-06,36:45,Donald Trump,"Well I haven’t heard it exactly. I haven’t heard. I heard they had a statement that was made. If that were the statement, it’s a strong statement. Look, the letters shouldn’t have been sent and certainly they shouldn’t have been leaked. This is a military operation. I must tell you, I’ve heard very good things about the gentleman, both gentlemen, by the way, I will say this, but about both gentlemen. And I may look into it only from the standpoint that something should be resolved because I’m hearing good things about both people."
2020-04-06,37:18,Unnamed,What might you look into sir?
2020-04-06,37:20,Donald Trump,"I may just get involved if it’s okay with you. Because you know what? You have two good people and they’re arguing and I’m good, believe it or not, at settling arguments. I’m good at settling these arguments. So I may look into it in detail and I’ll be able to figure it out very fast."
2020-04-06,37:38,Donald Trump,"But that was a statement. It’s a rough statement, but look letters should not have been sent to many people unclassified. That was a mistake. It’s a mistake that shouldn’t have been made because it’s unfair to the families of the people on the ship because they get nervous and it shows weakness and there’s nothing weak about us now. Not anymore."
2020-04-06,38:03,Donald Trump,"We have the strongest military we’ve ever had, and we’re not going to be showing weakness to anybody because we have… That ship is incredible, nuclear powered aircraft carrier. And we don’t want to be doing writing letters. We don’t want to have letter writing campaigns where the fake news finds a letter or gets a leak. We don’t want that. So the letter, excuse me, so the letter shouldn’t have been sent."
2020-04-06,38:25,Donald Trump,With all of that said his career prior to that was very good. So I’m going to get involved and see exactly what’s going on there because I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day. Okay. Does that make sense?
2020-04-06,38:39,Unnamed,"Okay. Mr. President, Vice President Biden’s a spokesperson, said that he’d made some suggestions to you about actions that you could be taking to deal with the pandemic."
2020-04-06,38:49,Donald Trump,"He did. We agreed that we weren’t going to talk about what we said, but we had a very, very good talk. It was a warm talk. I enjoyed it. I hope he enjoyed it too. And it was short. It was 15 minutes."
2020-04-06,39:03,Unnamed,"Did he have good suggestions, anything that you’re going do?"
2020-04-06,39:03,Donald Trump,"He had suggestions. It doesn’t mean that I agree with those suggestions, but certainly he had suggestions, and I also told him some of the things we’re doing, but the conversation was a friendly, very friendly conversation."
2020-04-06,39:14,Unnamed,"Yeah. Thanks a lot, Mr. President, you’ve mentioned other members of your task force had mentioned over the course of the next two weeks, it’s going to be a very difficult time for our country in terms of fatalities and-"
2020-04-06,39:26,Donald Trump,It will be a difficult week and a half.
2020-04-06,39:28,Unnamed,"And there are a number of governors who are close allies of yours, Mr. President, who have refrained thus far to have these stay at home orders and Dr. Fauci who of course is on your task force has said that the states that don’t have stay at home orders are putting themselves at risk and the country at risk."
2020-04-06,39:47,Donald Trump,"If Dr. Fauci said that I would be inclined to call them up. We do have a constitutional problem in doing that. You understand that? There’s a double edge, so you understand. I can do it, but it is a constitutional, you can say Federalists, you can say there’s lots of different reasons where I would rather have the governors do it, make their own determination. They’re smaller, and not in all cases, but sort of their smaller cases. But I’m not sure 100% that Dr. Fauci said that. But you can ask him. Do you want to say something please."
2020-04-06,40:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I had good conversations with the governor of Nebraska and the governor of Iowa here. And it’s, interesting that functionally, even though they have not given a strict stay at home, what they are doing is really functionally equivalent to that. And we had a really good conversation with both of the governors. And when I had mentioned that I think there was a public response that they weren’t really doing anything at all and they really are doing a very good job, both of them. Those are the only two that I spoke to. But it was really good conversation and I want to make sure people understand that just because they don’t have a very strict stay at home order, they have in place a lot of things that are totally compatible with what everyone else is doing."
2020-04-06,41:04,Jonathan Karl,"If I can ask a question, Dr. Fauci."
2020-04-06,41:07,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-06,41:08,Jonathan Karl,About getting back to normal. You said you wanted to get back to normal as soon as possible. Will we truly get back to normal in this country before there’s an actual vaccine that’s available to everybody? How do you start lifting the restrictions?
2020-04-06,41:23,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah, well, Jon if back to normal means acting like there never was a coronavirus problem, I don’t think that’s going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population. But when we say getting back to normal, we mean something very different from what we’re going through right now. Because right now we are in a very intense mitigation. When we get back to normal, we will go back gradually to the point where we can function as a society. But you’re absolutely right. If you want to get to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there, but I believe with the therapies that will be coming online and with the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine that we will never have to get back to where we are right now. So if that means getting back to normal, then we’ll get back to normal."
2020-04-06,42:13,Donald Trump,"I think that with the therapies and I think that with the vaccines, which I have total confidence are coming and I’m dealing with the companies, I’m talking to Johnson and Johnson, I’m talking to all of them. I think that when you add the tremendous stimulus that we’re giving, like for instance, deductibility for restaurant expenses, for restaurants and entertainment. The money that we’re talking about for small businesses and employers to keep everybody working, and other things that we’re frankly working on right now, which are going to be great for our people. I think when you add that to it, I think we could get more than back to normal from an economic standpoint, actually be better but more than back to normal."
2020-04-06,42:54,Donald Trump,"But I would agree that we’d love to see a vaccine but immediately would love to see a therapeutic, and I think we’re getting great close."
2020-04-06,43:03,Unnamed,You think you’d be able to lift restrictions on April 30th right now-
2020-04-06,43:06,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to comment on that. But I can tell you that we certainly want to try. We certainly want to see what’s going on. We’re doing very well. Look, you look at most places where you can call it the bump. You could go up the hill, you could go up the mountain, you can call it whatever you want to do it. It’s very flat. You take a look. And that was done through mitigation. That was done through a lot of good work. And that far exceeded our expectations before."
2020-04-06,43:32,Donald Trump,"People can’t even believe how low some of those bumps are, some of those hills are, they’re very surprised. They have a couple of tough ones. New Jersey has been very tough and New York has been very tough. They’re crowded in. It’s tight, it’s tougher, but far exceeding, California far exceeds, Washington State far exceeds. You look at so many of these states how well they’re doing."
2020-04-06,43:59,Donald Trump,"The eight states by the way. And I haven’t spoken to the governors, but Tony’s so right. They may not have it from the standpoint that they’re saying it, but those people are practicing it and they’re doing a fantastic job. Take a look at where they are in terms of the levels, but take a look where they are. But if I thought it was something that, and I’ve looked at them and I’ve looked at them very carefully. I looked at them today, looked at them yesterday. From a constitutional standpoint, I’d love not to get involved with that and not from a legal standpoint, just from a moral constitutional standpoint. Because legally I can, but morally, and I believe in our constitution much more so than most people. And I’d love to be able to let the governors do what they have to do. Those states are doing a fantastic job. All eight of them, they’re doing a fantastic job. So we’ll see what happens. As for your question, you fully understand what I’m saying. So thank you."
2020-04-06,45:03,Unnamed,"I have two questions if I may, one from somebody outside of the room. But first, do you think Boris Johnson, when he talked about so shaking hands of hospital patients, did he downplay the threat of this virus too much and do you know exactly what his current condition is?"
2020-04-06,45:17,Donald Trump,"I think Boris was looking at it differently. He was looking at it earlier. He was looking at it like ride it out. There were many people thinking about riding it out. Meaning whatever it is, it is. But then you see what starts to happen and the numbers become monumental and they decided not to do that. And we actually moved early. We moved early because of what we did with respect to the ban on China coming in. And then Europe coming in. That was an early ban too. And then UK."
2020-04-06,45:47,Donald Trump,"So no, he waited a little while and he felt that, but he made a decision very quickly thereafter to do what they did and they’ve gone to a very strict lockdown. But they’re suffering greatly as a nation right now. They’re going through a lot. They’re a nation that’s having a difficult time. But I’ve gotten to know him. He’s just such an incredible guy. It was just so shocking to see that because you know what that means. Intensive care is a big deal with regard to what we’re talking about. That’s a very big deal. Very scary deal."
2020-04-06,46:23,Unnamed,"Just somebody would can’t be in the room because of social distancing has asked me to ask a question. It’s a Thomas Howell of the Washington Times, how many health workers in the US have become infected with COVID-19? If the answer is not know, will the CDC be publishing that data?"
2020-04-06,46:38,Donald Trump,"I can get you that information. I think they’d probably be willing to give that, right? Yeah, we could get you that information. Jeff."
2020-04-06,46:45,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President OPEC is meeting on Thursday and they have said that they are willing to make a cut in production if the US chips in as well, which suggests that they want you to ask US producers to do [crosstalk 00:46:58]."
2020-04-06,46:57,Donald Trump,"We’ll you’re the first one that’s told me that. We’ll have to make that decision and maybe we will. Maybe we won’t, but we’ll have to make that decision. I think the cuts are automatic, if you’re a believer in markets. I can guarantee you there’s a cut from pre this condition. This happened because of the virus. The virus knocked out 40%. It went down in one hour, literally when places close up, you’re talking about a 40% cut. Now, I think it’s happening automatically, but nobody’s asked me that question yet, so we’ll see what happens. I’ll let you know Thursday evening."
2020-04-06,47:32,Jeff (Reporter),All right. That’s a deal. But you would consider asking US companies to reduce?
2020-04-06,47:36,Donald Trump,"I think it’s automatic. because they’re already cutting. If you look, they’re cutting back because it’s market, it’s demand, it’s supply and demand. They’re already cutting back and they’re cutting back very seriously."
2020-04-06,47:48,Jeff (Reporter),But if OFAC is asking for a signal from the US-
2020-04-06,47:51,Donald Trump,"Nobody’s asked me that. So if they ask I’ll make a decision. Okay. But again, it’s happening anyway. Yes please."
2020-04-06,47:58,Unnamed,"In light of all the discussion about Prime Minister Johnson and his health, can you update us on the status of the second half of your physical that you were going to have this year?"
2020-04-06,48:07,Donald Trump,"Yes, so I had physical, the first half was very successful. I did it on a day when I was in the White House and we were able to do that as the doctor reported. And I have some… The second half of the physical different, probably is done at Walter Reed and I’ll do that at the appropriate time, but I feel very good and according to the doctor very good shape."
2020-04-06,48:29,Unnamed,"Can I just ask you again on the idea of a national stay at home recommendation, what is giving you so much pause about making that recommendation?"
2020-04-06,48:38,Donald Trump,I told you. I told you. He understood very well. I appreciate your understanding.
2020-04-06,48:42,Unnamed,It’s not an order-
2020-04-06,48:42,Donald Trump,"It’s called the Constitution of the United States and I’d rather have if possible, the governors to make the decision. If a decision was very necessary, and they have done a good job and Tony said it better than anybody. They are doing what we’re asking them to do without having to put the seal on it. But I will say if I thought it was necessary, I’ll do it in a heartbeat."
2020-04-06,49:06,Unnamed,Do you agree with the Georgia governor opening the beaches.
2020-04-06,49:09,Donald Trump,Opening what?
2020-04-06,49:10,Unnamed,The beaches.
2020-04-06,49:11,Donald Trump,"I haven’t seen, I’m going to have to see to what extent, I’m going to have to see how many people you’re talking about. Are they crowded? Are they packed? Are they not packed? We’ll have to take a look at it. Right now it’s very early for beaches in Georgia, so right now very early, so I’ll take a look at it. He’s done a very good job as the governor. He knows what he’s doing, but we’ll have to take a look. It really does depend on how crowded it may be, but I will talk to him and I will ask him that question. I would ask him. Yes please."
2020-04-06,49:36,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you said last week that you were considering travel restrictions around hotspots. Is that something that’s still on the table and at what point?"
2020-04-06,49:44,Donald Trump,"We’re looking at it and the airlines have been cutting their routes. You saw that yesterday. They announced big cuts in routes. We need some some flights for emergency use for military people. We need some flights for medical people. And there are very few flights as you know, and the flights that are going out I think they said they’re 3% to 4% full. You have 3% of the plane that’s occupied, so they’re generally very, very empty planes."
2020-04-06,50:16,Donald Trump,But it’s good to have. it’s a tiny amount of flights relative to the overall. And we need them also for medical workers. Otherwise we’re going to have to do a whole big thing with our own planes. So they’re done for a reason. There’s also testing done when people get onto those planes and also when people get off the planes.
2020-04-06,50:35,Jonathan Karl,"Mr. President, if I could follow up on this question of the HHS inspector general, and by the way, her name was Christi Grimm and it wasn’t so much her opinion, but they interviewed 323 different hospitals-"
2020-04-06,50:48,Donald Trump,It still could be her opinion. When was she appointed? When was she appointed?
2020-04-06,50:52,Jonathan Karl,I’m not sure when she was appointed.
2020-04-06,50:53,Donald Trump,Will you do me a favor.
2020-04-06,50:54,Jonathan Karl,I’ll check.
2020-04-06,50:55,Donald Trump,"No, no, no. Let me know now. I have to know now, John. Let me know now because we are doing an incredible job in testing. We are doing a better job than anybody in the world right now in testing. There’s nobody close and other nations admit this. Other nations have admitted it very strongly. Other nations are calling us wanting to know about our testing. Let me know when she was appointed, would you?"
2020-04-06,51:15,Jonathan Karl,Specifically what she was saying was there had been a delay in the-
2020-04-06,51:19,Donald Trump,"Okay, thank you very much. Go ahead."
2020-04-06,51:20,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President. Only last week there were multiple flights coming from China full of medical supplies. Companies like Huawei and Alibaba has been donating to the United States 1.5 million N95 masks, and also a lot of medical gloves and much more medical supplies."
2020-04-06,51:44,Donald Trump,Looks like a statement more than a question.
2020-04-06,51:48,Unnamed,Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai last night wrote an oped New York times calling to cooperation with the United States. So are you personally working directly with China-
2020-04-06,52:00,Donald Trump,"We just signed a trade deal. It’s the biggest deal probably ever made and I hope they’re going to honor that trade deal. If they don’t honor the trade deal, then I’ll tell you a different answer, but I think they will. They’re going to spend billions of dollars for agriculture. They’re going to spend billions of dollars for many different things. Whereas China never spent money in our country. We spent money. We had a deficit, a trade deficit with China for years of $500 billion, $400 billion. We had the biggest trade deficits in the history of the world with China. Now China has agreed to spend $250 billion, many billions of dollars in our country. Much of it going to farmers and manufacturers. So I’ll let you know."
2020-04-06,52:48,Donald Trump,I hope they’re going to honor the deal. We’ll find out.
2020-04-06,52:51,Unnamed,Are you cooperating with Chian?
2020-04-06,52:52,Donald Trump,I don’t know. Who are you working for? China? You work for China? Are you with a newspaper? Who are you with?
2020-04-06,52:57,Unnamed,Hong Kong Phoenix TV.
2020-04-06,52:59,Donald Trump,Who owns that? China. Is it owned by China?
2020-04-06,53:02,Unnamed,It’s based in Hong Kong.
2020-04-06,53:02,Donald Trump,Is it owned by the state?
2020-04-06,53:03,Unnamed,"No, it’s not. It’s a private owner of the company."
2020-04-06,53:06,Donald Trump,"Okay, good. Look, I’ll let you know. I’ll give you a good answer to that in a few months. I wanted to just see what they do. Because it’s time for them to help us. It’s time right now for China to help us and hopefully they do. And if they don’t that’s okay too. But we signed a deal. It was signed with great goodwill and spirit and it’s time that our farmers benefited, our manufacturers benefited, and we’ll see whether or not that deal is honored."
2020-04-06,53:36,Donald Trump,"And I think it will be because I know president Xi who I like and respect, and I think he will honor the deal he made with us. It just went into effect four days ago. I will see whether or not… In fact, I called up just a little while ago, I said, “How are the farmers doing with respect to China? Are they buying the product as anticipated?” And the answer was “yeah, I think so,” but it wasn’t the most positive but it was starting. The deal just started. So I’ll let you know. But for many, many years China ate our lunch because we had people in this position that I’m in right now that allowed China to get away with absolute murder and it should have never happened. But we are now dealing with China. We’ll see what happens."
2020-04-06,54:24,Jonathan Karl,"Mr. President, I’ll tell you when she was appointed."
2020-04-06,54:27,Donald Trump,"Wait, how many do you want to ask?"
2020-04-06,54:29,Jonathan Karl,I was going to answer your question you asked me. She was appointed in January of this year to her current position as the principal deputy inspector.
2020-04-06,54:35,Donald Trump,We’re going to take a look at it. Go ahead.
2020-04-06,54:37,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I know you don’t want to talk about We don’t want to talk about-"
2020-04-06,54:38,Donald Trump,Don’t interrupt.
2020-04-06,54:39,Unnamed,"On the issue of small business loan, sir. You said that businesses have applied for $40 billion in loans, but can you us how much of that money has actually gone out to the small businesses?"
2020-04-06,54:50,Donald Trump,"I can’t tell you, but I know it goes out very quickly once the loan applications approved. And the process is very fast and you have to understand these are banks and this is what they do, but they were swamped. They were actually swamped. Okay, go ahead."
2020-04-06,55:03,Unnamed,"I know you don’t want to talk about the inspector general report, but testing is still a big issue in this country. When can hospitals expect?"
2020-04-06,55:11,Donald Trump,Put the slide up again please.
2020-04-06,55:13,Unnamed,When can hospitals expect to receive a quick turnaround of its test results?
2020-04-06,55:18,Donald Trump,"Are you ready? Are you ready? Hospitals can do their own testing also. States can do their own testing. States, they’re supposed to be doing testing. Hospitals as opposed to be doing testing. Do you understand that? We’re the federal government. Listen, we’re the federal government. We’re not supposed to stand on street corners doing testing. They go to doctors, they go to hospitals, they go to the state. The state is a more localized government. You have 50 of them and they can go… you also have territories as you know."
2020-04-06,55:49,Donald Trump,"And they do the testing and if you look at the chart, if you take a look, did they put it up? Yeah, just take a look. And these are testing, and the results are now coming in very quickly. Initially speaking, the tests were old, obsolete and not really prepared. We have a brand new testing system that we developed very quickly and that’s your result. And you should say, congratulations. Great job. Instead of being so horrid in the way you ask a question, please go ahead. I’d love to have the Admiral speak to that question. Yes."
2020-04-06,56:24,Brett Giroir,"So I can talk a little bit more about testing later on. But as the president said, 1.79 million tests have been done, and this does not count the hundreds of thousands of tests that are done within hospitals that are now currently not reporting. So I’m sure we’re well over 2 million."
2020-04-06,56:42,Brett Giroir,"That inspector general report was done here, 23rd, 24th during our ramp up period, quite a long time ago. There was clearly, and it’s hard to interpret the report because it mixes up all kinds of things, but clearly there was complaints by some hospitals of a backlog, probably had sent out tests. And that is true. There were several days of backlog at some of the major labs that have been taken care of. We know now that the ACLA labs now have a 24 to 48 hour turnaround. They’re doing well over 100,000 tests a day. We now have the Abbott machine that’s point of care, that’s 18,000 of those instruments throughout the country. The [inaudible 00:57:25] machine is now all across the country with a 45 minute turnaround. So we have worked directly with many of the hospitals that have their own laboratory derived tests. Some of those really quite frankly didn’t understand the regulatory freedom they have to use other different kinds of instruments or different kinds of reagents. So like they do now, like they do now. And I’m on the phone with them all the time to make sure that everything is clear. We have a 24 hour call number. But that’s what it was there for."
2020-04-06,57:58,Brett Giroir,"And I don’t know the inspector general. I don’t know that person. I tell you one thing I have a problem with. If there was such a problem that she knew about or he knew about on March 23rd and 24th why did I find out about the test from them on the news media at eight o’clock this morning? If there was a problem, I think you’re ethically obliged to tell me where that is so we can interact with it like I do every single day. But that’s a discussion for the future. I think testing is really in a good position right now and I’m happy to expand on some of the really good tests that are coming up."
2020-04-06,58:32,Donald Trump,How long has that person been in government?
2020-04-06,58:35,Jonathan Karl,They did serve in the previous administration.
2020-04-06,58:37,Donald Trump,"Oh, you didn’t tell me that. Oh, I see. You didn’t tell me that, John. You didn’t tell me that. Did serve in the previous admin. You mean the Obama administration? Thank you for telling me that. See, there’s a typical fake news deal."
2020-04-06,58:50,Jonathan Karl,"You asked me when she was appointed, I told you when she was appointed."
2020-04-06,58:53,Donald Trump,"You’re a third rate reporter and what you just said is a disgrace. You asked me, you said, “sir, just got appointed.” Take a look at what you said now. I said, “When did this person, how long in government?” Well, it was appointed in the Obama administration. Thank you very much, John. Thank you very much. You will never make it. Go ahead please."
2020-04-06,59:14,Unnamed,"On the ventilators, [crosstalk 00:59:16] per Admiral Giroir but can you tell us today how many ventilators are in the federal stockpile?"
2020-04-06,59:23,Brett Giroir,"I’m not going to tell you how many are in the stockpile, but I can tell you that we look at ventilator use granularly every single day in every single state and down to the hospital level. So we have been able to meet and easily meet all the ventilator requirements that have been brought us by the state. No one has not gotten the ventilator that needs a ventilator and as far as we can project looking at all models, every person who needs a ventilator will get a ventilator."
2020-04-06,59:50,Brett Giroir,"I’m a ventilator doc, right? I’m an ICU physician for children, spent every day of my life managing people on ventilators. This is my community. It’s also the Surgeon General’s community as an anesthesiologist. So what we have in the stockpile I think is not a number that we give out, but we have thousands remaining in the stockpile, and now you’re seeing either out of the appropriate American spirit that when a state like Washington or California doesn’t need that ventilator, they’re doing the right thing by moving them around the country."
2020-04-06,01:00:21,Donald Trump,"It’s about 9,000, just so you understand. It’s about 9,000. And by the way, you didn’t tell me you also that this inspector general came out of the Obama administration. You didn’t tell me that. Okay, please go ahead. [crosstalk 01:00:37]."
2020-04-06,01:00:36,Unnamed,"Sir, I’m looking at this inspector general’s bio sheet. She has served in government since 1999. I was hoping to ask you about your call with a former Vice President Joe Biden. Is there something that you learned on that phone call and has that changed your [crosstalk 01:00:49]."
2020-04-06,01:00:49,Donald Trump,"No, I understood his views before the call."
2020-04-06,01:00:51,Unnamed,Does that change your opinion about the about speaking to people?
2020-04-06,01:00:53,Donald Trump,"I just think he’s very nice. I think he’s a nice man. I’ve always thought he was a nice man. I don’t know him. I don’t know if I ever spoke to him before other than to say hello, but I think he’s a nice man. We had a very nice call."
2020-04-06,01:01:05,Unnamed,"Do you want seek out the counsel of some of your predecessors, George Bush, Barack Obama-"
2020-04-06,01:01:09,Donald Trump,"No, not really. We’re doing a great job. Hey, I inherited, we this administration. We inherited a broken system both militarily, but we’ve rebuilt our military. We now have so much ammunition where as you remember it, very important, general said, “sir, we have no ammunition.” They wanted to save money on ammunition. They didn’t want to save money because they spent money like nobody ever spent money. But you know what? We now have a great military rebuilt. We have so much ammunition. We don’t know what to do with it. Okay. And that’s a nice feeling to have."
2020-04-06,01:01:41,Donald Trump,"But they also gave us empty cupboards. The cupboard was bare. You’ve heard the expression, the cupboard was bare. So we took over a stockpile with a cupboard was bare and where the testing system was broken and old and we redid it and frankly it would be okay for a small event but not for a big event and they had a chance to do it."
2020-04-06,01:02:00,Donald Trump,"Somebody said that a certain person, I won’t tell you, but a certain person said this will happen and that’s true. The problem is that person never did anything about it. Previous administrations, in previous… they never did anything about it. We all know all about pandemics and all of the things that we’re seeing now, but nobody thought it was going to happen. And if we did think it was going to happen, the problem is nobody did anything about it. We did."
2020-04-06,01:02:26,Donald Trump,"We have rebuilt the system and now we’re a fine tuned machine. We built thousands of hotel beds for New York. We moved a ship in that now we’re going to make for COVID-19. We’re going to make it so that people having this horrible thing happen to them will be able to use the ship. The ship, as I said, is going to be shared with New Jersey, New York and New Jersey."
2020-04-06,01:02:48,Donald Trump,"We’ve done things that are incredible. When you build, what was it, 18 hospitals. We built 18 hospitals. We built medical centers all over the country and when you have Gavin Newsom and other governors who really have been very nice and generous in their statements because they make the statements to the press, not just to my face. Others tell us how great we’re doing. Like the call that Mike had today. I heard from other people that were on the call. He said it was incredible. It was two hours and everything was positive. They were so happy with what we’ve done and we’re ready to do more if they need it because we’re ready to march."
2020-04-06,01:03:23,Donald Trump,"The admiral can tell you we are sitting there with 9,000 ventilators and we’re ready to march. When we see that we can move very quickly. As soon as we see that need, we can move very quickly. We’re ready to march. We built a great system. The problem is the Democrats, like a guy like Chuck Schumer’s a total lightweight, by the way, I’ve known him for a long time. He’ll say, “Why don’t you put a military man in charge?” Military man, I have all military man. This man is doing an incredible job. We have two admirals, numerous generals. We have the Army Corps of Engineers, we have FEMA."
2020-04-06,01:04:02,Donald Trump,"We have this whole force like nobody’s ever seen before. We have a great military operation, and they’ve done an incredible job. And honestly people should respect because nobody’s ever seen anything like what we’ve done. And what they end up with… Thinking about me, don’t worry about me. I will only get bad. If I say, “How many ventilators do you need, governor?” “1,000 would be great.” I said, “No, I’m going to send you 10,000.” And then you’ll call up from the media. You’ll say, “How did Trump do?” “We’re not happy. He didn’t send us enough ventilators.”"
2020-04-06,01:04:36,Donald Trump,"Because that’s called politics, but if you look at what’s happening, and I’m even surprised. The governors are saying all good things, but the Democrat governors and a couple of RINOs, frankly they’re RINOs, that’s all they are. One RINO in particular. But the governors are saying great things. He had a call that lasted two hours today. I heard about that called not just from Mike. It was a perfect call. Now I’m sure you were on the call even though you’re not supposed to be. I’m sure you were on the call, meaning some of the media was on the call because they’re constantly reporting the call. If they’re honest, they will say it was a great call. Okay. Okay, next question, please. Here we go."
2020-04-06,01:05:18,Unnamed,"You didn’t mention the hospitals that were built in New Orleans and Dallas today, but you’ve mentioned that a number of times previously. There seems to be some concern in Texas that they might lose the hospital in Dallas. If it’s not-"
2020-04-06,01:05:32,Donald Trump,We’re never going to do anything that hurts Texas.
2020-04-06,01:05:34,Unnamed,It’s not used yet.
2020-04-06,01:05:35,Donald Trump,"We’re only helping Texas. By the way, the governor is doing a great job over there with this situation, and Texas is so big. You have some parts of the state that are affected. Other parts that aren’t affected at all. It’s an incredible place."
2020-04-06,01:05:47,Unnamed,Can they keep this hospital even if it’s unused or is the federal government going to shift those resources elsewhere?
2020-04-06,01:05:54,Donald Trump,We’re going to use whatever we need and we’re doing it totally in conjunction with the governor. We’re doing it in conjunction with your Texas governor who’s done a fantastic job.
2020-04-06,01:06:05,Unnamed,"Governor Abbot also has a set up checkpoints at the border to check people coming in from Louisiana. We’ve seen checkpoints in Florida, other state borders. Americans-"
2020-04-06,01:06:16,Donald Trump,"Very few people are coming through our border and you’ll be happy to know, we’re up to mile 161 of the wall."
2020-04-06,01:06:23,Unnamed,Internal borders between states.
2020-04-06,01:06:24,Donald Trump,"Oh, I see, okay. But on the border between Mexico, we have 161 miles of wall."
2020-04-06,01:06:29,Unnamed,"I’m talking about internal borders. Americans, they’re not used to seeing border checkpoints between states. How much longer, and is that something that states have to keep [crosstalk 00:32:38]."
2020-04-06,01:06:39,Donald Trump,"First, you want us to call eight governors and tell them to do something, and then you’re complaining that another governor is so strict that he actually checks the borders. I understand why he’s doing that because he knows who he has and he doesn’t want people coming in if they should maybe not be to the liking of the doctors. [crosstalk 01:07:01] No, I think, look, he’s done a great job. He’s done a great job with this case as have many other governors. But he’s done a great job. One of the things I thought you were going to say is we’ve been very tough on our southern border as you know. Very, very tough and part of that’s because of the fact that we have so much… when you talk about 160 miles of new wall, nobody’s coming through that. Nobody, not even close. And we’re building it rapidly. We will have early next year we’ll have close to 500 miles of wall, which is what our goal was."
2020-04-06,01:07:34,Unnamed,You mentioned a Senator Schumer just a moment ago. He had a conference call today and he said that he believes that a COVID Four relief bill will be necessary. Do you share that belief from what would be contained in such a bill?
2020-04-06,01:07:45,Donald Trump,"I don’t know necessarily, but I certainly want to listen, and what I want to do is two things. A real infrastructure, not a green new deal. The carbon footprint. I’m not looking for the carbon footprint. We want to put people to work. And frankly, for so many years, we’ve let our infrastructure go."
2020-04-06,01:08:03,Donald Trump,"Frankly, for so many years, we’ve let our infrastructure go to hell because we were wasting all our money in the Middle East and other places. Okay? I want to rebuild our country. I don’t want to rebuild that. We’re tired. We’ve rebuilt, if you call it that, or destroyed, frankly, what we’ve done is so crazy. What we have done, the direction that this country has taken is so sad, but we’re in the Middle East for $8 trillion, and if you want to fix a pothole in a highway, you can’t do it because they don’t want to give you the funds. So, we want to have an infrastructure bill, a real one like in the vicinity of $2 trillion to completely rebuild our roads, our bridges, our highways, our tunnels, everything. I’m totally open to listening to that. I’m also open to listening to, and even putting forward, because we are going to be putting something forward, more money for our citizens because they’ve gone through a trauma."
2020-04-06,01:08:56,Donald Trump,"This has been trauma. This came out of nowhere. I say it and I’ll say it again, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million people, far more than ever before, and then one day our professionals correctly came to us and they said, “Sorry sir, we have to close down our country.” And I said, “Say it again, say it again.” “We have to close down our country,” and the entire world closed down because of this hidden enemy. Now we are going to take good care of our people. It was not their fault."
2020-04-06,01:09:38,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:09:38] Dr. Birx, to clarify something that she said on Saturday, sir."
2020-04-06,01:09:41,Donald Trump,"Yes, please."
2020-04-06,01:09:42,Unnamed,"May I ask Dr. Birx to clarify something that she said on Saturday? If I may, Dr. Birx, this is a question that comes from a radio colleague of mine, Tamara Keith, and on Saturday it sounded like you said that for the next week people in high risk areas should not even go to the market or the drug store. Is that what you meant to say or is that accurate?"
2020-04-06,01:10:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You know, out of respect for every single health care worker that’s on the front line, whether they’re a nurse, a doctor, a respiratory therapist, the phlebotomist, the persons who come in the rooms to clean, out of respect for them, we as Americans should be doing everything possible. And what I meant was if you can consolidate, if you can send one person, the entire family doesn’t need to go out on these occasions. This is a highly transmittable virus. We’ve been saying that we want every American to know that what they’re doing is making a difference, but we need to have solidarity of commitment from everyone to really, so, maybe once every two weeks we can do a grocery store and pharmacy shop for the entire family. So it was really about we have to do everything we can. I know, I see on the TV stations, the level of human suffering in the hospitals."
2020-04-06,01:11:12,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Dr. Fauci and Admiral Giroir have spent our lives taking care of others. We need to take care of each other now as Americans and do everything that’s in those guidelines. And I know they’re tough. I know incredibly how tough they are. My grandchild of 10 months got a fever of 105 this weekend. I’m the doctor and I couldn’t get there. I mean, so I’m trying to explain to my daughter how to listen to her lungs, how to listen to her lungs, [crosstalk 01:11:43], and then the baby’s lungs."
2020-04-06,01:11:44,Donald Trump,You did not get there.
2020-04-06,01:11:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,I did not go there.
2020-04-06,01:11:46,Donald Trump,"Good, I’m very happy about that."
2020-04-06,01:11:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Because of you two. I mean, you can’t take that kind of risk with the leaders of the country."
2020-04-06,01:11:54,Donald Trump,Your grandson’s okay?
2020-04-06,01:11:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Daughter, but she’s coming out of it."
2020-04-06,01:11:57,Donald Trump,"That’s a lot of temperature, would have thought."
2020-04-06,01:11:58,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yes. But you know, and that’s just an illustration that I know you all are making sacrifices, and I guess I want everyone to take this seriously. So that was really a call of seriousness of how important this is and how we’re starting to see the impact. But you can see what can happen when you come at this a little bit too late, and that’s why the message before you see it, before you have to see your hospitals, and your emergency rooms overwhelmed, it is on us as a member of this community of this country to do everything possible to save one another. And so that was really what I was saying, and I will continue to say that because I do believe it’s making a difference. You can start to see it making a difference, but we have to do even more right now because that will predict where we are two or three weeks from now."
2020-04-06,01:12:53,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Deborah. And it is making a big difference. I saw where Governor Cuomo was a little bit upset today over the weekend, a lot of people outside and they were pretty big groups of people. I saw that. I noticed that and he wasn’t happy with that, and I could understand that. Look, we have a period, a short period of time, hopefully it’s a short period of time to go, and let’s get it done. Let’s get it done. Kristin, did you have a question?"
2020-04-06,01:13:16,Kristen,"Yes, I did. Thank you."
2020-04-06,01:13:16,Donald Trump,You’re so quiet today.
2020-04-06,01:13:18,Kristen,Just got here. Apologies.
2020-04-06,01:13:19,Donald Trump,It’s because you have your own show.
2020-04-06,01:13:21,Kristen,"Yeah, quick follow to the question about legislation. I know there’s discussion about a phase four, but are you also looking seriously at a second round of direct payments, and are you putting discussions on a potential phase four on hold for now while you pursue that?"
2020-04-06,01:13:37,Donald Trump,"Well, I was opposed to the way of money distribution through, as you know, unemployment, and through the state offices, because they have very old, not all of them, but many of them have 40 year old equipment as I’ve said, and it makes it very difficult. But that’s what they want to do. That’s the way it’s mandated to do. I thought it would be better if we did a direct payment system, but the Democrats really wanted it, and I think they had some help from a couple of people that I would have, had I spoken to them, I would have convinced them otherwise, I really believe. But it’s getting out and the federal government has done its job. All we could do is give this massive amount of money to the states. The states then are responsible to distribute it a little bit like we’re talking about here, but the money will be right on time from the federal government."
2020-04-06,01:14:25,Donald Trump,Then the states have to do their job in getting it out.
2020-04-06,01:14:27,Kristen,Is there going to be a second round of those payments?
2020-04-06,01:14:30,Donald Trump,We could very well do a second round of direct. I would do it direct.
2020-04-06,01:14:35,Kristen,Is that under serious discussion?
2020-04-06,01:14:35,Donald Trump,It is absolutely under serious consideration.
2020-04-06,01:14:39,Kristen,"In terms of Chuck Schumer, he also said he spoke to your Chief of Staff about potentially appointing Azar to oversee the supply chain. Is that something that you are considering-"
2020-04-06,01:14:50,Donald Trump,But we have people that are so talented. I know the people he suggested. They’re wonderful people. They worked here. They’re wonderful people. He’s just doing that because it’s politics because you know what-
2020-04-06,01:15:00,Kristen,"Who is the point person right now, Mr. President?"
2020-04-06,01:15:01,Donald Trump,"We have many depending on what. In terms of testing, this gentleman right here. You know who the point person is? This gentleman right here. He’s the one in charge of the task force. But Mike, you may want to tell him about the… Because this is really a military operation."
2020-04-06,01:15:15,Kristen,"Mr. Vice President, in terms of the supply chain-"
2020-04-06,01:15:19,Mike Pence,"Let me answer your first question, if I may, because it’s a very good question, and I spoke to Senator Schumer the night before last about just that. When the President signed a Declaration of National Emergency, he stood up FEMA as the lead agency implementing his policy to marshal a whole of government response. And under FEMA, we provide federal support, the state manages the healthcare response, and healthcare providers and first responders implement that response on a local level."
2020-04-06,01:15:54,Mike Pence,"Our lead on this issue in implementing it is Administrator Pete Gaynor, but the man managing all of the supplies, and you heard a presentation this weekend about our air bridge, what we also call the control tower, we literally, with Admiral John Polowczyk at the helm of our logistics effort, we have visibility now on all the supplies that are moving across this country and into this country from around the world. It really is extraordinary. I mean, when the President tapped FEMA to lead this effort, we essentially wanted to say we want to organize this in a military fashion, and we tapped really someone who is widely regarded as the number one supplies and logistics military officer to do just that."
2020-04-06,01:16:49,Mike Pence,"He really is an extraordinary individual. Admiral Giroir has known him for a long time, and to be working with Admiral Polowczyk, we speak every morning. Our team reviews the data. We go over that with Administrator Gaynor and Admiral Polowczyk. We talk about an extensive team that’s identifying supplies around the country and around the world. And then as we were explaining to governors today, we work with the requests that are coming in from states with a priority on the areas that are dealing with widespread outbreak like the greater New York City area, New Jersey, Louisiana, focus on Detroit, focus on Chicago and Illinois. And then what Pete Gaynor and Admiral Polowczyk are doing is directing those commercial distributors to send the resources directly to the front lines of the battle against the coronavirus."
2020-04-06,01:17:46,Mike Pence,"It is an extraordinary system. And as I explained to the governors today, as I’ve explained to congressional leaders who’ve made what I think is a good faith recommendation, that we organize this in a manner of military logistics, it’s exactly what President Trump has done, and it’s what we’re doing every single day to make sure that healthcare workers, to make sure that the states that are dealing with a widespread outbreak coronavirus, can be confident that we’re going to spare no expense, leave no stone unturned, and use this extraordinary apparatus centered in FEMA to get the people of our country what they need when they need it to battle the coronavirus."
2020-04-06,01:18:30,Donald Trump,"Thank you. And Kristen, when Schumer makes a statement like that, he’s only doing it for politics. He knows. We have the best generals, the best admirals, we have the best people. These are incredible leaders. These are vibrant people. They’ve done such a good job. And again, you’ll get a tape of the conversation, because I’m sure some of the governors probably had their favorite reporter listening to the conversation, even though they weren’t supposed to, but that’s happened before. Just so you understand, we had a call today that was a beautiful call, everybody friendly, everybody happy. They also know in some cases we’ll get them a little bit more, and if they need it, we’ll get them a lot more depending on where this monster is going. But when Schumer does that, [crosstalk 01:19:16] take a look at the past… Well, you’re going to have to tell me who. [crosstalk 01:19:19]"
2020-04-06,01:19:21,Donald Trump,"Well, yeah, some Democrats, because they view this as a campaign issue. They want to make Trump look as bad as they can because they want to try and win an election that they shouldn’t be allowed to win based on the fact that we have done a great job. We built the greatest economy in the world. I’ll do it a second time. We got artificially stopped by a virus that nobody ever thought possible, and we’ve handled it, and we’ve built a team and we’ve built an apparatus that’s been unbelievable. Take a look at the Swine Flu, right? That’s H1N1. Take a look at that, and it’s not the other way around, by the way, it’s H1N1. Take a look. You know what I mean by that. Take a look at the Swine Flu. It was a disaster. 17,000 people died. The other administration, they didn’t even know."
2020-04-06,01:20:07,Donald Trump,"It was like they didn’t even know it was here, and that was peanuts compared to what we have in terms of the power and the magnitude of what we’re going through. This is attacking 182 countries simultaneously. So Schumer’s just all about politics. I’ve known him almost all of my adult life, and he’s a disgrace. In many ways he’s a disgrace, and he knows it’s done. He just wants to do that. But he knows the job we’re doing. Everybody’s amazed at the job we’re doing, and the public is starting to find out. One of the reasons I do these news conferences, because if I didn’t, they would believe fake news, and we can’t let them believe fake news. They see us up here. They see us with admirals. They see us with this talent. They see the job that Mike Pence has done, which has been an unbelievable job, an unbelievable job. I put him there. I thought he’d do well. He did great as the Governor of Indiana, and I thought Mike would do well. He’s done much better than well, and he gets along with people I think much better than I do, because I like people being 100. Mike can put up with things that sometimes I say it’s amazing that he can put up with it, but he’s done an incredible job, and so has the entire team. This is a military operation, and again, we built 2,900 beds in Javits Center. We built medical centers in New York. In Chicago, we built a thousand beds much more now in McCormick Place. That’s their big convention home, the equivalent of Javits, conventional home, big McCormick Place, fantastic place. By the way, the mayor of Chicago, at least on the phone, is extremely happy with what we’re doing, thanking us, has a great relationship with Mike, thanking us, and I just wish the politicians would say to you what they say to us, really, and it’s a good question. Do you have one? Yeah, please."
2020-04-06,01:22:08,Unnamed,"Yes, Mr. President, [crosstalk 01:22:07], an actual security question and then a question about Governor Cuomo. The national security front, to the extent that you can comment on that, your administration is making heavy preparations to move against cartels in Latin America right now, and could you expand-"
2020-04-06,01:22:25,Donald Trump,You said Latin America?
2020-04-06,01:22:26,Unnamed,Yes. Could you expand on the reasoning of why now? Are their supply and logistics especially weak? Is it political? What’s the reasoning?
2020-04-06,01:22:32,Donald Trump,"It’s a good question. We’ve moved a tremendous number of boats and ships to the area of, different areas of exactly where you’re talking about, because we’re tired of drugs pouring into our country from other places, and we’re tired of seeing drugs pouring into different parts of Latin America, South America, and just coming into our country. Now we’ve got them stopped at the border and they’re trying to do it by sea. So we stop them at the border with, and frankly with the help of Mexico. Mexico right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. They never had any soldiers. They’re doing that because I’ve asked them to do it. That’s the only reason they’re doing it. They have 27,000 soldiers. So now they’re trying to bring it in by boat and by ship, the drug Lords and the people doing drugs, and trying to destroy our country from inside with drugs, and we’re hitting them very, very hard, and that’s why we’re doing it."
2020-04-06,01:23:28,Unnamed,Are there illicit activities that U.S. assets are targeting?
2020-04-06,01:23:30,Donald Trump,Say it.
2020-04-06,01:23:31,Unnamed,Is it beyond narcotics? Are there other illicit activities [crosstalk 01:23:34]?
2020-04-06,01:23:34,Donald Trump,"Well, there are the activities of human trafficking, and especially with respect to women, and as you know, proportionally, it’s mostly women, and it’s a horrible thing. [crosstalk 01:23:46] It’s a horrible thing and there’s never been a time like it, and it’s because of the internet, and this is all over the world. But for the most part they’re coming through, in this country. they’re coming through the southern border, but we’re hitting them very hard. They have tremendous illegal trafficking in women and children also, but mostly in women. And it’s illegal, and it’s horrible, and it’s disgraceful, and I’ve seen things that are an absolute disgrace, and we’re trying to knock them out and we’re knocking them hard. And again, I want to thank the President of Mexico because he has really stepped up to the plate, 27,000 soldiers. They’ve never had any soldiers at our border, and I did that because the Democrats will not approve anything to stop because they want to have open borders."
2020-04-06,01:24:31,Donald Trump,"They want to have all these people flowing through our border and in many cases they’re sick. They have problems that you don’t want to know about, or they’re criminals in many cases, not in all cases, but in many cases. They want to have open borders. They want to have sanctuary cities, so they protect criminals, and I don’t want to have it, and Joe Biden does want to have that also, as you know, because he said that during numerous debates. I want to have strong borders and I don’t like protecting criminals with sanctuary cities, but we’re doing it for drugs, we’re doing it for human trafficking, we’re doing it because you have to do it. We either have borders or we don’t have a country. [crosstalk 01:25:11] All right. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-06,01:25:12,Unnamed,"Mr. President, on the question of antibody testing which is FDA approved now but not widely available yet. I know the Admiral said by May you expect to have millions available. How are we going to prioritize who’s going to get the antibody tests, and what is that going to show you? Do you think that’s going to be immunity?"
2020-04-06,01:25:29,Donald Trump,I have an answer but I’d rather have the Admiral answer that.
2020-04-06,01:25:32,Brett Giroir,"So, let me clarify, and I know you probably understand this, is the antibody test does not tell you if you have the active virus in your nose. If you are positive for the antibody, it strongly implies, it means that you have had the virus before, and to the degree that we know of medical knowledge, you will probably highly probably be protected against getting the virus again in the future."
2020-04-06,01:25:57,Brett Giroir,"So I want to make something clear. There’s no antibody test approved. Okay? Approved is not a word we talk about. There is a test or two that has received emergency use authorization, and many, many, many others out there that have not gone that way yet, and I want to take this opportunity to caution. There is a very consolidated effort between the FDA, CDC, NIH, to validate some of the tests that are on the market right now, because it is very important that they actually do what they say they do, and we have reason to believe that not all of them are going to perform well. I don’t know the primary source, but the Financial Times just reported that the UK had 17.5 million antibody tests that they bought and none of them work."
2020-04-06,01:26:45,Brett Giroir,"So we’re not going to get in that situation. We’re going to be very careful to make sure that when we tell you you’re likely immune from the disease, that test really said that. Now I will also make a statement, and there’s a lot of work on here and I’m very excited about it, as opposed to the test for a novel virus, the antibody type tests are very sophisticated technology, but they’re old technology. This, we expect to have many tens of millions of tests the first month that we are really sure that the test makes sense. So, this allows for surveillance screening, and Dr. Birx is one of the world experts to understand, is 1%, 5%, 20% of Americans have been infected, but it also allows us to have very widespread tens and tens of millions of people screened with a finger prick on the spot."
2020-04-06,01:27:39,Unnamed,"And by when, by May you are saying this will happen?"
2020-04-06,01:27:43,Brett Giroir,"So, science doesn’t run on rails, right? So you need to make sure that the FDA, the NIH, which they’re actively doing right now, assure that the tests that they’re testing really do perform the way they should. And if things work out the way we believe they will, we will have millions on the market by May in a sophisticated way, in a prospective way, that we get the surveillance we need, we can test people to see if they’ve been exposed, immune, and go back to work, and a combination of that kind of test with the current kind of test we have now is how America opens back up."
2020-04-06,01:28:20,Unnamed,"And how will you prioritize Who gets those tests? I mean, tens of million, we’re a country of 300 million, how do you determine who you’re going to have have that test?"
2020-04-06,01:28:25,Brett Giroir,"Well, we are having active discussions under the leadership of Dr. Birx and the task force, but you can imagine how that is, right, but with tens and tens and tens of millions of tests per month that are available, you could really do very widespread testing, but let me just give you an example."
2020-04-06,01:28:41,Donald Trump,"Which nobody else can do, by the way. No other country can do."
2020-04-06,01:28:44,Donald Trump,"I’ll just give you one example. It would be very important to know if the virus is still circulating here, whether for example a healthcare worker, or a longterm care nursing home worker is immune from the virus and can’t carry it. Very, very important to protect our elderly in that situation. But also if you haven’t been exposed to make sure that you really take precautions, and maybe take care of the people who don’t have the virus and you don’t have the virus. So it’s complex, but it’s not complicated on how you go about looking this in different segments of society. And I don’t want to take too much more time with the podium, but antibody tests are a different thing. They’re coming. We’re highly confident that this can be scaled very rapidly and provide us a bit of information we just don’t have now."
2020-04-06,01:29:30,Donald Trump,"[inaudible 00:21:31], be a bad week."
2020-04-06,01:29:35,Unnamed,Does that mean-
2020-04-06,01:29:36,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I’m going to look into it. And I also think our Navy Secretary is a highly respected man. So sometimes that happens with people and I’ll take a look at it."
2020-04-06,01:29:47,Unnamed,What do you mean by that? Would you consider reinstating him?
2020-04-06,01:29:50,Donald Trump,"When he sends a letter out and he sends copies all over the place and it’s not a classified letter, and it was very disconcerting to the families of the people on the, very disconcerting, so number one, they get worried and scared. It was weak. We don’t want weak, but I’m going to take a look because I think he looks to me like he’s an outstanding guy. I looked at his whole, just a little while ago, I looked at his file, and people have bad days and we’ll take a look at it."
2020-04-06,01:30:25,Unnamed,I guess my question is what would you consider doing for him?
2020-04-06,01:30:27,Donald Trump,"Well, we’ll take a look. I want to look. I want to speak also to the Secretary. I also want to speak to the Secretary of Defense, who is Mark Esper, who’s doing a fantastic job, and maybe I can help the situation out. I mean, you guys are saying why is the President getting involved and going, well, I like to solve problems. It’s a problem. I don’t want to see men hurt, women hurt, I don’t want to see people hurt unnecessarily. Maybe we can solve it easily where it’s not life changing. But he did, he did a bad thing. Sending a letter out and many, many copies, as you know. I don’t know. I heard 28 copies. I heard a lot. That’s a lot of copies. Plus, the letter was five pages long. I haven’t read the letter, but I think it was five pages long, single spaced. That’s a lot of writing. He’s the captain of a ship. He’s a very important person of a very expensive ship, a nuclear powered ship. He shouldn’t be writing letters like that, but it happens. Sometimes I’ll write a letter that I say, ” I wish I didn’t send it.” Not too often, but it happens. [crosstalk 01:31:34] Go ahead. Yes."
2020-04-06,01:31:37,Kristen,"If you could follow up on that, because the Acting Navy Secretary, I mean, I know you were asked, but I just want to try one more time. He did say in remarks to soldiers on the USS Roosevelt that Crozier was, “Too naive or too stupid to be in command if he didn’t think that writing that letter was a bad thing.”"
2020-04-06,01:31:52,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t want to comment on what he said. I understand."
2020-04-06,01:31:54,Kristen,"Could he have used different language, Mr. President?"
2020-04-06,01:31:55,Donald Trump,"It’s tough language, but let’s not get into that. It’s tough language. Now there are some people that think, “Oh wow. He says it like it is.” Look, he made a mistake. He should not have sent that letter, or he should’ve gone through his chain of command, which is the typical way of doing it. He’s in the military. He’s a very important person in the military. He knows it better than anybody in this room, what he should’ve done, and I’m sure he feels he made a mistake, but I’m going to look into it, and I’m going to see, maybe we can do something because I’m not looking to destroy a person’s life who’s had an otherwise stellar career as I understand it. I looked at this file just now because I’ve been seeing what’s going on. If we can save a person’s career…"
2020-04-06,01:32:42,Donald Trump,"I don’t mind going after a person that they did something wrong, but this was a mistake. He made a mistake. I’m not justifying what he did. He made a mistake. Shouldn’t be sending letters. He’s the captain. He’s a very important person in the military. You don’t send letters and then it leaks into a newspaper, of all newspapers, that was a beauty, right? So you just don’t do that. So it was a mistake, but I may get involved. I’ll call Secretary of Defense and find out a little bit about it, and if I can help two people, two good people, I’m going to help them."
2020-04-06,01:33:14,Unnamed,"Mr. President, your tone seems to have changed a little bit-"
2020-04-06,01:33:18,Donald Trump,Say it.
2020-04-06,01:33:18,Unnamed,Your tone seems to changed a little bit on the captain.
2020-04-06,01:33:22,Donald Trump,With the captain?
2020-04-06,01:33:22,Unnamed,Yeah. Was it the news coverage or did somebody to on his behalf?
2020-04-06,01:33:26,Donald Trump,"I said, when you asked me, and when the question was asked the last time, I said, “He shouldn’t have sent the letter.: I haven’t changed. He should not have sent a letter. And if there’s a letter, it should go classified and it should go to his superior, and he shouldn’t be jumping off the superior. [crosstalk 01:33:39] It hasn’t changed in that regard. The only thing that has played right up here with me is that I looked at his record and he’s been an outstanding person. If he wasn’t, I wouldn’t even be talking about this. He’s been an outstanding person. He’s had a very exemplary military career. I mean, he started off as a helicopter pilot. They called him Chopper. His name was Chopper. He was a great helicopter pilot. It’s a tremendous skill. I know a lot about helicopters. And then he went F-16s or F-18s and he was a tremendous pilot."
2020-04-06,01:34:15,Donald Trump,"And then he’s very smart. He studied nuclear energy and he was fantastic, and very few people have the aptitude, they have the mentality to do that. Nuclear energy is very complex. It’s very hard. Very few people can do it. And he did it well, and then it became the captain of a nuclear ship, right, replacement cost, if you look at replacement cost, $18 billion are replacement costs, right? So he’s got, on a replacement cost basis, an $18 billion ship. You know the President Gerald Ford, very expensive, that’s the nearest thing I can think of, but they’re spending money on that one like nobody’s ever seen. So he made a mistake. He made a mistake, and maybe we’re going to make that mistake, not destroy his life. Okay, a couple of more. [crosstalk 01:35:08] Go ahead."
2020-04-06,01:35:09,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you mentioned medical professionals. You compared them to soldiers going onto the battlefield. Many doctors and medical workers today, some that see pay cuts. They’re going into a sort environment where they’re concerned about their own health, their family’s livelihood. If something were to happen to them-"
2020-04-06,01:35:25,Donald Trump,Very much in my mind.
2020-04-06,01:35:26,Unnamed,As part of this phase four are you going to prioritize?
2020-04-06,01:35:28,Donald Trump,"There doesn’t have to be a phase four. I think it could be a separate phase when it’s all over. Right now, I don’t think they want to think of it. These people don’t want to think about. These people are incredible. They’re not thinking about how much am I getting paid? These people are incredible. I’ve seen it. I see their spirit. I hear about it all the time from Mike, from the Admiral, I hear about it all the time. These people are incredible. When it’s all over, I do want to seriously think, maybe in the form of bonuses. These people are, what they’ve done is incredible. I just admire the attitude and I’ve said it. They walk into those hospitals and they are seriously, you know, one of the things that came up with the Comfort, the ship, is that when we fulfill the request of Governor Cuomo and Governor Murphy, and they’re going to be splitting up, but a lot of things happen to ships when you do that."
2020-04-06,01:36:22,Donald Trump,"They didn’t want to do this. In fact, they specifically didn’t want to do this, have patients that were affected with this horrible disease, or whatever the plague, because frankly it’s a plague. That’s exactly what it is. You’d read about it in the old days, the plague, and that’s exactly what it is. But we’re doing it. But when I see the bravery of these people walking through doors without their stuff, they’re not standing outside, “Hey, let’s get ready.” They’re running through doors putting on the stuff. It’s not even on. I think it’s incredible. I’m telling you, the nearest thing I can think of is soldiers in battle, and soldiers going right into battle, because that’s what they’re doing. It’s really, in many ways, it’s the same thing. All right. How about one more?"
2020-04-06,01:37:10,Unnamed,"Mr. President, [inaudible 01:37:11] question, Mr. President, you may have seen this. The Masters Tournament has been rescheduled to November. Two questions, A, is that an outgrowth of your conversation that you had with sports commissioners on Saturday?"
2020-04-06,01:37:22,Donald Trump,"I hope it’s rescheduled. I hope football is able to start. I hope baseball can get to play a little bit. I hope basketball can maybe do their playoffs. I mean, hey, I have no interests or anything other than I want what’s good for the country."
2020-04-06,01:37:35,Unnamed,What about the U.S. Open which you have attended many times?
2020-04-06,01:37:38,Donald Trump,"A lot of people are tired of looking at games that are five years old. I looked the other day, I saw somebody, I said, “Wow, he looks great.” I forgot. I said, “Oh, that was nine years ago.” I said, “He’s really in great shape.” Well, not in great shape now, but he was in great shape then. It was nine years ago. You get tired of looking at nine year old baseball games and playoff games that took place 12 years ago. I don’t have much time to do that, frankly, but that’s what people are doing, and they want to see sports. Sports are a great thing for this country and I hope football can start, and I told them, I think you might be able to. They may very well be able to. I hope they can start and I hope they can start with people in the stands."
2020-04-06,01:38:14,Donald Trump,"You know, we’re not going to be separated. You have seats. Those seats are meant for people to sit next to each other, and when this virus is gone, people are going to be sitting next to each other, and just for the restaurant industry so they understand, when the virus is gone, people are going to be sitting next to each other. One man said, “I have a 200 seat restaurant. It’s been great. But if I go by these rules, those 200 seats goes down to 60.” I said, “No, no. You have a 200 seat restaurant. That’s what you have.” But we have to wait until the virus goes away. It wouldn’t even do well at 60. Frankly, there’s a warmth to it also. There’s a warmth. But not when we have the virus in the air."
2020-04-06,01:38:54,Donald Trump,"Well ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I’m going to let our Vice President take over. He’s got some really interesting numbers, statistics, and I want to thank the Admiral. I want to thank Tony and Deborah and everybody else. I want to thank everybody that’s working, and I really do, I see a lot of tremendous things happen. The therapeutics, the call I had today was one of the most exciting calls I’ve had in a long time. And again, I want to wish my best to the UK and the family of Boris Johnson, and we just hope he’s going to be okay because he’s a fine guy. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you."
2020-04-06,01:39:35,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. A few updates on the activity of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, then I’m going to ask a Dr. Birx to speak about what we’re seeing in the numbers. We know we are at the beginning of what’s going to be a very tough week in America, but as Dr. Birx will reflect, because the American people have been embracing social distancing, putting into practice the advice of state and local leaders, and the President’s coronavirus guidelines, are for our country. As Dr. Birx will describe, we are not only seeing remarkable progress in Washington state, and in California, where the numbers remain low and steady, that’s a great tribute to the people of both of those states, and to all of their dedicated healthcare workers, but we’re also beginning, we’re beginning to see a leveling, and just at the very beginning, and she’ll reflect on those in just a few moments."
2020-04-06,01:40:46,Mike Pence,"A couple of quick updates. At the present moment, the President has approved 50 major disaster declarations, and will likely be issuing a disaster declaration for the state of Minnesota before the end of the day. We’ve distributed more than $4.1 billion to states, and right after our incredible healthcare workers, we couldn’t be more proud of more than 21,000 National Guard that have been activated and are working in states all across the country."
2020-04-06,01:41:17,Mike Pence,"During my conference call today, I learned that Governor Brian Kemp is actually using the Georgia National Guard to sanitize and clean up nursing homes. But National Guard are being deployed in a variety of ways all across the country, and to them and to the families of all these citizen soldiers, you have our admiration and our respect."
2020-04-06,01:41:41,Mike Pence,"As the President mentioned, our focus remains on the New York metro area, New Jersey, Louisiana, and then Michigan and Illinois. We’re watching every area of the country, but those are the priorities today. And in that spirit, I spoke today, as the President did with Governor Cuomo of New York. The President made the-"
2020-04-06,01:42:03,Mike Pence,"Did with the Governor Cuomo of New York. The president made the decision to open up the USNS Comfort to COVID patients and he also informed the governor of New Jersey that we would be taking New Jersey COVID patients. So now there will be two facilities, one of the Javits Center that’s all COVID and the USNS Comfort that we’ll be managing COVID patients."
2020-04-06,01:42:26,Mike Pence,"At the present moment there… by this evening, there will be a 2,179 medical military personnel in New York city, and over the next two days, that number will rise to 3,000. Speaking with the governor, speaking with Mayor de Blasio, the president and I were informed that while we have surged ventilators, we have surged personal protective equipment, that sending in some relief for healthcare workers was vitally important. And so again, I want to emphasize that those are medical personnel, doctors and nurses and medical assistants who are on the scene now and will continue to arrive to a total number of 3,000."
2020-04-06,01:43:16,Mike Pence,"I spoke to Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey. New Jersey is very much in the forefront of the coronavirus in America today. We want to commend the governor for his extraordinary leadership in the state. During our briefing today, we learned about the progress that they were making and also about the governor’s decision to temporarily reactivate retired healthcare personnel in the state. And just as a reminder of all that we’re dealing with, this weekend, Governor Murphy told me that New Jersey surpassed the number of lives that were lost on September 11th to the state of New Jersey, and it breaks our heart to think of that and our hearts go out to all of the families of the more than 10,000 Americans who have succumbed to the coronavirus."
2020-04-06,01:44:13,Mike Pence,"We also, as the president said, we express our gratitude to governors in Oregon and Washington state yesterday for donating ventilators to help the states at the epicenter of the coronavirus. Governor Gavin Newsom of California donated 500 ventilators and I just learned that those will be going… 200 to the state of Maryland, 50 to the district of Columbia, 100 to the state of Delaware, 100 to Nevada, and we’ll also be deploying the remaining 50 to the Northern Marianas Islands and to Guam. And we want thank Governor Gavin Newsom. The state of California has provided extraordinary and compassionate leadership for their citizens. They’re making progress. They’re as the governor said the other day, they’re not out of the woods yet, but the numbers speak for themselves and the generosity of the people of California and the governor is gratefully received."
2020-04-06,01:45:18,Mike Pence,"Beyond that before I recognize that Dr. Birx, let me just say that at the beginning of this challenging time, we want to challenge every American to continue to do what every American can do and clearly what we see in Washington and California and what we are just beginning to see elsewhere is put into practice the social distancing recommendations of the coronavirus guidelines for America. Listen to your state and local authorities. We really do believe that while this will be a week of heartache, it also is a week of hope and as we see some of the cases beginning to level just for a day or two, it is our hope that what we have seen begin in the greater New York area and even in Louisiana and elsewhere will become a trend, but it only becomes a trend if every one of us continues to take ownership and continues to do our part for this 30 days to slow the spread."
2020-04-06,01:46:31,Mike Pence,"With that, I’ll recognize Dr. Birx for the latest data and then we’ll take questions."
2020-04-06,01:46:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr. Vice President. I think you heard very clearly our concern in the New York, New Jersey metro areas. This is also includes Connecticut and Long Island. As we talked about, we did see a significant increase in Sussex County over the weekend. The weekend numbers are always difficult. I want to be clear on that because sometimes case reporting is not as accurate over the weekend, so we’ll be watching very closely today’s numbers and Tuesdays numbers. Also very of course focused on the New Orleans metro area and that includes the three parishes of Jefferson, St. John’s the Baptist and New Orleans Proper and of course the Detroit area, which is Oakland and Wayne."
2020-04-06,01:47:22,Dr. Deborah Birx,"As we mentioned before, we’re continuing to track very closely out of concerns of it potentially reaching logarithmic phase in the Chicago metro area, the Boston metro area, the DC and Baltimore metro area, Indianapolis, the Denver area and two regions of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and the Pittsburgh area, as well as Dallas and Houston in the Texas area."
2020-04-06,01:47:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I had a very encouraging call, because we also don’t want to miss anything. Remember I showed you a lot of states were very much under 25 and 50 cases for 100,000. There were a few standouts that we were concerned about, which was Vermont, New Hampshire, Idaho and Montana. We had excellent calls today with their health commissioners and they’re really were able. They’re on top of the situation. These were micro outbreaks that occurred due to ski events and weddings and nursing homes. And they were able to describe and critical detail the incidents and how they’re tracking and tracing. They are still doing full contact tracing through those areas."
2020-04-06,01:48:31,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And I just want to applaud these… both a rural and metro problem and I really want to applaud how many of the states that may have smaller populations are approaching this. That gives us encouragement of how we can talk about beginning surveillance activities. At the same time, we’re following these very clear outbreaks and ensuring that there’s full supplies based on the very granular data that we’re utilizing. And I just want to thank the mayors and governors who get us that granular data and allows us to make these deep interpretation across all of United States. We know each governor is concerned about their areas, but these metro areas cover different areas. So the Philadelphia area also includes Southern New Jersey and Delaware. And so we have to really look at things very much as both the metro and the communities that surround those metros. And so all of those people, we ask you again throughout the United States to follow these very clear guidance."
2020-04-06,01:49:31,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I want to just recognize both HHS and you heard about the work that Admiral Giroir is doing, the work that Dr. Hahn and Administrator Seema Verma are doing and also Administrator Engels in the work of HRSA to really ensure that our federally funded clinics are actively engaged in all of these aspects."
2020-04-06,01:49:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But I also want to recognize the military, the medical corps, the nursing corps and the medical subspecialty core. These were my brothers and sisters for 29 years. It is highly unusual for the active force to be called into a domestic situation. I think that shows you how seriously we’re taking this at the federal government level. In my 29 years in the military, I was never deployed domestically. This is showing you how serious of an event we take this. If the military is deploying domestically, it is another reason for every American to be following these guidelines."
2020-04-06,01:50:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Finally, on CDC quietly launched a new website. It’s you go to cdc.gov and you go to COVID-19 you can find their surveillance data. This surveillance data is bringing together our influenza like illnesses with their syndromic management databases so that you can track the respiratory disease across the United States. The states are used to using this system. It’s in emergency rooms, it’s in hospitals, it’s in doctor’s offices, and it gives you insight and you can see very clearly influenza A peak. You can see the influenza B peak and now you can start to see the respiratory disease from this current outbreak. These are the systems that exist within the United States that will be strengthened in order for us to do comprehensive surveillance."
2020-04-06,01:51:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I just want to assure the American people while we’re working on these outbreaks, we’re also working on bringing new systems together that have a comprehensive look across the country, building on the strong work of CDC as a public health institution so that we can work county by county, community by community, state by state to really understand where this virus is and where it will be, but also as an early alert for us in the future. I want just want to assure the American people that as we’re working on the crisis of today, we’re looking to the future to ensure we have the systems in place to bring those early alert systems together while we work on the antibody testing and why we work on continuing spreading and increasing the diagnostic capabilities that you see presented here. Thank you."
2020-04-06,01:52:11,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Deb. And it was Rob spoke several times when the president was with us, so he’ll be here for questions as Deborah Birx will, but Dr. Fauci, your thoughts and then we’ll take some questions."
2020-04-06,01:52:26,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, no, actually I just wanted to… okay. I will. It related to the… something I said yesterday about that’s somewhat paradox of everything going up at the same time that the feeding into this engine of this virus is starting to show some signs."
2020-04-06,01:52:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Governor Cuomo today reported an interesting data from New York, namely that the number of hospitalizations, the number of admissions to intensive care, and the number of requirements for intubations over the last three days have actually started to level off. Again, everybody who knows me knows I’m very conservative about making projections, but those are the kind of good signs that you look for. You never even begin to think about claiming victory prematurely. But that’s the first thing you see when you start to see the turnaround. That doesn’t mean we don’t have a lot of work to do. That tells me instead of saying, “Hmm, that’s pretty good,” it’s we got there through mitigation. We cut off the stream of people who ultimately required hospitalization, required intubation, required all of the kinds of extreme methods."
2020-04-06,01:53:38,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"We just got to realize that this is an indication despite all the suffering and the death that has occurred, that what we have been doing has been working. The call that I say every time I get to this podium is just it up, because this is going to get us out of it. This is our best and only great public health tool."
2020-04-06,01:53:59,Jonathan Karl,Are we starting to see that across many states? We’re seeing the level of hospitalizations and deaths is lower than what we anticipated?
2020-04-06,01:54:10,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You’re going to see it most dramatically, John, in a place like New York where you see it goes up and peak and then it will hopefully, and I think it will come down. When you have places like Seattle, which did a… and Washington state who did a really good job from the beginning, it never really did that so they were able to keep it down and on the charts that Dr. Birx showed when you saw California and Washington state, they were fortunate. They did a good job, that it never really got out of hand. Again, this is a big country and you have a number of different metropolitan areas. I think if we do it right, you’re going to see those who have not peaked, will not peak and those who have peaked, the New Orleans, the New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Detroit and others. You’re going to see the same thing if we keep our foot on the accelerator."
2020-04-06,01:55:05,Jonathan Karl,Okay. Gotcha.
2020-04-06,01:55:05,Mike Pence,Thanks John. Are there questions for the team?
2020-04-06,01:55:08,Jeff (Reporter),"Follow up to Dr. Fauci’s comment about what it’s like going to be coming back normal and until there was a vaccine that there’ll be gradual steps towards the sort of normalcy. Under that, short of a vaccine, does putting 80,000 people fans, spectators in a sports stadium or 25,000 politicos in a indoor arena for a political convention this summer make a lot of sense? Or does those sorts of things require a vaccine to fully protecting the American populates."
2020-04-06,01:55:33,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I don’t think that you’re going to have to say that the country cannot get back to a real degree of normalcy until you absolutely have a safe and effective vaccine. It will be really evaluating the kinds of things and that’s the reason why it was discussed up here, why it’s so important to have an antibody test so you know what the penetrance is in society. And then we have a situation where we don’t ever want to get to have to mitigate. We wanted to be able to contain, and by the time we have to face what’s going to happen with this going back to normality, we will have in place the capability of identifying, isolating, contact tracing so that it never gets out of hand. Ultimately, the show stopper will be, obviously, a vaccine where you can vaccinate people and you won’t have it."
2020-04-06,01:56:28,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"There’s going to be another issue that’s going to be important and it has to do with somewhat of a comparison. For example, with influenza, we go through multiple cycles of influenza. There’s always a degree of background immunity in the population. I mean that will ultimately happen if we get a situation where we get back to normal. Now, I hope we don’t have so people infected that we actually have that herd immunity. But I think it would have to be different than it is right now. So again, remember when you say normalcy, I mean we could give back normally, economically and otherwise without necessarily saying we’re going to forget about the virus. We have to pay attention to this because we’ve had a very bad experience with this virus."
2020-04-06,01:57:15,Unnamed,"Thank you. And this is for the vice president, for Dr. Birx And Dr. Fauci, but can you give us a sense of, and I know you don’t want to make any projections, but where we are with the numbers, because we saw that horrible number today, more than 10,000 deaths now in the US. Are we on track for the those best case scenario numbers that you had laid out, the 100,000 or are we potentially coming in lower than that at this point given some of what you’re seeing?"
2020-04-06,01:57:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,It just gives me an opportunity to thank and respect the modelers who have really worked on this because there’s a large number of them have worked very hard and had done a lot of predictions and what we did is we did predictions of predictions. We like to integrate data and so that’s where you come up with these numbers.
2020-04-06,01:58:01,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think Dr. Fauci and I both strongly believe that if we work as hard as we can over the next several weeks that we will see potential to go under the numbers that were predicted by the models. And I think that is really two things. It is the extraordinary compliance of the American people and the diligence that they have mitigated with, because remember we are doing this strictly by behavior change. It’s very hard to change trajectory of viruses on just behavior change. We have had difficulty in our past doing that. That’s what we’re doing and that’s what the American people are doing. But the other side of that is the incredible insights that Washington state and others are providing on how to better care for the patients in the hospital. And so those two pieces are coming together that could have a dramatic impact on the predictions of the mortality from this disease."
2020-04-06,01:59:00,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I’m glad you asked that question because I’ve said it a couple of times here. I want to say it again. Repetition is good… is that models are good. They help us to make projections. But as you get data in, you modify your model. And I’ve always said data always trumps models, always."
2020-04-06,01:59:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What I feel, and I believe that Dr. Birx also feels, that I don’t think anyone has ever mitigated the way I’m seeing people mitigate right now. This has never happened in this country before. I am optimistic, always cautiously optimistic, that if we do what I’ve been talking about over the past few minutes, we can make that number go down. I don’t accept every day that we’re going to have to have 100 to 200,000 deaths. I think we can really bring that down no matter what a model says, because when the data comes in, they’ll start to saying, “Maybe you are essentially overshooting the model.” And I think that’s where we can go. That’s the reason why I like to always get up and tell the American people, it’s the virus doing what the virus wants to do and it’s we as a society doing what we can do."
2020-04-06,02:00:16,Mike Pence,"And let me just amplify that from a lay person’s perspective. The American people are doing it. I mean, the initial data, what we’ve seen in California and Washington support fact that the American people are doing these things, which is nothing short of loving your neighbor. I mean the truth is the threat of serious illness for most Americans is relatively low. But the threat of serious illness for seniors with underlying health conditions or anyone with an immunodeficiency is very high. And when we see Americans putting these principles into practice the way you all have been, it really means you’re considering others more important than yourself. And I have to tell you, for the president, for me, for all of us, it’s deeply inspiring. We just need to continue to do it for all of these 30 days and we’ll bring that number down. How about a couple more? Please."
2020-04-06,02:01:27,Unnamed,Mr. Vice President. When will you know… when do you think that you will know whether or not you will have to extend those 30 day guidelines or if 30 days will be enough?
2020-04-06,02:01:39,Mike Pence,"Well, the experts told us that somewhere around the middle of this month would be the peak. And as we begin to see a couple of days, but that might be the beginning of leveling. We’re going to watch that carefully and we’re going to bring that information to the president. But for now the decision is, and the request of every American is to continue to put into practice all of the president’s coronavirus guidelines, 30 days to slow the spread and for all of you in areas that have been impacted broadly by the coronavirus, listen to what your state and local authorities are asking you to do. It will protect your health, your family’s health, and it will save lives. Let’s do a couple more and a for our panel if you’d like. Jeff,"
2020-04-06,02:02:32,Jeff (Reporter),"It’s more of a personal question, but Dr. Birx, can you tell us if your granddaughter’s okay?"
2020-04-06,02:02:36,Mike Pence,"Yeah, I’d like to know too."
2020-04-06,02:02:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, thank you. Due to her… the great care of my 91 year old nurse mother and my daughter, she’s down to like 100 to 99 now, but it was three days of 104, 105 which is… babies can do that. But it’s very scary, especially when I couldn’t assure myself that she was fine. It was just some sleepless nights for me and them as they kept her fever down. Thank you for asking."
2020-04-06,02:03:06,Jeff (Reporter),Is it the virus?
2020-04-06,02:03:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"No, I’m sure it’s roseola or something. They have not been out of the house. They are not allowed out of the house. They’ve got two granddaughters under… one, 2-1/2 almost and one only 10 months and my 91 year old and 96 year old. So no one is allowed in that house or out of that house because there’s too much precious cargo inside the house."
2020-04-06,02:03:34,Mike Pence,How about one more question. We’ll let go.
2020-04-06,02:03:36,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, for whoever wants to answer this. It’s a technical question. FEMA says that it is in the process of distributing 90% of each states allocated supplies from the National Strategic Stockpile and that allocation is determined based on population by the last census in each state and the other 10% it says is going to frontline healthcare workers serving in the federal response efforts. Where are those healthcare workers in the federal response and do you envision a scenario in which you could start giving states more supplies from the National Strategic Stockpile?"
2020-04-06,02:04:14,Mike Pence,"It’s a really good question and let me say the Strategic National Stockpile, and I’m going to have Admiral Giroir to speak about his piece of that, it has been largely deployed. We are continuing to replenish it in part with a small portion of what’s coming in from around the world. You’ve heard about our air bridge, now more than 50 flights that have been scheduled that are bringing millions of supplies into the United States. What we’re doing is taking less than 10% of that, put it into the Strategic National Stockpile so we have that to basically provide for states on an as needed basis. But the other 90%, that system that I just described earlier when the president was here, is working with the six major medical distributors in the country to deploy those resources to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, Illinois, the exact priority that you just heard Dr. Birx describe and that the data informs and those decisions are being made every single day."
2020-04-06,02:05:29,Mike Pence,"And so while, well, if a hurricane hits Florida or tornadoes or flooding tear through the state of Indiana, we’re very accustomed to FEMA coming in, drawing from the National Stockpile, providing specific resources. In this case with a nationwide effort, what President Trump directed us to do was literally marshal the resources of the full economy to be able to make sure that we can meet the needs for personal protective equipment, ventilators and all manner of supplies. And we’re doing that in a small way through the Strategic National Stockpile, but in the largest way through that control tower system that Admiral John Polowczyk is running for us, that is deploying those resources and making sure they’re going straight to where they need to go."
2020-04-06,02:06:28,Mike Pence,"And as I said earlier, those decisions are being informed by the data and they’re literally being made by our team at FEMA on a daily and sometimes hourly basis. And we’ll continue to keep you informed as we did today about where some of those are going. But let me let Admiral Giroir finish that answer."
2020-04-06,02:06:46,Brett Giroir,"I don’t really have much more to add to that. The vice president is certainly well-informed about that and I want to assure you that all the sourcing around the world, if it’s there, we’re putting it in our supply chains. We’re buying more. Manufacturers are stepping up to the plate and this is going not just by percent allocation, but it’s going to the exact places that need it, in the quantities that they need to take care of patients."
2020-04-06,02:07:11,Brett Giroir,"And we want to make sure this is a two way street. We get the data in from individual hospitals to know exactly what their burn rate is, exactly what they need and we want to make sure that they feel comfortable that they’re going to have supplies because they will, because part of this is about potential shortages other place, some places, most of it’s about a fear of a shortage. If I’m a physician in an ICU and I’m not sure that it’s going to be there, that’s going to scare me, it’s going to scare my nurses. We want everyone to have that assurance that we will provide you what you need over a week’s periods of time exactly to your need."
2020-04-06,02:07:47,Brett Giroir,"And Admiral Polowczyk and his team, and again, it’s all military in there. I mean he is the logistics guy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, right. This is what he does. He is a wizard. He has a… there are more stars around me in the DOD part of the military than I’ve generally seen outside of the Pentagon. This is really being run as a military operation. I’m in the US Public Health Service, so we’re part of HHS. The surgeon general, and I have the honor of running that service. We are shoulder to shoulder in the field, in the military hospitals with everyone else. There are only 6,100 of us. 3,000 are doing direct patient care on a daily basis. We take care of the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Prisons, those in detention at the border, et cetera. That’s what we do. The other 3, 000, over 2,000 of those are in the field already taking care of patients directly and we have more going out the door every day."
2020-04-06,02:08:36,Unnamed,"And if I could just follow up on that very quickly then, is it even worth then governors writing into FEMA, if they’ve already received their 90% allocation and you’re getting data directly from the hospitals to ask for more at this point?"
2020-04-06,02:08:50,Brett Giroir,"This has been a very cooperative interaction. I bet I talk to five governors a day and we talk out the issues and understand what they perceive in their state. They often help us… help point us to particular areas that may… that they feel need more attention or there needs more communication. It’s been very productive. I have to look up what governor goes to what state because I’m not… that’s not my world, but it’s been a very productive interaction."
2020-04-06,02:09:20,Brett Giroir,"I think all of this is necessary. I’m on almost every governor’s call with the vice president. They’re very meaningful. They’re impactful. They’re informative. They’re communicative. We talk to each other. But then we do get down to the individual hospital level, because when the rubber meets the road, you got to know what the docs, nurses, respiratory therapists, the people who clean the rooms are important part of the team. I want them to come to every work saying, “It’s not that I cleaned a room, I’m saving lives today.” And they are saving lives by keeping the viruses off the surfaces and reducing transmission. You’ve really got to get that granular, and we’re to a point with Admiral P’s… you have two admirals with the worst pronounced names in the world. So Admiral P. I’m Admiral G, but Admiral P’s team really has this covered down to the individual hospital level."
2020-04-06,02:10:05,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir."
2020-04-06,02:10:06,Mike Pence,"Let me say just by way of closing, because I thought that last question was helpful. We’re interacting with governors every day, seven days a week and we welcome that. And while there are some resources in Strategic National Reserve, we spoke about ventilators. We have some 9,000 ventilators on standby. We also have this vast array through the commercial system that when we hear from governors, we’re identifying the needs. They’re working every day to identify their hospital capacity. We went over governors today saying, “We need to know what your capacity is, what your normal capacity is, what your surge capacity is. We need to understand what your equipment complement is across the state.” And governors have been doing this. They’ve been assembling that information. But I want to tell you, the governors across this country in both political parties had been doing a remarkable job and the president’s grateful and I’m grateful and I just want to know that those health care workers that they’re serving and the families that those healthcare workers are serving can be confident that we are going to do whatever it takes to get them what they need, when they need it. And every governor is working in that regard. Every hospital administrator is working in that regard."
2020-04-06,02:11:32,Mike Pence,"And the opportunity that we have because the American people are stepping up so strongly and putting others ahead of themselves. In most cases, they’re acting in a way that puts the health of others first. We’re more confident today than ever before that we’re going to be able to provide our healthcare providers in the states that are impacted with coronavirus with the resources and the support they need to meet this moment. And we’re just going to continue to work our hearts out and make that a reality."
2020-04-06,02:12:11,Mike Pence,"But I have to end with just a reference to the healthcare workers. You’ve heard these doctors talk about them. They’re all healthcare people. You’ve heard the president talk about them. You all have seen it. And to think what these healthcare workers, doctors and nurses and medical assistants are doing every day, it inspires us to get up early, to stay up late, to keep working, to make sure they have what they need to be able to continue to do their job courageously. And I know I speak on behalf of every American, when I say how grateful we are for each and every one of you and in this very special holy week, I know millions of Americans are praying for our healthcare workers."
2020-04-06,02:12:57,Mike Pence,"I saw a picture that I sent out last night on Twitter. It was an article about a series of cities where doctors and nurses had paused to pray for the patients and the families that they were ministering to. And I just want to say to all those healthcare workers, I know there is a chorus of prayer going up every day for all of you and with your continued courageous service and with God’s help, we’ll get through this and we’ll get through it together. Thank you all."
2020-04-06,02:13:28,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-04-07,00:05,Donald Trump,Thank you very much.
2020-04-07,00:12,Donald Trump,"Today we continue to send our love to the great people of New York and New Jersey and we support them fully. We grieve alongside every family who has lost a precious loved one. New Yorkers are tough and strong and brave. New Jerseyites are tough and strong and brave, and they’re being hit very hard right now. And for the next week, hopefully not much longer than that, it’s going to start to go in the other direction. Our country is being hit hard, but some areas have done so incredibly well. We’re so proud of them. They will beat this virus. We’re going to beat it with the grit and the heart for which they’re known and for which our country is known. And we appreciate everything that everybody is doing."
2020-04-07,01:02,Donald Trump,"We also, we pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He’s become a great friend of ours. He loves this country. He loves his country, but he loves the USA. And he’s always been very good to us. Whenever we had difficulty, he was with us and we appreciate it. So we prayed for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He’s going through a lot."
2020-04-07,01:22,Donald Trump,"As we intensify our military campaign against the virus, I think that it must be brought out that we have to thank the American people for continuing to follow our guidelines on slowing the spread and expression that more and more people are thinking about. Nobody ever heard of it two months ago and now everybody’s talking about slowing the spread, stopping the spread."
2020-04-07,01:47,Donald Trump,"Even during this painful week, we see glimmers of very, very strong hope, and this will be a very painful week and next week at least part of next week, but probably all of it. Look, if one person dies, it’s a painful week. And we know that’s going to unfortunately happen. This is a monster we’re fighting, but signs are that our strategy is totally working. Every American has a role to play in winning this war, and we’re going to be winning it. We’re going to be winning it powerfully, and we’ll be prepared for the next one should it happen but hopefully it won’t."
2020-04-07,02:25,Donald Trump,"Our massive airlift operation for critical supplies, it’s called Project Airbridge, continued today as five massive planes, flights landed in the United States, packed with personal protective equipment. And our nation’s heroic healthcare workers will be the beneficiaries of that. 27 more flights are scheduled in the near future over the next couple of weeks. The Army Corps of Engineers is constructing facilities that will support more than 15,000 hospital beds to treat in need. So they’re building now approximately 15,000. They just completed the big one in New York. They just completed and are in the process of continuing in Chicago and many other places. They’re incredible, the Army Corps of Engineers. We owe them a lot. What they were able to do in such a short period of time, they’ll build these massive facilities, 2000 beds in four days. So it’s really something very special. I know I was in the construction industry and you don’t see that happen very often."
2020-04-07,03:32,Donald Trump,"I want to remind governors and emergency managers that sharing real time data with us about equipment and their needs is very important. All of their supplies, hospital occupancy is critical. A lot of the occupancy is really getting a little bit lower than anticipated and that’s good. We sort of thought that was going to happen, and we getting along very well with the governors. This whole situation with respect to talking to us about equipment and equipment needs, giving us a little bit of lead time, so important. All the supplies, we’re getting it to everybody like they never thought possible. But we’ll ensure that we can rapidly deploy federal assets where and when they’re needed, especially on ventilators. We’re actually getting some ventilators back. As you know, the state of California was great. They sent some back, which they won’t need. And Washington state likewise. And we have some others coming back, so we’re using them in areas we need them."
2020-04-07,04:38,Donald Trump,"We are pressing forward aggressively on the scientific frontier of the medical war. The companies I’ve spoke to the four leading, I call them the genius companies. They’re doing incredibly well with respect to cures and also with respect to a vaccine that’s going to protect us, totally protect us. And they have some great potential. It’s going to take a little while yet, but they have some great potential, some great early results."
2020-04-07,05:12,Donald Trump,"And the governors been working hard, and we are working hard with the governors has been great coordination, especially over the last little while. We’ve given them a lot of equipment, a lot of ventilators, but a lot of equipment of all types. And I will protect you if your governor fails. If you have a governor that’s failing, we’re going to protect you. But the governors are working well with us over the last period of time."
2020-04-07,05:38,Donald Trump,"Today in our stockpile of ventilators and again we need the stockpile so we can immediately move them from place to place wherever the monster hits. It’s a monster. We have 8675 ventilators right now in stock ready to move, and we have all sorts of incredible soldiers. Our military is going to move them should they be needed in as an example, if we need additional in New York or the New York city area. You have state, you have city, and spoke to Mayor De Blasio, and we’ve really have a great well coordinated campaign with Mayor De Blasio. It’s been really good. Spoke to Governor Cuomo. It’s been great coordination. So if they need something, we have it. If Louisiana needs something, we have it. Same thing with Michigan. Same thing with Illinois. There are certain spots that are very hot, and we’ll see what happens. But we’ll know pretty much… We’ll have time, and we’ll be able to move it."
2020-04-07,06:41,Donald Trump,"In addition to the 8675 ventilators, we have 2200 arriving on April 13th. We have 5500 arriving on May 4th. These are ones that we’re building for the most part and we have, as you know, great companies building them Ford, General Motors, GE. We have really some great companies that are doing it."
2020-04-07,07:08,Donald Trump,"On May 18th, we have 12,000. On June 1st, we have 20,000. On June 29th, we have 60,000 ventilators coming. 66. Oh. So we have a total of 110,000 ventilators coming over a short period of time. I don’t think we’ll need them. Hopefully we won’t need them. I don’t think we’ll need anywhere near that, but we’ll have them for the future. And we’ll also be able to help other countries who are desperate for ventilators."
2020-04-07,07:38,Donald Trump,"The UK called today and they wanted to know would it be possible to get 200, and we’re going to work it out. We got to work it out. They’ve been great partners, United Kingdom. And we’re going to work it out for them. So they wanted 200. They needed them desperately."
2020-04-07,07:54,Donald Trump,"We now have 10 drugs in active trials with 15 more soon to follow, as well as two vaccine candidates, inactive clinical trials. We’ll do whatever it takes to secure needed medical supplies and bring more production of essential medicines back to our shores. We’re doing that. We’re bringing them back to our shores. A lot of these companies, they went a little bit haywire. They went away from this great country, and they had them produced elsewhere. So we’re going to start bringing it back. I’ve been talking about that for a long time, not only with medical but lots of other things."
2020-04-07,08:33,Donald Trump,"America continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world, and I think that’s probably why we have more cases. Because when you look at some of these very large countries, I know for a fact that they have far more cases than we do but they don’t report them. We’ve performed 1.87 million tests today. So that’s 1,870,000 million tests. Think of that 1,870,000 tests to date. And now we’re performing them at a level that nobody’s ever seen before."
2020-04-07,09:07,Donald Trump,"As we announced yesterday, CVS testing sites in Georgia and Rhode Island will be using Abbott Labs, rapid five-minute tests. We’re down to now five minutes. It’s a five minute test so that people can get the results back very quickly."
2020-04-07,09:22,Donald Trump,"And we’re actively engaging on the problem of increased impacts. This is a real problem and it’s showing up very strongly in our data on the African American community, and we’re doing everything in our power to address this challenge. It’s a tremendous challenge. It’s terrible. And provide support to African American a lot. But it’s been disproportional. They’re getting hit very, very hard. In fact, while we have Tony here, I’d like to maybe have you come up and address that one and then I’ll continue. But if you could address that, it would be great, Tony, please."
2020-04-07,10:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you, Mr. President. We have a particularly difficult problem of exacerbation of a health disparity. We’ve known literally forever that diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma are disproportionately afflicting the minority populations, particularly the African Americans. Unfortunately, when you look at the predisposing conditions that lead to a bad outcome with coronavirus, the things that get people into ICU that require intubation and often lead to death, they are just those very co-morbidities that are unfortunately disproportionately prevalent in the African American population. So we’re very concerned about that. It’s very sad. It’s nothing we can do about it right now except to try and give them the best possible care to avoid those complications."
2020-04-07,10:56,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-07,10:57,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. And Tony, I think you’re going to have some pretty accurate numbers over the next few days, right? But they’re very nasty numbers. Terrible numbers."
2020-04-07,11:07,Donald Trump,"In total, 1200 Abbott machines, Abbott Laboratories. They’ve been fantastic. Have been shipped now nationwide. Up to 500 more are being produced every week and 50,000 testing cartridges are being manufactured per day. That means a lot of very fast tests. No nation in the world has developed a more diverse and robust testing capacity than the United States. We’re dealing with other nations, helping them out because the testing is very tough for them and our tests are very accurate. A lot of tests are out there, and they’re not accurate at all. In fact, some of the tests you don’t have a clue what’s going on. So we’re working with other nations trying to get them help also."
2020-04-07,11:51,Donald Trump,"At a time when many Americans are experiencing increased stress, anxiety, and personal loss, we must also ensure that our country can meet the mental health needs of those struggling in this crisis. There are people struggling. They’re struggling and some people are getting to know each other frankly. Some families are getting to know each other on a positive note, but there are a lot of people struggling."
2020-04-07,12:12,Donald Trump,"On Thursday, I’ll be speaking to leaders and advocates from the mental health organizations all across our country, and we are going to be talking about resources and tools that we’ll make available to them. They need help, and it’s a big problem. When you take something where it was the most successful country in the world, still is, the whole world has shut down. Think of it. We’re down to numbers that are incredible. As I said yesterday, I think it’s 182 countries right now. 182 countries are under attack by the scorch, by this virus."
2020-04-07,12:58,Donald Trump,"But as we wage medical war on the virus, we’re also speeding economic relief to our people. It’s incredible. We just had a meeting that was absolutely incredible with the banks. I spoke with leaders in the banking and finance industry about our efforts to help American workers and employers. As of today, small business has processed more than $70 billion in guaranteed loans and will provide much needed relief for nearly a quarter of a million businesses already. So we are going to be providing tremendous amounts of money to the small businesses of our country who had been absolutely clobbered, and they’ll be keeping open. And they’ll be paying their employees, and they’ll be all set to go. We’re going to have a rocket upward."
2020-04-07,13:50,Donald Trump,"I want to thank David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs; Brian Monynihan, CEO of Bank of America; Gordon Smith, co-president, COO of JP Morgan Chase; Charles Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo; Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup; Al Kelly, CEO of Visa; Michael Miebach, CEO of MasterCard; Noah Wilcox, CEO, chairman of Grand Rapids State Bank, and we had numerous others also on the call. And I just appreciate them. We’re way ahead of schedule, by the way. We’re way ahead of schedule."
2020-04-07,14:33,Donald Trump,"The paycheck protection program has been incredible. So based on the incredible success of the program, I’m announcing that I’ll be asking Congress to provide an additional $250 billion for the paycheck protection, which will help keep Americans employed to facilitate a quick and full recovery. We’re doing very well. We’re looking very bipartisan. A lot of people want to do it, and the plan is amazing. They’re processing hundreds of thousands of loans and this is the big banks that are doing it, the community banks. But the biggest banks right now in our country are doing it and they’re doing it for a lot of reasons. One of them is they want to help people."
2020-04-07,15:20,Donald Trump,"The WHO, that’s the World Health Organization, receives vast amounts of money from the United States, and we pay for a majority or biggest portion of their money. And they actually criticized and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it, and they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things. And they had a lot of information early and they didn’t want to… They seemed to be very China centric, and we have to look into that. So we’re going to look into it. We give a majority of the money that they get, and it’s much more than the 58. $58 million is a small portion of what they’ve gotten over the years. Sometimes they get much more than that. Sometimes it’s for programs that they’re doing, and it’s much bigger numbers. And if the programs are good, that’s great as far as we’re concerned. But we want to look into it-World Health Organization-because they really are a… They called it wrong. They called it wrong. They missed the call. They could’ve called it months earlier. They would have known, and they should’ve known. And they probably did know. So we’ll be looking into that very carefully, and we’re going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we’re going to see. It’s a great thing if it works. But when they call every shot wrong, that’s no good."
2020-04-07,16:53,Donald Trump,"We’re in the midst of the great national struggle, one that requires the shared sacrifice of all Americans. In recent weeks, it’s been remarkable to see so many companies and organizations and individuals, like the banks that I just told you about, biggest banks in the world. They stepped up to help small business. They had big business, small business. The small business will someday be the big business, but the small business is 50% of our economic strength. People don’t realize when you add them up, but they just rose to the occasion. Everybody’s rising to the occasion. It’s been incredible to watch."
2020-04-07,17:28,Donald Trump,"To honor and celebrate the extraordinary examples of patriotism and citizenship, we’re seeing… I’m asking Americans to use the #AmericaWorksTogether when sharing stories of how we’re all working together, getting through this ordeal in a fashion that nobody would have thought possible. It’s been incredible and that’s why the numbers are so far much better. We want to keep it that way. If you look at the original projections, if we did nothing, it would be a disastrous. If we decided to do something, we closed it down, had no choice. It was a good move. That was a good move. The early China move was a good move. The early Europe move was a good move. I had a lot of good moves, but closing it down was a big statement, was a big important thing. But we’re looking to have far fewer deaths than originally thought, and I think we’re heading in that direction. But it’s too early to talk about it. I don’t even want to talk about it now because we just want to work."
2020-04-07,18:33,Donald Trump,"And I think that people are doing an incredible job. The doctors, the nurses, the firefighters, the police, all medical people, what they’re doing, the bravery that they’re displaying is just incredible. Every citizen should take immense pride and the selflessness and all of the courage and compassion of our people. The workers, the people that are working and construction workers going into hospitals knowing nothing about this problem other than it’s dangerous. And they go in there to rebuild sections of hospitals. And you have people in really big trouble right next door. They know nothing about it. All they know is they’re going to get it done. They’re going to fix that wing so they can have more people in there. It’s incredible."
2020-04-07,19:24,Donald Trump,"But this is a national spirit that won our independence and settled the frontier and explored the horizons in space and that’s what we’re doing. I mean, this is all new territory. It unlocked the miracles of science and we’re doing that. I wish you could have heard the calls I had yesterday with these great companies that come up with cures to diseases and the success they’ve had over the last 15 years is really amazing. So I just want to thank all of them. They’re working very hard. They’re working with UK right now. In the UK, doctors hopefully helping with their great Prime Minister. But these people are really a tremendous signs of success, are staring us right in the face. I think we’re going to have something that’s going to be great in terms of vaccines and in terms of everything else that they’re doing. Just helping, really helping us, helping the people of our country and helping ultimately the people of the world."
2020-04-07,20:24,Donald Trump,"So I want to thank you all for being here. I will take some questions and then I’m going to give it over to the Vice President, and they’re going to go into great detail onto what we’re doing and all of the successful supplies and medical equipment that we’re getting. All of the ventilators. I’ve said it, but you could go over it in more detail if you’d like. But we’re taking in and building thousands and thousands of ventilators, and they’re very high quality. I said, you got to go for the quality. And these are quality companies doing it. So because there is a big difference between a good ventilator and a not so good ventilator, Tony, right? We’ve seen that. And a big difference. So we’re going top of the line."
2020-04-07,21:01,Donald Trump,"Steve, please."
2020-04-07,21:02,Steve (Reporter),"The Acting Navy Secretary submitted his resignation today, Modly. Why did that become necessary and what role did you have in this, sir?"
2020-04-07,21:10,Donald Trump,"Well, I had no role in it. I don’t know him, but I’ve heard he was very good man. And the whole thing was a very unfortunate. The captain should not have written a letter. He didn’t have to be Ernest Hemingway. He made a mistake, but he had a bad day. And I hate seeing bad things happen. Man made a mistake, but he shouldn’t be writing letters. And you’re in the military, you’re the captain of a great ship. And you shouldn’t be writing letters and sending them to many people. And then it gets out to the media and the question is how did it get out to the media. So there’s a lot of bad things happen there. And I had heard he did because he didn’t want to cause any disturbance for our country. So that was a… Because he wouldn’t have had to resign. I would not have asked him. I don’t know him. I didn’t speak to him. But he did that I think just to end that problem. And I think in really many ways, that was a very unselfish thing for him to do."
2020-04-07,22:16,Steve (Reporter),"What should happen now that Commander Crozier, who-"
2020-04-07,22:18,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re going to look at that. I think Secretary of Defense, as you know, is Mark Esper and he’s very capable. And I think he’s looking at that right now. They’re going to just take it under regular Navy channels to see what they want to do. But he made a mistake, but he shouldn’t have done that. And your secretary probably shouldn’t have said quite what he said. He didn’t have to resign, but he felt it would be better for the country. So I think it will end it quickly."
2020-04-07,22:54,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-04-07,22:55,George,"Mr. President, a couple on the economic front. The $250 billion that was added today or will be added for the small business loan program, brings it to 600 billion in total. Do you think that figure is enough? Might there [crosstalk 00:23:08]-"
2020-04-07,23:08,Donald Trump,We’re going to find out.
2020-04-07,23:09,George,… more down the line.
2020-04-07,23:09,Donald Trump,"When you see hundreds of thousands of applications, don’t forget they’re for $3000 for $7000, some for a couple of million. I guess one of the banks had a couple of million. So they’re for different, very varying amounts of money. And there’s a limit on the top and then there’s really no limit on the bottom as to what it might be. But it’s really popular. It’s hundreds of thousands of applications. They really like it. What I like is it keeps these companies together, these little companies. Just like we’re going to help the airlines and the big companies, we’re going to help the little companies. And the banks are running. Nobody’s equipped to do a thing like that, but the banks are equipped. So the banks are doing it. Big banks, small banks. We have many banks, community banks. And they’re processing the loans, and they’ll be able to watch it and make sure it’s done properly."
2020-04-07,23:55,George,"Talk today, sir, as well, about potentially reopening the economy in the upcoming weeks. You mentioned the other day about a potential economic task force. Can you give us some sort of update as to where that [crosstalk 00:24:05]-"
2020-04-07,24:04,Donald Trump,"We’re thinking about that. But we want to open up, but we want to get it open soon. That’s why I think maybe we’re getting to the very top of the curve. I spoke with Governor Cuomo and he seems to think that he’s getting close. And I think a lot of people think that a lot of places are getting close. We want to start heading that, hitting the downside, and I think we’re going to be doing… This is going to be a very difficult week however. This week will be a very difficult week because that’s the most difficult week when you’re at that top position, and we’ll see what happens. We’ll see what happens."
2020-04-07,24:35,George,[inaudible 00:24:35] What can the federal government do? [crosstalk 00:00:24:39].
2020-04-07,24:40,Donald Trump,"Well, the federal government has done a lot, and it’s going to do a lot. I really think that with the stimulus, we can be… Maybe even beyond. We’re going to do perhaps infrastructure, which you wouldn’t have gotten approved before and now people are looking to do it. And the beauty is we’re paying zero interest or very close to zero interest. In some cases, we’re paying actually zero, have no interest, George. And the dollar is very strong, and people are investing in the dollar. The fact that we have the strong currency… We have the currency. Our currency is everything. And other companies, other countries want to be in our currency."
2020-04-07,25:19,Donald Trump,"So we’re getting all of the investment wanting to come into the dollar. The dollar is the strength. The dollar is the whole ball game. And we have a strong dollar. Other currencies are going down, way, way down in some cases. You look at other countries, I won’t mention them, but other countries are going down 22%, 25%, 28%. and it’s very hard for them. That makes it much more difficult. With us, our currency is relatively now stronger than it ever was or it was over the last few years relative to other countries. It’s always relative to other countries, but our currency is very strong. So therefore people want to invest. If we do a bond issue to do infrastructure, everybody wants a piece of that issue, even at zero interest."
2020-04-07,26:07,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-04-07,26:08,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Did you see these memos that are reportedly Peter Navarro wrote back in January. When did you see them and how does these memos sort of square with what you’ve often said that nobody could have predicted this? It sounds like he was predicting."
2020-04-07,26:20,Donald Trump,"I didn’t see them, but I heard he wrote some memos talking about pandemic. I didn’t see them. I didn’t look for them either, but that was about the same time as I felt that we should do it. That was about the same time that I closed it down. I asked him about it just a little while ago because I read something about a memo. I said, “Did you do a memo?” I didn’t look for… I didn’t see it. I didn’t ask him to show it to me. He said, “Yes. I talked about the possibility of a pandemic.” Nobody said it’s going to happen, but there is a possibility. There always has been a possibility, but people wouldn’t talk about it. But it was right about the time that I closed it down. And interestingly, the World Health Organization was not in favor of us closing it down. And-"
2020-04-07,27:03,Donald Trump,"… was not in favor of us closing it down, and if we didn’t close it down, we would have lost hundreds of thousands more lives. [crosstalk 00:27:10] We did a good thing. Yeah, [inaudible 00:27:12]."
2020-04-07,27:12,Unnamed,"So, at the time, though, when Peter Navarro did circulate those memos, you were still downplaying the threat of coronavirus in the US. You were saying things like, “I think it’s a problem that’s going to go away within a couple of days.”"
2020-04-07,27:24,Donald Trump,Which I was right about. It will go away.
2020-04-07,27:27,Unnamed,"You said within a couple of days, the cases will be down to zero."
2020-04-07,27:29,Donald Trump,"Well, the cases really didn’t build up for a while, but you have to understand, I’m a cheerleader for this country. I don’t want to create havoc and shock and everything else. But ultimately, when I was saying that, I’m also closing it down. I obviously was concerned about it because I closed down our country to China, which was heavily infected. I then closed it down to Europe. That’s a big move, closing it down from China and then closing it down from Europe, and then ultimately closing it down to the UK. And it was right about that time. But I’m not going to go out and start screaming, this could happen, this could happen."
2020-04-07,28:08,Donald Trump,"So again, as president, I think a president has to be a cheerleader for their country. But at the same time I’m cheerleading, I’m also closing down a very highly infected place, specifically the location, as you know, in China that had the problems. And we’re closing it down, but we close it down to all of China, then we close it down to all of Europe. Those were big moves, and it was right about that time"
2020-04-07,28:34,Unnamed,"Sorry, sir, just a quick followup, Mr. President. [crosstalk 00:01:35]."
2020-04-07,28:36,Unnamed,"Mr. President, did you just learn about this today?"
2020-04-07,28:38,Donald Trump,Today?
2020-04-07,28:39,Unnamed,"You learned about the memo today, just-"
2020-04-07,28:40,Donald Trump,"I read about it maybe a day, two days ago."
2020-04-07,28:43,Unnamed,Do you feel like someone among your staff or Peter Navarro himself should have told you about the [crosstalk 00:28:48] earlier?
2020-04-07,28:48,Donald Trump,"No. It was a recommendation. It was a feeling that he had. I think he told certain people in the staff, but it didn’t matter. I didn’t see it, but I closed it down. I don’t remember it even being discussed. We had a meeting where there were a lot of people. Most people felt they should not close it down, that we shouldn’t close down to China. But I felt we had to do it. And that was almost the exact same time as the memo."
2020-04-07,29:15,Unnamed,"If you had read the memo at the time, how would that have changed the steps you took or the statements that you [crosstalk 00:29:15]?"
2020-04-07,29:17,Donald Trump,"I don’t think it would have changed, because I basically did what the memo said. And the memo was a pretty good memo from the standpoint that he talked, I guess. I didn’t see it yet."
2020-04-07,29:26,Unnamed,"He was saying that the US would, warning that the US would."
2020-04-07,29:27,Donald Trump,"Well, you’re not going to lose millions of lives, but you’ll lose plenty of money. But I couldn’t have done it any better because it was about the same time, and I closed it down to China."
2020-04-07,29:40,Unnamed,"Just lastly, so you maintain confidence in him, in Peter Navarro?"
2020-04-07,29:44,Donald Trump,"Of course maintain confidence. He wrote a memo, and he was right. And I haven’t seen the memo. I’ll see it later on after this. But it didn’t matter whether I saw it or not because I acted on my own. I guess I had the same instincts as Peter. Peter’s a smart guy,, and he’s a good guy and he’s done a wonderful job. But he wrote a memo, and I guess he talked to various people about it. But ultimately, I did more or less what the memo said just about the time the memo came out. I closed it down. I took a lot of heat. The World Health Organization was very much against. They didn’t like it. They actually put out statements about it. In all fairness to Joe Biden, he called me xenophobic, like I don’t like China. I like China. The Chinese people are phenomenal people."
2020-04-07,30:31,Donald Trump,"So, I was called xenophobic. I was called racist. How could I do a thing like this? Now, since then, Joe said that he was wrong, and he said that I was right. But I closed it down and I was called names by some of The Morning Show hosts who don’t have a clue what they’re talking about. They’re not smart people. And I was called all sorts of names when I closed it down to China. Now they try and hide that, the tape of them saying terrible things. But that was a great decision. If I didn’t do it, if I didn’t do that, we would have had hundreds of thousands more people dying. Yeah, please."
2020-04-07,31:10,Unnamed,"You talked a lot about the WHO, and I was wondering, Dr. Fauci had discussed them earlier, so if I could ask you a question about-"
2020-04-07,31:17,Donald Trump,"Well, he respects the WHO, and I think that’s good. And he’s worked with him for a long time. But they did give us some pretty bad play calling."
2020-04-07,31:26,Unnamed,"They’ve also, I think, given lots of countries in the world the accurate coronavirus testing that’s been central to your guys’ data modeling, and so-"
2020-04-07,31:34,Donald Trump,"That, I don’t know, I can only say that with regard to us, they’re taking a lot of heat because they didn’t want the borders closed. They called it wrong. They really called, I would say, every aspect of it wrong."
2020-04-07,31:48,Unnamed,So [inaudible 00:31:48] the funding freeze doesn’t-
2020-04-07,31:50,Donald Trump,"Look, we fund it. Take a look. I mean, go through step by step. They said there’s no big deal, there’s no big problem, there’s no nothing. And then ultimately, when I closed it down, they actually said that I made a mistake in closing it down, and it turned out to be right. But at the time, they did that. So we’re just going to take a look at it. We fund it. And they seem to be, I said recently in social media, I said they seem to be very China-centric. That’s a nice way of saying it. But they seem to be very China-centric. [crosstalk 00:32:23] And they seem to always err on the side of China, and we fund it, so I want to look into it. Yes, please."
2020-04-07,32:29,Unnamed,"Thanks. A quick followup on that. So, is the time to freeze funding to the WHO during a pandemic of this magnitude?"
2020-04-07,32:38,Donald Trump,"No, maybe not. I mean, I’m not saying I’m going to do it, but we’re going to look at it."
2020-04-07,32:41,Unnamed,You did say that you were going to do it.
2020-04-07,32:43,Donald Trump,"No, I didn’t. I said we’re going to look at it, we’re going to investigate it, we’re going to look at it. But we will look at ending funding. Yeah. Because you know what? They called it wrong. And if you look back over the years even, everything seems to be very biased toward China. That’s not right."
2020-04-07,33:01,Unnamed,I wanted follow up. You talked about African Americans and how they’ve been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus.
2020-04-07,33:07,Donald Trump,"Seems to be, unfortunately."
2020-04-07,33:08,Unnamed,"Do you plan on requiring the CDC, any federal agencies or state agents, public places doing tests and private companies doing tests to collect that data on the race of the people being tested and the race of the people being treated and the outcomes?"
2020-04-07,33:27,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re seeing tremendous evidence that African Americans are affected at a far greater percentage number than other citizens of our country, because we’re dealing with our country. Now we’re looking at it from a worldwide standpoint. Tony Fauci is looking at it very strongly. But these numbers have started to come out, and they’re very strong, and they’re pretty obvious. I mean, you’re talking bout-"
2020-04-07,33:53,Unnamed,"But you will release that publicly? Sue, would you like to talk about that for a second? Please."
2020-04-07,33:57,Sue,"I think one of the things that we’re going to be doing with our Medicare data is to do that analysis. We’re going to look back at the last month or so and look at related type illnesses going forward. We now have a code for coronavirus so we can actually stratify by demographic information, so we can look at race as a factor. We can also look at what the underlying health issues are as well. So we’ll be providing that data very shortly. But we will be doing that analysis."
2020-04-07,34:24,Donald Trump,"We’ve been working on that very hard. This is something that’s come up over the last… I hadn’t heard this. And then over the last few days, this has come up more and more. And I don’t mean by a little bit, I mean many times. It’s a real thing. Now, we want to find cures, we want to find therapeutics, we want to find vaccines, because that will solve everybody’s problem. But why is it that the African American community is so much, numerous times more than everybody else? And we want to find the reason to it. And Dr. Fauci, so you met both of them, and others are working on this and they’re going to have very good, I would say in less than a week, I think, you’re going to have very good statistics. Couple of days [crosstalk 00:35:09]."
2020-04-07,35:09,Unnamed,"Are you going to do something specifically aimed at those communities that are being hard hit, those black communities that are being hard hit?"
2020-04-07,35:13,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re helping them a lot. But what’s happening is we’re trying to find out why is it that it’s three and four times? Now, maybe that’s not going to be the final number, but why is it three or four times more so for the black community as opposed to other people? It doesn’t make sense, and I don’t like it, and we’re going to have statistics over the next probably two to three days, okay? [crosstalk 00:35:37] Yeah, please. In the back."
2020-04-07,35:41,Unnamed,Thank you. I’d like to ask a question on behalf of myself and a colleague who couldn’t be here due to social distancing.
2020-04-07,35:46,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-04-07,35:46,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-04-07,35:47,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-04-07,35:48,Unnamed,"With Hearst newspapers, I’m [inaudible 00:35:51] today. Thank you. Some banks are only providing paycheck protection program loans to clients with whom they have existing banking relationships. And you spoke to banking CEOs today. I wonder if you’ll-"
2020-04-07,36:03,Donald Trump,I did.
2020-04-07,36:03,Unnamed,"… ask them, these lenders, to accept applications from all small businesses, not just the businesses with whom they have existing relationships."
2020-04-07,36:11,Donald Trump,"Okay. They’ll be doing that. But we’re also working with small community banks, so they will be doing that. It’s a question I’ve already spoken about. I mean, in many cases, they have long-term relationships with thousands of companies. I was amazed to see how many. You saw the number of applications. It’s hundreds of thousands. It’s a lot of work. But I did ask that question, and they are working on that."
2020-04-07,36:32,Unnamed,"Thank you. And my second question from a colleague is Congressman Gerry Connolly, Democrat from Northern Virginia, told the local DC CBS station that you personally requested the CARES Act stimulus bill be stripped of $25 billion for the postal service. Connolly claims that unless the USPS gets that $25 billion, the agency will be run out of money by June. He accuses you of hastening the demise of the postal service. Could you respond to that, please?"
2020-04-07,37:01,Donald Trump,"I’m the reason the postal service… The postal service has lost billions of dollars very year for many, many years. I’m the demise. This is a new one. I’m now the demise of the postal service. I’ll tell you who’s the demise of the postal service. So, these internet companies that give their stuff to the postal service, packages. I don’t run the postal service. You have a group of people, so-called independent people, and they run it. But these packages, they lose money every time they deliver a package for Amazon or these other internet companies, these other companies that deliver. They drop everything in the post office and they say, you deliver it. And if they’d raise the prices by actually a lot, then you’d find out that the post office could make money or break even. But they don’t do that. And I’m trying to figure out why."
2020-04-07,37:50,Donald Trump,"These are independent boards. They were appointed by other administrations. They’re sort of long-term, they’re there for a long time. And I’ve been talking to them also. You can look it up, take a look. They have to raise the prices to these companies that walk in and drop thousands of packages on the floor of the post office and say, deliver it. And they make money, but the post office gets killed, okay? So they ought to do that. And we’re looking into it. And we’ve been pushing them now for over a year. And you know that because you’ve seen the stories. I’m pushing them."
2020-04-07,38:23,Donald Trump,"It’s not fair to these great, wonderful modern companies. They walk into our old post office with all these routes that could never be built. You could never build them. They go into areas that you could never do, and they say, here, deliver this. And they lose a lot of money per package. And they have to raise their prices, but this postal commission doesn’t do it. Now, we just got a chance to appoint a couple of people onto the commission, as I understand it, and that’s good. But they have to raise their prices, otherwise they’re just going to lose a lot of money. And tell your Democrat friend that he ought to focus on that, because if he focused on that, he could truly save the post office. The post office has been losing billions of dollars a year for many, many years. And have him take a look at that because that’s the way to solve the problem. Yeah, please, there."
2020-04-07,39:10,Unnamed,"Thank you so much, Mr. President. Thank you so much. Mr. President, you say this week could be very painful, very difficult. But a few weeks ago, you say this was just like a flu. What have you learned-"
2020-04-07,39:20,Donald Trump,I didn’t say two weeks ago it was a flu.
2020-04-07,39:21,Unnamed,"Few weeks ago. The question is, Mr. President-"
2020-04-07,39:23,Donald Trump,You know what? Can I tell you what? Excuse me. Ready?
2020-04-07,39:25,Unnamed,What have you learned that you could offer as an advice to foreign leaders who still are skeptical about this pandemic and who are against social distancing? What is your advice? What have you learned?
2020-04-07,39:37,Donald Trump,"Okay. You said I said it was just like a flu. So, the worst pandemic we ever had in this world was a flu, and it was called, you know that. It was in 1917, 1918, and anywhere from 50 to a hundred million people died. That was a flu, okay? So you could say that I said it was a flu, or you could say the flu is nothing to sneeze at."
2020-04-07,40:04,Unnamed,"But my question, Mr. President, what can you offer as an a advice for foreign leaders who are skeptical, skeptical about this pandemic and who are against social distancing?"
2020-04-07,40:14,Donald Trump,"Well, I think there aren’t too many of them. If you look throughout the world, and just about everyone that has practiced that is now closing up. Well, the UK was an example. Now, they talk about Sweden, but Sweden is suffering very greatly. You know that, right? Sweden did that. The herd, they call it the herd. Sweden’s suffering very, very badly. It’s a way of doing it, but everybody has been watching everybody else, and so far, almost every country has done it the way we’ve done it, we’ve chosen to do it. If we didn’t do it that way, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of more people. Okay. [crosstalk 00:40:56]"
2020-04-07,40:57,Unnamed,"Mr. President, there’s voting going on today in Wisconsin. There are reports of thousands of people waiting in hours, long lines, as they’ve had to weigh their own personal health and their civic responsibility. Do you think that the Supreme Court was right in its decision that voting should go forward and the absentee extension should not take place?"
2020-04-07,41:17,Donald Trump,"Look, the Supreme Court, well, of course they were right, because what the Democrats wanted, and you know what this happened. I supported a man named Justice Kelly, who is Daniel Kelly, highly respected justice. And I supported him just the other day, social media. I know of him. He’s just a fantastic judge, justice. And I endorsed him. And as soon as I endorsed him, they wanted to move the election. They didn’t want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, oh, let’s move the election to two months later, three. They didn’t mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting. And now they talk about, oh, safety, safety. Well, it was 15 minutes after I put out an endorsement that they said we have to move the election. They didn’t want to move the election before that."
2020-04-07,42:05,Donald Trump,"The other thing they wanted to do, which is crazy, at the end of the election, they wanted to have one week for proxies to come in or mail ballots. Now, mail ballots, they cheat, okay? People cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they’re cheaters. They go and collect them. They’re fraudulent, in many cases. You got to vote. And they should have voter ID, by the way. You want to really do it right, you have voter ID. But the Democrats, and this was turned over in the Supreme Court yesterday. I give great credit to the court. They actually didn’t want to have an election day. They wanted to have election day, and then a week after election day, you choose your camp. All these ballots come in. These mailed ballots come in. The mail ballots are corrupt, in my opinion. And they collect them, and they get people to go in and sign them, and then they’re forgeries in many cases. It’s a horrible thing."
2020-04-07,42:56,Donald Trump,"And so, what happened is, the Democrats in Wisconsin, they had no problem with the election being today until I endorsed the Republican candidate, Justice Kelly, Daniel Kelly. And as soon as I endorsed him, they went crazy. They went crazy. And you know that’s true. And now all of a sudden, because go back two weeks, go back two days. They didn’t want to move the election. They were having the election and they were fine, because they thought they were going to win the election. Then I endorsed him, and all of a sudden, they think they’re not. Now I understand there are lines that go back a long way. I hope they’re going to vote for Justice Kelly, okay? [crosstalk 00:43:35] No, go."
2020-04-07,43:39,Unnamed,"With millions of pills of hydroxychloroquine donated, is there a plan or system in place to track the potential side effects [crosstalk 00:43:51]-"
2020-04-07,43:48,Donald Trump,"Well, you saw the representative-"
2020-04-07,43:49,Unnamed,… serious harm. So is there a plan to track the side effects of hydroxychloroquine?
2020-04-07,43:49,Donald Trump,"The side effects are the least of it. You have people dying all over the place. And generally, the side effects are really with the Z-Pak having to do with the heart. The Z-Pak. That’s the antibiotic, not with the hydroxychloroquine. So, a woman last night, I watched her on one of the shows, good show, Laura. And she thought she was dead. She was a representative from Michigan. She was just in horrible shape for 12 days, 14 days. She thought she was dead. I think she said that her doctor said it’s going to be very tough. She saw me talking about this, and she asked her husband to go to the drugstore. Now, this is a Democrat representative, a person that perhaps wouldn’t be voting for me. I think she’ll be voting for me now, even if she’s a Democrat, even if she’s a Democrat representative."
2020-04-07,44:55,Donald Trump,"And they went to the store, which I made available, because we have millions of doses. We have, I think, 29 million doses of this drug. And she asked her husband. She said, “Please go out. I’m not going to make it. Please.” You have to hear a story. “Please go out, get it.” He went at 10 o’clock in the evening to the drug store. He got it. He gave it to her. Now, I don’t say it works like this at all. Four hours later, she awoke, and she said, “I feel better.” And then shortly thereafter, she felt great. This is a woman that thought she was going to die."
2020-04-07,45:36,Donald Trump,"I mean, she’s a Democrat representative, highly respected woman, African American woman. I don’t know if you saw it, as you asked a question about African Americans. She was an African American woman, a great woman. Her manner of speaking, the way she told the story, was beautiful. “I asked my husband to go and get it. He got it.” She is now okay. I mean, she was interviewed last night on television, and she thanked me. She thanked me even in a tweet. She said, “I want to thank President Trump. He saved my life.” Look, I don’t say that happens with everybody, but that’s a beautiful story. There are many of those stories. And I say, try it. Okay, please. [crosstalk 00:46:19]"
2020-04-07,46:18,Donald Trump,"I mean, if you’re in trouble. If you’re going to die and you’re going to die, I mean, you’re not going to die from this pill. Now, there could be some side effects, but the side effects is really more so from the Z-Pak."
2020-04-07,46:34,Unnamed,Is there a plan to track those side effects?
2020-04-07,46:34,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. Doctors have to recommend it. I want doctors. I’m not a doctor. I’m just saying we hear great results. And some people say, let’s go to a laboratory. Let’s test it for a couple of years. No, we got people dying in this country and all over the world right now, not in a couple of years. They’re dying. As we speak, there are people dying. And I really think it’s a great thing to try just based on what I know. Again, I’m not a doctor. And I say, get a physician’s approval. And they have physicians in these hospitals, great physicians, brave physicians. They also say it’s good for the hospital workers to take them, that it keeps it away, keeps it out of your system."
2020-04-07,47:17,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. But there’s a lot of good examples. And we have a 1,500 case study going in New York, and it’s almost complete. So it’ll be very interesting to see what happens. Go ahead."
2020-04-07,47:30,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Can you talk-"
2020-04-07,47:31,Donald Trump,"But I appreciate that woman. She was great. You have to see it to believe it. The way she spoke, it was like a miracle. And this was not a fan of mine, but she’s a fan of mine now, and I’m very honored by it. Go ahead."
2020-04-07,47:44,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Can you talk about your decision to remove Glenn Fine from the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, and that move and some of the criticism you’ve leveled at IGs? How does the American public have confidence that there’ll be oversight?"
2020-04-07,47:57,Donald Trump,"Yeah. Well, we have a lot of IGs in from the Obama era. And as you know, it’s a presidential decision. And I left them, largely. I mean, I changed some, but I left them. But when we have reports of bias and when we have different things coming in… I don’t know Fine. I don’t think I ever met Fine. I heard the name."
2020-04-07,48:17,Unnamed,He wasn’t an Obama-
2020-04-07,48:18,Donald Trump,"I heard the name. I don’t know where he is. Maybe it was from Clinton, okay? Check that out, okay/ Maybe he’s from Clinton. But we did change him, but we changed a number. We have about seven nominations in. I believe we put seven very, very highly qualified people for the IG position. And that’s a decision that I could have made three years ago and I could have made two years ago. But we’re putting in not so much for him. We’re putting in seven names. I think it was seven, and they’re going in now. Yeah."
2020-04-07,48:48,Unnamed,"Mr. President, when you talk about the WHO being China-centric, what exactly are you talking about? Is it because China has underplayed how many victims they’ve got?"
2020-04-07,48:56,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. They seem to come down on the side of China. Don’t close your borders to China. Don’t do this. They don’t report what’s really going on. They didn’t see it, and yet, they were there. They didn’t see what was going on in Wuhan. They didn’t see it. How do you not see it? They didn’t see it. They didn’t report it. They must have seen it, but they didn’t report it. Please go ahead."
2020-04-07,49:15,Unnamed,"Mr. President, just turning back to the voting in Wisconsin and those long lines, who will be responsible and should be held responsible if people get sick after they’ve voted?"
2020-04-07,49:25,Donald Trump,"Look, all I did was endorse a candidate. I don’t know anything about their lines. I don’t know anything about their voting. I love the state. I won the state."
2020-04-07,49:35,Unnamed,But you also encouraged people to get out and vote today as well. Won’t you take some of the responsibility if some of those people get sick?
2020-04-07,49:38,Donald Trump,"I won the state, which is rare for a Republican to do, but I won the state of Wisconsin. I’m going to win it again, because we’ve been great to the people of Wisconsin as you know, with our policies. And they like me and I like them. But all I did was endorse a candidate that’s highly qualified, a very respected person, and all hell broke loose as soon as I did that. And then all of a sudden, they want to change. Before I endorsed him, they didn’t want to change this voting area. There was no problem with the Democrats voting until I endorsed the candidate. Then they said, let’s move it to two months. Let’s move it three months later. Safety, safety, safety, right? All of a sudden, they want safety. Well, before I did the endorsement, they didn’t talk about safety. It was fine for months. For months, it was fine. It was always going to be. And now I endorse, and they want safety. So, you know it sounds [crosstalk 00:23:31]."
2020-04-07,50:35,Unnamed,"Thank you. Just to follow up on that, how does the election, them holding this election in Wisconsin, line up with the social distancing recommendations that have come from your administration?"
2020-04-07,50:47,Donald Trump,"Well, there you have to ask the people that… You have a Democrat in Wisconsin as governor. Ask him. That’s his problem. Okay? He should be doing it. Again, some governors fail, and I won’t let them fail, because when they fail, I’ll help. But that’s run by Democrats right now. Okay? It’s run by Democrats. Yeah, they have great Republicans."
2020-04-07,51:10,Unnamed,Is it possible to socially distance when you’re voting? You’re going to have crowds [crosstalk 00:51:14]-
2020-04-07,51:14,Donald Trump,"You have to speak to the governor. What you should do is call the governor of Wisconsin and ask him that question, but also ask him how come it was okay to do this until I endorsed the candidate? And as soon as I endorsed him, these lines are formed and I hear the lines are through the roof. So hopefully, they’re going to vote for the right candidate. Yeah, please. [crosstalk 00:51:34]"
2020-04-07,51:36,Unnamed,Can I just check in on the oil again today? I was wondering-
2020-04-07,51:38,Donald Trump,Oil?
2020-04-07,51:38,Unnamed,Yeah.
2020-04-07,51:38,Donald Trump,Where is it today?
2020-04-07,51:39,Unnamed,Well-
2020-04-07,51:41,Donald Trump,"No, no, where’s the price? Give me the price."
2020-04-07,51:44,Unnamed,"I’m not sure, to be honest."
2020-04-07,51:47,Donald Trump,How can you ask a question when you don’t know the price?
2020-04-07,51:48,Unnamed,I’ll look it up for you.
2020-04-07,51:49,Donald Trump,"Okay, let me do somebody else then. Go ahead."
2020-04-07,51:51,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you were highly critical of mail-in voting, mail-in ballots for voting a few minutes ago."
2020-04-07,51:56,Donald Trump,I think mail-in voting in awful. It’s corrupt.
2020-04-07,51:59,Unnamed,"But you voted by mail in Florida’s election last month, didn’t you?"
2020-04-07,52:01,Donald Trump,"Sure, I could vote by mail for-"
2020-04-07,52:04,Unnamed,How do you reconcile that?
2020-04-07,52:04,Donald Trump,"Because I’m allowed to. Well, that’s called out of state. You know why I voted? Because I happen to be in the White House, and I won’t be able to go to Florida and vote."
2020-04-07,52:14,Unnamed,What is the difference between mailing within state or mailing outside the state?
2020-04-07,52:14,Donald Trump,"Well, there’s a big difference between somebody that’s out of state and does a ballot and everything’s sealed, certified, and everything else. You see, what you have to do with the certifications. And you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody’s living room signing ballots all over the place. No, I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing. I think if you vote, you should go. And even the concept of early voting is not the greatest, because a lot of things happen. But it’s okay. But you should go and you should vote. I think you should go and you should vote. You look at what they do where they grabbed thousands of mail-in ballots and they dump it. I’ll tell you what, and I don’t have to tell you. You can look at the statistics. There’s a lot of dishonesty going along with mail-in voting, mail-in ballots. [crosstalk 00:53:03]"
2020-04-07,53:03,Unnamed,"You’ve encouraged state officials to buy their own medical equipment, but federal officials are kind of swooping in and scooping up those orders. How are you ensuring that it’s being distributed fairly and [crosstalk 00:26:15]?"
2020-04-07,53:15,Donald Trump,"That’s not true. Well, we’re getting great prices on equipment. We’re getting great prices on equipment, and we’re helping the states. And the governors are very thankful. Mike Pence had a call yesterday with… every governor was on the call, and it was like a love fest. They’re very happy. I don’t know if they tell that to the press. Some of them don’t. Some of them will never say good to the press, but they know we’ve done a great job. Not a good job, a great job."
2020-04-07,53:37,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:53:37] because state officials are widely saying that.
2020-04-07,53:39,Donald Trump,"No, no, I think sometimes it does. And what we say is let us know, and we will immediately drop out of the bidding. Let us know. And we do that, and we drop out. Sometimes we tell them to drop out because we’ve got a good price. And then we’ll deliver it to them. [crosstalk 00:53:53] Yeah, go ahead. Behind you, please. Go ahead."
2020-04-07,53:56,Unnamed,"Yes. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-07,53:57,Donald Trump,"No, no, no, no. Not you. In front, please. Yeah."
2020-04-07,54:00,Unnamed,Some states have had trouble with getting-
2020-04-07,54:03,Unnamed,Some states have had trouble with getting accurate death counts particularly because of lack of testing or no uniform.
2020-04-07,54:09,Donald Trump,You just said death counts?
2020-04-07,54:09,Unnamed,Yes. Because of lack of testing and no uniform system to put that into.
2020-04-07,54:14,Donald Trump,"I don’t know when you say death counts I think they’re pretty accurate on the death counts. Somebody dies I think the states have been pretty accurate. That’s a big deal what you’re just saying. No, the death counts I think they’re very, very accurate. I do say this, I think if you look at China and if you look at some of these very large countries when you talk about cases, number of cases, I would be willing to bet they have more cases than we do, but they don’t do the testing like we do. But you look at some of these certain countries and I would be willing to bet a lot that they had more cases but we’re more accurate and our testing is done very accurately and we’ve got a good process. Did you have one? Yes, please."
2020-04-07,54:53,Unnamed,Mr president you have been very consistently supportive of the payroll relief tax.
2020-04-07,54:59,Donald Trump,Of what payroll?
2020-04-07,55:01,Unnamed,"Payroll relief. Now, I know you’re still busy trying to implement roll phase three but as we move towards phase four, are there still obstacles to that? Because that would put money in American pockets like consistently."
2020-04-07,55:15,Donald Trump,"Good questions. I would love to see a payroll tax cut and I think on behalf of the people it would be quick. Now it’s a longer term, you know it’s a longer time because it’s over a period of a year or whatever you want to make it. But I would love to see a payroll tax, there are many people that would like to see it as a permanent payroll tax cut."
2020-04-07,55:36,Unnamed,What is stopping it form becoming?
2020-04-07,55:38,Donald Trump,Well the Democrats right now are stopping it.
2020-04-07,55:41,Unnamed,What are their reasons?
2020-04-07,55:43,Donald Trump,"I don’t know if maybe they think it’s good politics to stop it, but you’d get a lot of people a lot of money immediately. The payroll tax cut would be a great thing for this country. I would like to have it regardless of this, but this would be a fantastic time to have the payroll tax cut. The Democrats are stopping it, but I think there’s a certain flexibility. I think it’s something that we should do both for business and the people. But this would get money into the hands of small business immediately, money in the hands of people, the workers and people immediately."
2020-04-07,56:19,Donald Trump,And it would be over an extended period and it would be simple to do. It’s so easy to do. It’s a great tax cut and I’d love you to speak to the Democrats and let’s get it done. So I’m going to give this now to vice president Pence and they’re going to go over some very good statistics with everybody and we’ll have a couple of answers on that because we’re working very hard on the African American community with respect to what’s going on because it’s not good I don’t like it. And we’re going to have some very good statistics Tony I think over the next couple of days. So thank you all very much. Thank you.
2020-04-07,57:06,Mike Pence,"Thank you all a few updates and then I’ll introduce Dr. Deborah Birx to talk about what we’re seeing around the country, what the data is telling us. But suffice it to say as the president said several times, this is a very tough week in America and our hearts go out to all of the families that have lost loved ones to the coronavirus. But I know I speak for the entire white house coronavirus task force when I say our hearts are with the people of the greater New York city area today. As we stand here today in the midst of heartbreaking numbers of losses in New York city, I also want to assure the American people that there’s reason for hope."
2020-04-07,58:02,Mike Pence,"As Dr. Birx will enumerate in just a few moments, despite the increase in losses as governor Cuomo articulated today, hospital admissions continue to decline. And in our report early this morning from Dr. Birx, we continue to see evidence of stabilization in some of the areas around the country of the most significant outbreak, the New York Metro area, including New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut. New Orleans Metro area, Detroit, Boston, Chicago and Denver as Dr. Birx will explain, continue to give evidence of stabilization. Which in a very real sense is evidence that the American people are putting into practice the social distancing, the president’s guidelines for our nation. And for that as the president said earlier today we thank the American people."
2020-04-07,59:12,Mike Pence,"Even in the midst of hardship and loss at a time when we’ve seen more than 385,000 Americans test positive for the coronavirus and more than 12,000 succumb to this illness. The evidence that Dr. Birx will describe to you will show that the American people know our future is in our hands. And so as I begin allow me just simply to continue to urge every American to put into practice the guidance you’re receiving from your state and local authorities. Take it to heart, take it seriously, share it with your family and your friends and know that you’re making a difference America because you truly are. Today for my part, I spoke to over 500 small business owners in a conference call and there I heard about their enthusiasm for the paycheck protection program. And that call took place before the president had the secretary of treasury indicate our interest in acquiring another $250 billion for that program. As of this morning, more than $60 billion in forgivable loans that would cover two months of paychecks with small businesses had already been distributed and the number is going to grow literally by the day."
2020-04-07,01:00:34,Mike Pence,"But we also had a very productive call today with some other American heroes. We all have in our hearts and in our minds our healthcare workers and I’ll speak for a moment about the supplies and resources that we’re working to provide for all of them. But right below our healthcare workers are all the people that are working in critical infrastructure around the country and some of the most important people are working in food supply. I mean from the farmers and the ranchers to our processors, to our distributors, to our truckers, to our grocers. Americans are keeping food on the table for our fellow Americans. And let me begin by just saying what I said to some of the most prominent CEOs of meat and grain industry companies in the country."
2020-04-07,01:01:24,Mike Pence,"Companies like Tyson foods and Hormel today, not just these companies, but to all the hardworking people working in food supply today, thank you. Thank you for what you’re doing to keep those grocery store shelves stocked. Thank you for showing up for work every day and working hard to keep that food supply rolling in America. It was more than five weeks ago that the president brought in all the grocery store leaders in the country and there he received a commitment that no grocery store in America would close and they haven’t. But it’s been these heroic Americans from the farm to the fork that have made it possible for Americans to have one less worry and they are truly inspiring heroes. Now that being said, I did hear from the industry today that there have been reports of some plants having reduced capacity because of people having concerns about exposure to the coronavirus."
2020-04-07,01:02:23,Mike Pence,"In fact over the last several days there’s been some incidents of worker absenteeism and some plants have actually been forced to close temporarily. And so on behalf of the president, on behalf of our entire team and on behalf of a grateful nation, let me just say to all of you that are working in the food industry at every level across the country, just understand that you are vital. You are giving a great service to the people of the United States of America and we need you to continue as a part of what we call our critical infrastructure to show up and do your job. And know that we’re going to continue to work tirelessly working with all of your companies to make sure that that workplace is safe. With that being said let me talk about the other heroes that we always mentioned at this podium today that Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci invariably mentioned that’s our healthcare workers."
2020-04-07,01:03:16,Mike Pence,"At the president’s direction we’ve been working tirelessly, literally around the clock to identify resources around the country and around the world to make sure our healthcare workers have the support that they need. With some 51 major disaster declarations, most recently Minnesota being approved. States have stood up 27,000 national guard, but personnel wise before the end of business today there will be more than 3000 department of defense and health and human service medical personnel on the ground in the greater New York city area. And those people will be redeployed once that region of the country moves through the coronavirus epidemic in that area. And we salute those extraordinary patriotic Americans for stepping forward to bring real relief to our healthcare workers. With regard to equipment, Admiral Polowczyk reported to the task force throughout the course of the day today that we have continued to distribute ventilators across the country. We’re sending additional ventilators from the strategic national stockpile."
2020-04-07,01:04:25,Mike Pence,"Maryland will receive 50 ventilators. Delaware will receive 50 ventilators and that will leave more than 8,400 ventilators still in the national stockpile. One correction from yesterday after our press briefing yesterday, FEMA made a different decision with regard to what the state of California generously made available and the ventilators some 500 ventilators that we again want to thank governor Gavin Newsome and the people of California for donating to our nation’s efforts. 100 of those are being deployed to New York, 100 to New Jersey, 100 to Illinois, 50 to Maryland, 50 to Washington DC, 50 to Delaware and 50 to Nevada. With regard to the remainder of what we call personal protective equipment. Again, we’ve been literally leaving no stone unturned anywhere in the country or anywhere around the world and as Admiral Polowczyk described just a couple of days ago, we’ve established not just an air bridge but a control tower system modeled after military logistics out of FEMA."
2020-04-07,01:05:37,Mike Pence,"And while FEMA is acquiring a small portion of what’s being acquired, 90% of the supplies are being routed directly into our massive distribution system and FEMA is using the data that Dr. Birx provides to target those resources to the areas most in need. I ask them to break out a few details about resources that just in the last five days have been distributed and I hope it’s an encouragement to healthcare workers all across these regions and around the country about the efforts that are being made to make sure they have what they need. You can see the New York Metro area including New Jersey just in the last five days, more than six million N95 masks, more than six million surgical masks. When governor Cuomo and I last spoke, he told me there was a real challenge for medical gowns in the New York city area and in New Jersey as well and 2.8 million gowns were distributed to that region as well."
2020-04-07,01:06:42,Mike Pence,"Going next to New Orleans where again while we see some encouragement, challenges remain in that community. Some 837,000 N95 masks for healthcare workers, 165 surgical masks, other items including almost 6 million gloves have been distributed. Detroit continues to be a real focal point. We’re working closely with governor Gretchen Whitmer as well as mayor Mike Duggan to meet the needs of healthcare workers in Detroit. Just in the last five days 1.6 million N95 masks had been routed into the healthcare system in Detroit, nearly 700,000 surgical masks and 24 million gloves just as a portion of what’s displayed. And in the Chicago Metro area, which we continue to focus on each and every day, more than 1.7 million N95 masks have been routed into their healthcare system, 900,000 surgical masks, 25 million gloves. I share these details in the hopes that healthcare workers looking on will be encouraged."
2020-04-07,01:07:50,Mike Pence,"At the president’s direction we are making every effort to make sure you have the resources you need to do your job, to do it safely and to go home safe to your family even while you provide that extraordinary and courageous care that our healthcare workers are providing literally around the clock in the midst of the coronavirus challenge. The last slide is just the cumulative numbers that we have distributed and I’m happy in a few moments to answer any questions about that. Again, the system that we have in place is one that is essentially infusing our major distribution networks with millions of items and then FEMA is directing on a day by day and oftentimes hour by hour basis where those resources are most needed. And we’ll continue to do that as the coronavirus makes its way through these communities and through communities that are very much on our watch list today."
2020-04-07,01:08:53,Mike Pence,"And let me just lastly say that again I want to thank the American people for stepping up and doing your part. We continue to be overwhelmed with one story after another where people are doing social distancing, where people are looking after one another or where they’re checking in with a phone call to an elderly friend, a family member to make sure they’re okay. I mean we are on the front end of a 30 days to slow the spread and I will tell you as a non-scientist up here that I see glimmers of hope in the early numbers that we’re seeing come out of the greater New York city area, New Jersey, even New Orleans and Detroit and Chicago."
2020-04-07,01:09:36,Mike Pence,"There does appear to be as Dr. Birx Will explain in more detail, it does appear to be evidence of leveling, evidence of progress. But this is exactly the time for all of us to redouble our efforts to do everything each and every one of us can. Not just to protect our own health and that of our family and our loved ones, but to do our part to ensure that we lessen the impact of the coronavirus on America as a whole. But even more importantly that we lessen the impact on lives by ensuring that we do our part to make sure that no one that is vulnerable is unnecessarily exposed to this virus. With that let me yield to Dr. Birx and then Seema Verma and Dr. Fauci and we’ll take all your questions."
2020-04-07,01:10:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr vice president. So hopefully you can see from this numbers that we’ve taken a data detailed approach. Really bringing the power of granular data to the supply chain and moving supplies based on really what you would call burden of disease and need. If I could just start out by not just going to the numbers at the beginning, but really talking to the community of health advocates to the community that works on the social determinants of disease and the communities of the historic black colleges and universities. We really need to improve messaging and I’m asking them to help us increase the messaging around this. We don’t want to give the impression that the African American community is more susceptible to the virus. We don’t have any data that suggests that, what our data suggest is they’re more susceptible to more difficult and severe disease and poor outcomes. And we really need to make sure that every household is aware of what it’s going to take to protect the individuals in that household that have preexisting conditions."
2020-04-07,01:11:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We could call on the indigenous nations, the tribal leaders to also be working very closely to protect the elders of their communities. We know this is more difficult in multi generational households and it’s really going to call for really unbelievable attention to details of hand-washing and protecting others from each other particularly if you don’t feel well. This is really a call to action to the communities to make sure that we get messages appropriately out there so that everyone understands what it’s going to take for us all to protect one another. And we know it can be done because we can see these changes. I wanted to go through the numbers at a high level so you understand why particularly these supplies went to these areas to begin with. We talk about attack rates or the cases poor per population."
2020-04-07,01:12:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So in the New York as a state, they have seven cases per thousand. This is the highest in the country. In New York city itself, it’s closer to most twice that in New York city. New Jersey is four per thousand, Louisiana three per thousand, Massachusetts two per thousand, Connecticut two per thousand, Michigan 1.5 per thousand. The district of Columbia and the Baltimore area now 1.5 per thousand and we’re watching them very closely, Pennsylvania one per thousand but we’re concerned about Philadelphia. What is allowing us to move supplies based on burden of disease and need is the extraordinary West Coast that has had very low numbers from Washington that was less than one per thousand, California that has less than 0.5 per thousand and Oregon that’s even less than that. And it’s those states where there’s large populations because of the enormous work that they’re doing to prevent expansion and spread of the virus. It’s allowing resources to go to these states and these communities and these counties that need more support."
2020-04-07,01:13:35,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so this kind of data analysis is allowing us to make very intelligent decisions about need, but also really understanding what’s happening across the country in the development of the curves as you have heard about. And so we do see and I know you heard me caution that over the weekend sometimes there is decreased case reporting and so there were increases in a series of communities on Monday. We’re seeing that stabilize again and when you look over three days, you’re starting to see that we may be actually in a series of communities outside of New York and New Jersey and Connecticut creating a much flatter graph, a much flatter curve. So you saw New York and the increase and then you saw we’re hoping as governor Como and the mayor has described that they’re getting to a steady state where the next outcome is going down. But we see across the country in Detroit, in Chicago, some real not this extreme going to seven cases per thousand, but really staying in the more two cases per thousand and a different curve parameter then."
2020-04-07,01:14:48,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And it really shows the amazing, amazing activity of every American in those cities to really ensure that there’s social distancing and really importantly to ensure there is less socialization between households and really ensuring that the household really remains independent, protected and not really at this moment going out into the community or socializing anywhere but a virtual way on computers by Zoom, by FaceTime. And I think we can really see that in the data and its really given us great heart. I want to finish by really talking to my laboratory directors because you’re extraordinary and you’ve done an amazing amount of testing. Those nearly 2 million tests that we’re getting to, those were all done in the last two to three weeks, but we do have excess capacity. So if all the lab directors could look in their laboratories if they have an Abbott M2000 if they could get that up and running, we could double the number of tests that we’re doing per day."
2020-04-07,01:15:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That is a high throughput, the machines are throughout the United States, there’s hundreds of them. Right now about 80% of them are idle. We’re going to have a call with the laboratory directors of these laboratories to really ensure this is an automated robotic situation that they can run. There’s over a million test kits sitting ready to be run. We have five platforms of tests. This is one of our really high volume platforms like Roche and we’re really calling on them to really increase that capacity so that we can do not only increased diagnostic testing, which I think we’re doing quite well right now, but also increasing the ability to do more healthcare workers, first responders, community testing and surveillance. And then finally you will see and you’ve heard about it happening in the UK and other places. There’s a series of antibody tests out there that have not been validated."
2020-04-07,01:16:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’re working right now very closely with a series of companies that know how to make these tests that have made these tests for us for decades for HIV, for a rapid test. They’re working on that technology to bring that quality of test, which is in the 90 plus percent sensitivity and specificity to the American people for antibody tests. But until we get those, if you see them on the internet do not buy them until we can give you a test that’s reliable for all Americans. And we are working very hard to have that happen and bring that to the American public. Some of the tests that may be available on the internet may have very low sensitivity and specificity and give you a false reassurance that either give you a false positive or a false negative implying that you may be protected. So please wait until we have those tests available and validated."
2020-04-07,01:17:52,Dr. Deborah Birx,"People are working around the clock to make those available to the American people. We all understand how important that is because you’ve heard us talk about asymptomatic cases and we really want to know how broad that is and how common that is. And so in places like New York city where I described that they had a seven per thousand, sometimes two, three and four times any other place in the United States. Being able to know what the number of people who never had symptoms but do have a positive test would be really critical at this point, particularly as we plan for any reoccurrence in the fall or in future seasons. Thank you."
2020-04-07,01:18:32,Mike Pence,"And we have a Seema Verma with center for Medicaid, Medicare services will discuss what we’ve done to support hospitals. As we support healthcare workers we’re going to make sure the institutions that are providing the environment for care are well financed and she’s got a couple of funding streams and help is on the way, Seema."
2020-04-07,01:18:52,Seema Verma,"Thank you Mr. Vice president, and let me just start with echoing the president and the vice president’s comments about our condolences to all the people out there that have lost somebody to the coronavirus. And also a sincere appreciation and thanks to all our healthcare workers that are on the front lines. But we know that it’s the impact on the healthcare system isn’t just those front care frontline workers, health care organizations across the nation are having increased expenses. They’re having to spend more on supplies. You’re seeing all of the supplies that are being sent to them and that’s having a direct impact on their bottom line. Many of them are also having increased expenses because they’re taking advantage of some of the flexibilities that we’ve given them. Hospitals without walls, they’re putting you may see tents out in their parking lots where they’re doing testing or screening, so they have a lot of increased expenses as well."
2020-04-07,01:19:46,Seema Verma,"Other healthcare organizations are not performing essential surgeries or other services. A lot of them are moving to tele-health and that represents lost revenue for these healthcare organizations across the country. And so the president has asked us to address this issue about 10 days ago, we put out something called accelerated payments that we do in the Medicare program. And it allows us to advance payments to providers based on their historical Medicare revenues that they receive. So just in 10 days we’ve been able to provide payments to providers. We had about 25,000 requests we’ve processed about 70% of these. It’s happened in about five days and the total on that is about $34 billion that we’ve managed to put into the healthcare system. But those are essentially loans."
2020-04-07,01:20:37,Seema Verma,President has asked us to go further with this and to start the implementation of the cares act. That provides $100 billion to the healthcare system. You’ve heard secretary Azar talk about the focus on some of those dollars going towards the uninsured. But the president want us to accelerate getting those dollars out. And so this week we will be putting out another $30 billion which are grants. This is going to be based on Medicare revenue. There are no strings attached.
2020-04-07,01:21:03,Seema Verma,"-is going to be based on Medicare revenue. There are no strings attached, so the healthcare providers that are receiving these dollars can essentially spend that in any way that they see fit. Also, this is going to be done very easy, simplified way for many of our healthcare providers. We actually do direct deposit with them and so those dollars will just go right into their bank accounts. For other providers, all it’s going to require is some very simple registration and we’ll be able to give them that money as well. So we’re expecting that to happen this week."
2020-04-07,01:21:32,Seema Verma,"The other thing to note is that this is not a first come first serve basis because we are basing this on their Medicare revenue. They will get these dollars, so even if it takes a few days, there shouldn’t be any panic in the system as well."
2020-04-07,01:21:45,Seema Verma,"The other thing to recognize here is that our priority was on getting these dollars out as quickly as possible. We heard that from the many healthcare providers across the country that weighed in on this. They said the most important thing was to get these dollars out as quickly as possible. But we recognize that in terms of getting these dollars out because it’s based on Medicare revenues there are providers out there, pediatricians, children’s hospitals, OBGYNs, even our nursing homes that a lot of their revenue comes from other sources, Medicaid or other payer sources. And so those organizations will be addressed in the second tranche of funding and we’ll have a priority for these organizations and these types of healthcare providers."
2020-04-07,01:22:28,Seema Verma,"Also just want to say, so together between the loans that we’ve put out there with our accelerated payments and the $30 billion, that’s about $64 billion for the healthcare system this week alone. And so I think again, this is part of our effort to support the healthcare system, and also just want to again say thank you to all our healthcare providers out on the front lines."
2020-04-07,01:22:49,Seema Verma,To all Americans the best thing that we can do to support our healthcare providers is to adhere to those guidelines around 30 days to slow the spread. That is the best thing that we can do to support our healthcare workers. Thank you.
2020-04-07,01:23:01,Mike Pence,"Dr. Fauci, please."
2020-04-07,01:23:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I just want to make a brief comment to get back to the discussion about the health disparities in the African American community because it really is very important. And the reason I want to bring it up because I couldn’t help sitting there reflecting about sometimes when you’re in the middle of a crisis like we are now with the coronavirus, it really does have ultimately shine a very bright light on some of the real weaknesses and foibles in our society."
2020-04-07,01:23:33,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And as some of you know, the greater proportion of my professional career has been defined by HIV AIDS. And if you go back then during that period of time when there was extraordinary stigma, particularly against the gay community and it was only when the world realized how the gay community responded to this outbreak with incredible courage and dignity and strength and activism that I think that changed some of the stigma against the gay community. Very much so."
2020-04-07,01:24:04,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I see a similarity here because health disparities have always existed for the African American community. But here again with the crisis, how it’s shining a bright light on how unacceptable that is, because yet again, when you have a situation like the coronavirus, they are suffering disproportionately. As Dr. Birx said correctly, it’s not that they’re getting infected more often, it’s that when they do get infected, their underlying medical conditions, the diabetes, the hypertension, the obesity, the asthma, those are the kind of things that wind them up in the ICU and ultimately give them a higher death rate."
2020-04-07,01:24:43,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So when all this is over and as we’ve said it will end, we will get over coronavirus but there will still be health disparities which we really do need to address in the African American community. Thanks. All set"
2020-04-07,01:24:56,Mike Pence,Questions for our panel please?
2020-04-07,01:24:58,Unnamed,"Yeah, Mr. Vice President and then a question for Dr. Birx as well. On the ventilator issue, with 8,400 of them in the stockpile and tens of thousands more coming, why are states like California and Washington needing to send ventilators to other states? Is that smart if they might need them later on?"
2020-04-07,01:25:15,Mike Pence,"Well, I’m going to let Dr. Birx speak about what’s happening in California and Washington because it is a real credit to the people of both states and the leadership of both states to see the progress that we’ve made. We continue to witness that the numbers where the outbreak began, we all remember when this first emerged in the Seattle area. The numbers continue to be steady and low. And what we’ve seen the governor of California do, what we saw the governor of Washington State do and the governor of Oregon where the coronavirus hasn’t arrived to a large extent in Oregon, I think is in keeping with the highest tradition of the American spirit. They are understanding what I think Americans are understanding more and more that while we tend to think of this as one large curve in our minds for when it began in our country and we long for the day that it will end and we want to hasten that day by putting into practice all of these mitigation efforts, that the reality is what these experts have explained to this lay person is that what we’re actually going to witness is a number of small curves that will cumulatively mean that curve."
2020-04-07,01:26:33,Mike Pence,"And for Oregon, for Washington State, for California to recognize where the need is and then to partner with us and FEMA to make sure the resources are there at the time and the need of the point of the need I think is really inspiring. But Dr. Birx, do you want to speak to that?"
2020-04-07,01:26:53,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, I want to be clear. We didn’t ask for their ventilators. Looked at their epidemiologic curves. These states have amazing health commissioners and I think when this is over we’ll really be… All of the models were based on something we have never attempted to do anywhere in the world. We have never attempted to do this kind of mitigation. It was always theoretic to many individuals. And now we see across the globe people mitigating against this virus, realizing that their own behaviors can change the course and future of this virus in their communities, which is really astounding. The power that gives us to actually understand that we can compete against this virus and do well."
2020-04-07,01:27:38,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so I think their governors and their health commissioners looked at their curves, looked at their hospitals, looked at their ICU and looked at their needs and then decided that they didn’t need those at this time and wanted to make it available for other states that were in more of that two per thousand, three per thousand, four per thousand and seven per thousand."
2020-04-07,01:27:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And I think we’ll learn a lot from other states and other communities to really understand how to do this better next time. And I think this is what will teach us because we’ve never attempted anything like this, at least in my lifetime where we’ve had these 30 days to stop the spread. We’ve not ever put out information like that."
2020-04-07,01:28:22,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I think you heard the CDC director talk earlier today about in the models how different individuals thought communities would mitigate and the rate at which they would mitigate. And I think you can see that across the world we’re learning that when you give communities the information that they need to understand what’s going on and you’re transparent, that communities can be part of the solution in a transparent and amazing way. And I think this kind of education and dialogue is always critical when you want communities. I think when I first started here five weeks ago, I said that we will win based on what the communities are able to do as a community of Americans. And I think we’re all really deeply impressed about what they were able to do. So it was the governors who decided."
2020-04-07,01:29:14,Unnamed,The testing backlog. I just had a quick follow-up question on that. How close are we to getting into that 24 hour window you’ve talked about being very important? And then what is the status of the self swab test?
2020-04-07,01:29:25,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’re tracking all of that very closely. I use my time here to appeal to people, specifically the health educators the health advocates, because I know the power with them. But to my lab directors, I really need the Abbot M2000 online because that means we can do an extra hundred thousand tests a day, and there’s enormous power in that."
2020-04-07,01:29:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The the ability to self test, the ability… Last time I had my test here I self-tested. So it can be done. It’s straightforward. It works very well with that rapid five minute test. But what we now have to create, and I know that’s always difficult because everybody wants one of something. We now have to create a mosaic that brings together where we know every single machine is in the United States, where our gaps are and then align resources with need and gaps in the testing and ensure that we have the right laboratory test for the right community. So you can see there would be communities, particularly the Indian Health Service or rural communities where that Abbott ID Now kit could be incredibly helpful because otherwise they’re shipping it all the way to a capital maybe three states away. And that’s going to add two or three days to the wait time, which we’re trying to get away from"
2020-04-07,01:30:54,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:30:54] the backlog two or three days or what would you-
2020-04-07,01:30:56,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It varies state by state and we’ll be talking with all of the states about really changing how we do testing in the community to really ensure that we’re testing optimally. Because right now we have still focused very much on hospital diagnosis because we know it will make a difference in treatment. So these major laboratories are still putting drive thru tests at the back to all the hospital tests. And so that’s where the backlog is, in the drive true tests. So I know if you’re an outpatient, not an inpatient, but if you’re an outpatient, that is where the delays right now are. But it’s state by state. And so some states have 24 hour, 48 hours for both their outpatients and inpatients. Others have short for inpatient and longer and outpatient. And then we’re trying to reconcile those two pieces."
2020-04-07,01:31:50,Mike Pence,"And the team’s actually meeting tonight to review that. But one of the data points that we review is literally on a state by state basis what the turnaround time is for testing, and we continue to work that. And these Abbott Laboratory devices, there’s 18,000 of them across the country. When you go to your doctor office and get a strep test, it’s that device. All Abbott Laboratories has done with strong and swift efforts of the FDA is create a test to put in that for the coronavirus and it’s a 15 minute test. I want to renew our call all the healthcare providers around the country is find your Abbott device and we’ll work our hearts out to get a test to you. How about in the back corner."
2020-04-07,01:32:33,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, thank you. One for you and then one for either of the doctors if you don’t mind. For you, sir, back to this idea of reopening up the economy. It’s not like there’s a switch that you can just turn it back on. How does the administration envision this happening? Is it guidance from the White House and you hope that governors follow it or are you going to put it in the governor’s hands or the mayor’s hands? How do you envision all of that working together?"
2020-04-07,01:32:58,Mike Pence,"Well, the one thing I can assure you is that the president’s decision in that regard is going to be informed by what the data shows and about decisions about when we can responsibly reopen America and put America back to work. I can tell you the CDC will have new guidance tomorrow that the CDC will be publishing for people who were in proximity to an individual that tested positive for coronavirus but have no symptoms. And CDC will be publishing new guidance about how those individuals and the circumstances under which they might be able to return back to work using some facial protection and monitoring their temperature. But we’ll detail that for you."
2020-04-07,01:33:42,Mike Pence,"But what we’re going to be doing over the weeks ahead is while we focus every day at the point of the need, as the president said many times, our first mission is to save lives and that means to slow the spread, bend the curve, to continue to engage the American people, which they are admirably doing to continue to put all the social distancing into practice. But there is a dual track that the president has already initiated. Some of the best minds here at the White House are beginning to think about what recommendations will look like that we give to businesses, that we give to states. But it’ll all, I promise you, be informed on putting the health and well being of the American people first. Dr. Birx."
2020-04-07,01:34:35,Unnamed,"Either for Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci. Do either of you want to take that? Secondly, as a lot of parents are sitting home with their kids and they’ve been home with their kids for weeks now and they’re wondering, maybe resigned to the fact that maybe their kids aren’t going back to school this year but are looking ahead. What do you think summer camp holds and what do you think the startup next school year holds if you could look down the line? Do you think those start on time? Do you think school next year starts on time?"
2020-04-07,01:35:02,Mike Pence,"Can I say a word on behalf of teachers since I’m married to one? My wife was all day yesterday at the elementary school she teaches at loading up about 500 bins of art supplies for kids. And she’s just one of millions of teachers across this country who find themselves having to distance teach kids. And I’m proud of Karen, but related to that I’m proud of every teacher in this country. Secretary of Education was here not long ago talking about our efforts to expand distance learning resources, even in K through 12. To all the teachers who are out there, we just want to say thank you. Thank you for what you’re doing for continuing learning even in this challenging time and to all of the kids, just because you’re home doesn’t mean you don’t to do your schoolwork. Keep it up."
2020-04-07,01:35:53,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:35:53] children be back in class-
2020-04-07,01:35:56,Mike Pence,"What I will tell you is I’ll yield to the health experts, but that’ll be part of what we’re looking at in terms of guidance going forward. Whether it be summer school or whether it be returning to school next fall. But the most important thing we can do is put this epidemic behind us as quickly as possible."
2020-04-07,01:36:17,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"My daughter is a school teacher, so she asked me the same question. It is unpredictable, but you can get a feel for if we start talking about the things where the curve goes down and we really have minimal. How we respond and what kind of a rebound we see or don’t see I think it’s going to have a lot of influence, probably more immediately on things like summer camps than it does in the fall. I fully expect though I’m humble enough to know that I can’t accurately predict that by the time we get to the fall that we will have this under control enough that it certainly will not be the way it is now where people are shutting schools. My optimistic side tells me that we’ll be able to renew to a certain extent, but it’s going to be different. Remember now because this is not going to disappear, so we’re going to have to have in place the capability of doing the things that we talk about all the time on this stage. To identify, to isolate, to contact trace, number one. Number two, by that time we’ll have a better feel with the antibody test about what the actual penetrance of this infection was in society. How many people have actually been infected? Who’s protected? If you have antibodies it’s very likely that you’re protected. Who’s vulnerable? Do you treat vulnerables different than you treat the people who are protected?"
2020-04-07,01:37:42,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"All of these things are going to go into the decision of just how much back to the original way we’d like it to be in the fall. Bottom line is no absolute prediction, but I think we’re going to be in good shape."
2020-04-07,01:37:58,Unnamed,This one’s for Dr. Fauci or Dr. Birx. Can you talk about your concerns about deaths being misreported by coronavirus because of either the testing standards or how they’re characterized.
2020-04-07,01:38:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I think in this country we’ve taken a very liberal approach to mortality and I think the reporting here has been pretty straightforward over the last five to six weeks. Prior to that when there wasn’t testing in January and February, that’s a very different situation and unknown. There are other countries that if you had a preexisting condition and let’s say the virus caused you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem, some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death. Right now we’re still recording it and the great thing about having forms that come in and a form that has the ability to mark it as COVID-19 infection, the intent is right now that if someone dies with COVID-19 we are counting that as a COVID-19 death."
2020-04-07,01:39:18,Unnamed,"Can you be sure, I mean you hear from coroners that that’s not necessarily the case. How can you be confident about that and is there any concern that it skews the data that you’re trying to collect in terms of projections and things like that?"
2020-04-07,01:39:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,I think that would apply more to rural areas that may not have the same level of testing. But I am pretty confident in New York City and New Jersey and places that have these large outbreaks and COVID only hospitals. I can tell you they are testing. New York and New Jersey together have by proportion are testing extraordinary well as Washington State and Louisiana. So I don’t see that there’s been a barrier in testing to diagnosis.
2020-04-07,01:40:00,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I think there’s so much focus now on coronavirus that particularly if you take New York, which we all know is having a disproportionately higher proportion of the burden of the entire country is right now in New York. I can’t imagine if someone comes in with coronavirus goes to an ICU and they have an underlying heart condition and they die, they’re going to say cause of death, heart attack. I cannot see that happening. So I don’t think it’s going to be a problem."
2020-04-07,01:40:31,Mike Pence,How about one more.
2020-04-07,01:40:33,Unnamed,A question for Dr. Fauci on the virus hitting black communities the hardest. I mean these numbers are staggering. Louisiana and other states are reporting 40% to 70% of deaths are African-Americans. Do you expect that pattern to continue nationwide? Some states have not even reported their data yet.
2020-04-07,01:40:53,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I can’t be confident to predict patterns, but the underlying reason why that is happening doesn’t change from state to state."
2020-04-07,01:41:02,Unnamed,So you expect it to get worse.
2020-04-07,01:41:04,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I expect that when African Americans get infected, given the disproportionate disparity of the underlying conditions that lead to complications like the ones I mentioned, I expect that we will still see the pattern that when you look at the proportion of people who get into serious trouble and die, again, it’s going to be disproportionate towards the African-Americans. I do expect that."
2020-04-07,01:41:30,Unnamed,And is the federal government now leading the charge in collecting this information from the states and when will it be made public?
2020-04-07,01:41:36,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yes. The answer is yes, it will be public as soon as you get enough data to be able to make a meaningful statement."
2020-04-07,01:41:42,Unnamed,So can we expect this week or a couple of days?
2020-04-07,01:41:46,Mike Pence,"The taskforce has assigned that to several members of the team, we’re assembling that data now. It is a great concern for us, but it’s probably a good reminder that we have to be especially careful around people with serious underlying health conditions. Because we’ve said it many times from this podium over many weeks, that the risk of serious illness from the coronavirus remains low for the average American."
2020-04-07,01:42:21,Mike Pence,"Before anyone from any community that has a serious underlying health condition, particularly senior citizens with serious underlying health conditions. The risk of tragedy is very real. And so we’re going to be very diligent about studying this and providing information and guidance in accordance with our best scientists."
2020-04-07,01:42:48,Mike Pence,"But I do want to say to each and every American, the president’s coronavirus guidelines for America about wash your hands if you’re sick, stay home. If you can work from home, if you’re not in critical infrastructure, like our incredible healthcare workers or all those heroic people working to keep food on the shelves at our grocery stores and keeping medicine at the pharmacies. We ask you to work from home if you can. Avoid unnecessary travel, avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. Use a drive through at a restaurant. Don’t go in the restaurant."
2020-04-07,01:43:26,Mike Pence,"Not just to protect your health, but to protect those of every community, of every background in this country who may have underlying conditions that make them susceptible to tragic outcomes. That’s how we can all do our part to slow the spread and to protect our most vulnerable. And the American people are doing it. And as we continue to do that, we will hasten the day that we put the coronavirus in the past and we reopen America and put America back to work. Thank you all. We’ll see you tomorrow."
2020-04-08,00:31,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
2020-04-08,00:41,Donald Trump,"This is a holy week when religious believers across the nation will observe Passover, Good Friday, and Easter. Millions of Jewish families begin Passover at sundown tonight, a sacred unbroken tradition that traces back to the ancient land of Egypt. And on Sunday, we celebrate our beautiful, wonderful Easter, which we all look forward to. We’re going to have many Easters together in churches in the future."
2020-04-08,01:13,Donald Trump,"We’re getting closer. You see the numbers. We’re getting much closer to getting our country back to the way it was. We have now an extra two countries that have been attacked, 184. They’re being attacked as we speak, but we’ll all win. At some point, we’re going to all win. We’re going to do it sooner than people think."
2020-04-08,01:35,Donald Trump,"Earlier today, I spoke with 10,000 of America’s faith leaders to thank them for raising the spirits of our people during these very difficult days. While we may be physically apart, we can use this time to pray, to reflect, and to focus on our personal relationship with God."
2020-04-08,01:56,Donald Trump,"I also spoke with more than 3,000 mayors, county commissioners, and state and tribal leaders to provide an update on our administration’s ongoing drive to beat the virus, to crush the virus, and that’s happening. It’s happening, I think, if you look, a little bit more quickly than people thought, maybe a lot more quickly, I hope. It’s something that all over the world we’re watching, but people are watching us and seeing what we’re doing, and they’re very impressed. We’re dealing with many countries right now, many, many countries, and we’re giving them whatever information we’re able to glean."
2020-04-08,02:38,Donald Trump,"I just spoke with the representatives of the UK, and I think that their great prime minister is doing much better today, or at least better. Certainly, he’s had a tough bout, and he’s still going through a tough time, but he seems to be doing better. That’s good. We send our regards to Boris and his family and his friends, all of the people that really love him. He’s become a very popular, before this happened, became a very popular prime minister. He’s doing an excellent job. He loves their country. He loves our country. We appreciate everything he’s done, and hopefully he’s going to be okay."
2020-04-08,03:21,Donald Trump,"Speaking of great people and people that have done a fantastic job, I have Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with us, and I’d like to ask Mike to say a few words. Then I think what we’ll do, in order to get him back to the State Department, we’ll take some questions. We’ll then go on with the rest of what I’m going to say, then we’ll take some questions after that, and then Vice President Pence will take over. Mike Pompeo, please?"
2020-04-08,03:50,Mike Pompeo,"Thank you, Mr. President. Under the president’s leadership, my team and I at the State Department are doing our part to protect the American people from the virus and, importantly, to get them home. As you know, when many countries shut down their rail lines, their buses, their infrastructure systems, the capacity to get out of those countries, they were trapped, they were stranded, and the State Department swung into action."
2020-04-08,04:09,Mike Pompeo,"Since January 29th, we have now repatriated over 50,000 United States citizens back to their homes from more than 90 countries, more than 490 flights back to the United States from all across the world. This worldwide scale of our repatriation efforts is without parallel in our lifetime. We are coordinating with foreign governments, militaries, airport authorities, medical units, transportation companies, hotels. You name it, we’re working with them to make sure the American people get back to be with their families. You can see behind me the map of the flights that we have brought back people from all across the world."
2020-04-08,04:47,Mike Pompeo,"Every day, I get a chance to hear some of the remarkable stories from our team. Let me give you just a couple of examples. Our mission in Peru working with the Peruvian military and police forces to send riverboats up the river to get citizens that were stranded deep inside the Amazon forest. Our mission in Nepal made sure that a woman who was running low on medication could get what she needed at a pharmacy before boarding an evacuation flight that brought her back here. In Honduras, after the government imposed very strict 24/7 curfew and closed airports, our embassy sprang into action for stranded Americans, thousands of them. A three-year-old boy told one of our consular officers just before we boarded the flight, “Thank you for helping me get back home to my dad.” Pretty neat. We have received similar messages from lots of people. They’re proud to know that their country will not leave them stranded and we’re going to get them back home. One woman wrote, “I was in tears when I received the email approving our flight back to the United States. God bless the United States of America.” Another said, “I felt like I had allies there that actually treated me like a person or a family member, not just a number.”"
2020-04-08,05:53,Mike Pompeo,"The repatriation task force at the State Department, our consular officers have done great work. I want to thank our partners in the Department of Defense who have helped with some of these flights back home, and other government agencies, our sisters and brothers across the United States government in this administration that have helped get these people back."
2020-04-08,06:10,Mike Pompeo,"Then, lastly, aside from our repatriation efforts, we continue to help countries around the world as well. We’ve got CDC officials helping these countries with expertise and all the things that these countries need to get their citizens safe and healthy and back so that we can get the economy all across the world, the global economy, back on its feet when this crisis is over."
2020-04-08,06:28,Mike Pompeo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-08,06:28,Donald Trump,"Okay, good. Thanks, Mike. Can you stick for a little while?"
2020-04-08,06:31,Mike Pompeo,Sure.
2020-04-08,06:31,Donald Trump,We’ll see if anybody has any questions for the Secretary of State. Anybody? Please.
2020-04-08,06:36,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, that’s an amazing effort that you have made. How do you know when you’re done? Because I imagine there are Americans on all corners of the world, and someone’s going to pop up and say, “I want to go home now.” When do you get the call that it’s over?"
2020-04-08,06:51,Mike Pompeo,"It’s a great question. We still have several thousand people that we’re working. They identify themselves every day. New people find themselves in a difficult place. Look, we’re going to be done when people can travel on their own again. These people traveled abroad on vacations or with their church and were intending to get back on their own. We hope that day comes pretty soon where they don’t have to rely on the State Department to get them back home."
2020-04-08,07:12,Mike Pompeo,"But know this. In the meantime, we’re devoting all the resources we have to get them. They’re often in difficult places. They’re not in the capital near the airport or the roads are closed, and so it’s not just a matter of getting a flight down there. There’s a lot of work that has to be done to coordinate to make it all happen and get those people available so they’re sitting there when the flight lands, they can get on the plane, and then we can get them back home."
2020-04-08,07:33,Mike Pompeo,"We still have several thousand. We’re working on it. We chip away at that number every day. But new citizens go to the State Department website, identify themselves, and say, “I need a little bit of help in some way,” and we do our best to get that to them just as quickly as we can."
2020-04-08,07:45,Unnamed,So you’ll keep it up indefinitely.
2020-04-08,07:46,Mike Pompeo,We’re going to keep it up as long as we have resources to do it and there is a need.
2020-04-08,07:50,Mike Pompeo,"Yes, sir?"
2020-04-08,07:52,Unnamed,"How many of these staffers have tested positive for coronavirus? Have they been tested? Are they going into quarantine? And what does this do to diplomatic efforts overseas if you’re pulling 50,000 people out of national capitals, nation capitals all over the world?"
2020-04-08,08:08,Mike Pompeo,"The vast majority of these 50,000 weren’t our officers. These were ordinary citizens who were there traveling for business or for commercial or for their trip of a lifetime. We’ve seen some of that on the cruise ships, but of course they’re stranded all over the world."
2020-04-08,08:22,Mike Pompeo,"Our embassies, save for the one that is in Wuhan, which we did pull everybody out of, the rest of our facilities around the world are all open. We’ve had a handful of our folks now test positive, but we feel like we have a good handle on it. We’re doing everything we can to make sure that not just the State Department officers, but our Department of Defense colleagues that are working on these missions as well, are doing so in a way that reduces risk to them and their well-being also."
2020-04-08,08:45,Mike Pompeo,"Yes, ma’am?"
2020-04-08,08:46,Unnamed,"Thank you so much. Do you feel like China withheld critical information from the United States, and will there be any consequences for that?"
2020-04-08,08:53,Mike Pompeo,"This is not the time for retribution, but it is still the time for clarity and transparency. We’re still working on this problem set. There’s still data that these good people need so that they can perform their analysis of how to both develop therapeutics and a vaccine and to understand where this virus is."
2020-04-08,09:14,Mike Pompeo,"Every country, China included, every country needs to be transparent about what’s gone on in their country. They need to share that data. We share ours with the world, so that the best scientists in the world can get to the right conclusions and bring this economy, this global economy back to the place that we all want it to be as quickly as we can. Every country has that responsibility."
2020-04-08,09:32,Mike Pompeo,"It started in China, and so they had that special responsibility to get it right quickly and fast. I ask every country, as we move forward in the days and weeks ahead, make sure we share that. Do it right. Do it well. When we do, we’ll get this thing back on."
2020-04-08,09:44,Unnamed,"But early on, should they have shared their data sooner with the United States?"
2020-04-08,09:47,Mike Pompeo,"Every country has an obligation to share that information accurately, timely, completely, transparently, and thoroughly, just as quickly as they can gather it. We’ll leave for another time to evaluate how everyone did in that."
2020-04-08,09:58,Donald Trump,Go ahead [crosstalk 00:09:59].
2020-04-08,10:01,Unnamed,"Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. Secretary, I have a question. The World Health Organization has a fundraising drive for $700 million for coronavirus resources. China has only donated 20 million. The United States actually has donated less. Do you feel that China should be giving more to this World Health Organization effort? And comments on the U.S. donation?"
2020-04-08,10:22,Mike Pompeo,"You want to say something, Mr. President?"
2020-04-08,10:23,Donald Trump,"Well, you could just say we held."
2020-04-08,10:25,Mike Pompeo,"At this point, we’re reevaluating our funding with respect to the World Health Organization. This is very consistent with what President Trump said since the beginning of his campaign. Organizations have to work. They have to deliver the outcomes for which they were intended. We need to make sure that not only the World Health Organization, but every international organization that we take taxpayer money and give it to them for the benefit of America, we need to make sure it’s delivering on those taxpayer dollars."
2020-04-08,10:53,Mike Pompeo,"The World Health organization is no different in that respect. They have to execute on the mission that they are designed to achieve. We’ve seen with respect to the World Health Organization, here we are. It hasn’t accomplished what it was intended to deliver."
2020-04-08,11:10,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, you said a handful of staffers have tested positive. Are they going to get the hydroxychloroquine treatment? Is that going to be made available to personnel overseas?"
2020-04-08,11:21,Mike Pompeo,"I don’t know the answer to that, but know that we’ll deliver the best medical care everyplace we can. Some of them are in difficult places where there’s not a lot of medical help, and we’ve done our best to move that medical assistance forward to them in the field."
2020-04-08,11:35,Donald Trump,Jeff?
2020-04-08,11:36,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Mr. Secretary? Right here. Can you give us an update on numbers you’re seeing about coronavirus cases in Iran, and whether or not you have any updates on the United States helping them with that?"
2020-04-08,11:48,Mike Pompeo,"With respect to our assistance to Iran, we have offered, from the first day we knew that the virus had struck the people of Iran, we offered humanitarian assistance. I regret that they chose not to take that. I’ve heard people talking about sanctions. The world should know there are no sanctions that prevent humanitarian assistance, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals from going to Iran. We offered American assistance. We’ve tried to help other countries get assistance in there as well. We’ve had some ability to do that. I don’t have any better data than what you’ve seen publicly that I can share with you with respect to the extent of the virus inside of Iran."
2020-04-08,12:22,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Are you allowing exports of medical supplies at this time, or what’s the status of that?"
2020-04-08,12:29,Mike Pompeo,"You’ve seen, we’re making sure that we have what we need for the American people, whether that’s gloves… I’ll let the vice president talk to numbers on that. But at this point, what we are doing in terms of assistance is providing what most of these countries need to learn how to do surveillance themselves, to learn how to conduct tests themselves, to learn the things that can reduce the peak in their countries. Those are the kind of things."
2020-04-08,12:50,Mike Pompeo,"We’ve been doing this… You should know the United States has been incredibly generous. We have CDC officials, like no other country in the world, out helping these nations build out their healthcare, global epidemic healthcare infrastructure. It’s good people like that you see sitting to my right that have been working on this all their life, all around the world, putting these countries in a place where they’re better prepared for a virus like this one."
2020-04-08,13:13,Unnamed,Have any U.S. diplomats or U.S. officials contracted the virus as they’ve tried to rescue U.S. citizens abroad?
2020-04-08,13:21,Mike Pompeo,"Not that I’m aware of. Not that I’m aware of, but there’s no doubt… I remember when we sent our team to get our officials and about 800 American non-government citizens that were living in Wuhan, I remember when we sent one of our first repatriation flights in there, we were very careful. We sent trained professionals in, but they were going into a very, very difficult, very fraught place. We were blessed; they all got back with no one having contracted the virus on that trip."
2020-04-08,13:46,Mike Pompeo,"I’m not aware of any of our officials that have had the virus attack them while they were performing their functions trying to get people back. We have a number of State Department officials who have COVID-19 now and are working their way through. In fact, we’ve had three fatalities of local employees, not U.S. direct hires, but local people who were working for the State Department in embassies around the world. We’ve had three fatalities so far."
2020-04-08,14:13,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-04-08,14:13,Unnamed,"There have been some calls on the World Health Organization for a leadership change there. I was wondering what your thoughts are on that. Senator Martha McSally, for example, has called for Dr. Tedros to resign."
2020-04-08,14:27,Mike Pompeo,"I don’t want to… Look, this is not the time to be doing that kind of change. There’ll be a lot of time to look back and see how the World Health Organization performed. In the meantime, what our task is is to preserve and protect the American taxpayers to make sure that our resources don’t go to places that aren’t going to deliver on behalf of the American people and the world. President Trump and I are determined to do that."
2020-04-08,14:50,Unnamed,Just a quick follow-up?
2020-04-08,14:50,Donald Trump,Let’s save it. Can we save it?
2020-04-08,14:52,Unnamed,Just a quick follow-up. May I-
2020-04-08,14:56,Donald Trump,He’s a busy man.
2020-04-08,14:57,Unnamed,You said that China has a responsibility to get correct figures. How would you broadly characterize cooperation with China right now?
2020-04-08,15:06,Mike Pompeo,"With lots of places, we’ve been cooperating. They’re providing us assistance where we need it. There are places on the ground now where we do have access to the data we need, and we’re deeply appreciative of that. They’ve said they want to cooperate. We’re completely prepared to cooperate with them. That cooperation means sharing data, being transparent, being upfront, allowing information to flow freely. That’s our expectation, not just of China, though, of every country that is in this place today. Collectively, we have to work our way through this, and to do that, you have to have really good data."
2020-04-08,15:39,Donald Trump,"Okay. Thank you, Mike. Thank you."
2020-04-08,15:40,Mike Pompeo,"Great. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
2020-04-08,15:43,Donald Trump,Appreciate it. Thanks.
2020-04-08,15:46,Mike Pompeo,"Okay, thank you very much. In just a few days, we’ve delivered nearly 11 million N95 masks to hot spots around the country, as you know, including 6.6 million to New York and New Jersey, 1.8 million to Chicago, 1.7 million to Detroit, and 837,000 to New Orleans."
2020-04-08,16:07,Mike Pompeo,"I spoke with the governor of Louisiana a little while ago, and they’re doing really pretty well, much better than they thought. They’ll be using fewer beds. As you know, we built a hospital. We’re about set to complete another hospital, and there’s even a possibility they won’t need it. That’s what we discussed."
2020-04-08,16:26,Mike Pompeo,"To date, we’ve shipped out more than 8, 000 ventilators, and we have almost 10,000 sitting there ready to go should we need them. An additional 2,200 newly manufactured ventilators come online on Monday. We’re going to be sending them to various locations just in case they need them."
2020-04-08,16:47,Mike Pompeo,"My administration is working with Philips to double their production of ventilators by May, and ultimately quadruple production by later this year, high-quality ventilators. We’re eliminating bureaucratic barriers to pave the way for Philips, major investments in American manufacturing sites and sales. This will help to ensure that our country can permanently produce enough ventilators in the future that we can do them by ourselves."
2020-04-08,17:15,Mike Pompeo,"We’re going to have a big stockpile when we’re finished, and we expect to be sending quite a few to other countries to help them after we’re finished. Even now, a couple of countries are really, really in dire need. It looks like our projections were right on ventilators. Some states that were thinking they would need thousands of more than they thought are now already taken care of, which we’re very happy about."
2020-04-08,17:43,Mike Pompeo,"In addition, beginning in May, we’ll be receiving almost 300 million new face masks. We’re going to have masks of about 300 million. They’ll be starting to be delivered in May and during the month of June. We’re ordering a big stockpile. We’re thinking about doing an extra 200 million, should we need them, or for the stockpile, so we’ll be in a position to have something incredible. That’ll be a total of 500 million masks."
2020-04-08,18:17,Mike Pompeo,"Today, 750,000 new protective gowns landed in Dallas, Texas, as a result of a partnership led by the federal government, DuPont, and FedEx. That’s been a great partnership. That’s worked very well. We have 750,000 new protective gowns, and these are at a high level, very high quality."
2020-04-08,18:37,Mike Pompeo,"As American industry steps up to help, so are America’s doctors and scientists. 10 drugs are now in clinical trials, and my administration is taking unprecedented actions to make new therapies and treatments available without delay. The doctors, the lab technicians, the companies, I spoke to them yesterday. I spoke again today. They are coming up with things that are, I think, I hope, in the very near future are going to be very, very special, very important."
2020-04-08,19:09,Mike Pompeo,"Our national stockpile is now equipped with nearly 30 million hydroxychloroquine pills, so we’re up to about 30 million. We’re distributing them by the millions. You read about State Representative Karen Whitsett, who I very much appreciate her going public. She was, I think, very, very much helped by this pill. She saw what I was saying on television. She thought she was in very bad shape. I don’t want to go further than that. But you see her story. You know her story. She’s a highly respected state rep from Michigan, and I think she did a great service, what she’s done. She’s in terrific shape. She looks fantastic, and she was very generous with her statements. In addition, the azithromycin and zinc. They say zinc; we should add zinc now. This all has to be recommended by doctors, physicians, but they say zinc. I want to throw that out there, because that’s where they seem to be having the best result. You add the zinc and the azithromycin, and we’ve had a lot of good stories. We’ve got a lot of good stories. We have almost 30 million doses, so we’ve got a lot. I want to thank Prime Minister Modi of India for allowing us to have what we requested from before the problem arose, and he was terrific. We’ll remember it."
2020-04-08,20:48,Mike Pompeo,"Later today, the CDC will release further guidance to help ensure critical infrastructure workers can perform their job safely after potential exposure to the virus. They’re working on that."
2020-04-08,21:01,Mike Pompeo,"The question was asked a little while ago about the World Health Organization. As you know, they made a statement on January 14th, I guess it was, that there was no human-to-human transmission. Well, there was. They probably made that statement in the second or third week of December, in addition, but they made it very powerfully on January 14th. They criticized me very strongly when I said that we’re going to shut down flights coming in from China, and especially from certain parts of China, but from China generally. We were criticized very badly."
2020-04-08,21:40,Mike Pompeo,"Last year, and for many years, hundreds of millions of dollars has been paid to the World Health Organization, hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Last year was $452 million, and China paid $42 million. Before that, it was $500 million, and China paid less than $40 million. Before that, it was similar numbers, in the 400s, 300s, and sometimes even in the 500s of millions of dollars, and China would do proportionally just a small fraction of that number."
2020-04-08,22:22,Mike Pompeo,"I think they have to get their priorities right. Their priorities are that everybody has to be treated properly, every country, and it doesn’t seem that way, does it? Doesn’t seem that way. So we’re going to do study, investigation, and we’re going to make a determination as to what we’re doing. In the meantime, we’re holding back. We want to see. Very unfair."
2020-04-08,22:46,Mike Pompeo,"The United States, $452 million compared to $42 million. That’s to the World Health Organization. That’s not good. That’s not good. Not fair. Not fair at all. Other countries, as you know, also gave very substantially less than the United States."
2020-04-08,23:07,Mike Pompeo,"The WHO, World Health, got it wrong. They got it very wrong. In many ways, they were wrong. They also minimized the threat very strongly. Not good."
2020-04-08,23:21,Mike Pompeo,"I want to take this opportunity to express the thanks of an extremely grateful nation to the Americans who go to work every day, especially in these critical industries in the midst of the pandemic, to care for and protect and feed American people, including medical personnel, law enforcement, first responders, food suppliers, sanitation workers. Somebody mentioned today, would you please specifically call out cashiers and clerks at grocery stores who are in during the pandemic, during the epidemic? They’re in danger. They are really in great danger. They’ve been incredible, and I want to call them out, cashiers and clerks."
2020-04-08,24:08,Mike Pompeo,"We grew up with cashiers and clerks in grocery stores, and they’ve been great. They’ve really been true American heroes. I want to call them out, because they’re working hard and they’re working in conditions that aren’t ideal. But soon, they’ll be ideal again."
2020-04-08,24:23,Mike Pompeo,"As we mourn the terrible loss of life from this grave pandemic, we’re seeing signs that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread is working. The number of new cases is stabilizing. The number of beds necessary in so many locations… I was watching, this morning, New York. I was watching Louisiana. You see what’s going on. The numbers are changing, and they’re changing rapidly. Soon we’ll be over that curve. We’ll be over the top, and we’ll be headed in the right direction. I feel strongly about that."
2020-04-08,24:59,Mike Pompeo,"Some terrible days ahead, but we’re going to have some wonderful days ahead. We’re going to get this behind us, this terrible thing behind us. Some people will never be able to forget, if they had a loved one, if they had a great friend or a friend, but we’re going to get it behind us."
2020-04-08,25:17,Mike Pompeo,"This is a tribute to the discipline and the devotion of the American people, what we’ve accomplished. If every American continues to strictly adhere to social distancing guidelines, we can defeat the invisible enemy and save countless lives, and we can do it much more quickly. We are hopefully heading toward a final stretch, the light at the end of the tunnel, as I was saying."
2020-04-08,25:42,Mike Pompeo,"As we continue to wage all-out medical war to defeat the virus, we’re also fighting an economic war to ensure we can quickly turn to full financial strength. We have to get our country back. We have to get going. Everybody wants to get going."
2020-04-08,25:59,Mike Pompeo,"Yesterday, I asked Congress to provide an additional $250 billion to expand the incredibly successful Paycheck Protection Program. You’ve seen what’s gone on there. It’s incredible, actually, which is allowing our small businesses to keep employees on the payroll and get ready for the opening, like a second opening."
2020-04-08,26:18,Mike Pompeo,"To protect millions of American jobs, I’m asking Congress to pass additional funding for this program this week as soon as possible. I think we have pretty good understanding with the Democrats. Hopefully, it’s going to be bipartisan. We do not have time for the partisan games, and we don’t want that, the obstruction or totally unrelated agendas. We want to do this for the small businesses and the workers. We can do a phase four, and a phase four will be later. This will be an expansion of what we’ve already done because it’s so successful. The $350 billion will be expanded by, hopefully, 250. If you look at the kind of loans, tens of thousands of loans to small businesses, it’s a great thing to see."
2020-04-08,27:03,Donald Trump,"… Owns the small businesses. It’s a great thing to see, it’s turned out to be more successful and more productive than anybody would have thought. But Democrats and Republicans are coming together to get that job done. That’s a very important job, in recent days and days ahead will restore America’s health and economic might, but also dimensions of our national strength will be brought together I think stronger than… I think we have a chance to be stronger than ever before. We’ve learned a lot. And we have tremendous stimulus now. Tremendous stimulus. And we’re going for more. Hopefully we’ll be doing an infrastructure bill so we can rebuild our roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and all of the things that we should be doing for our country."
2020-04-08,27:46,Donald Trump,"We’re going to rebuild our country, not other countries where they don’t even appreciate it. As our citizens persevere through this present challenge we’re renewing American unity, and we’re replenishing American will, and we are witnessing new American valor each and every day. We see it every day. The daring and determination of our people in this crisis reminds us that no matter how hard it gets, no matter what obstacles we must overcome, Americans will keep on fighting to victory and we will secure the glorious future that our citizens so richly deserve, especially after going through this nightmare, this evil beast. So we’re getting very close and hopefully it’s on the other side, and it will end soon, and I think it will. And I just think that the people of this country are fantastic. So we’ll take a few questions and then Vice President will take over. Please, go ahead. Please."
2020-04-08,28:48,Unnamed,"Thank you so much Mr. President. ABC is reporting that your intelligent committee was warning about the virus as early as November, and produced a detailed report about the outbreak in China. When did you first learn about the intelligence and could you have acted on it then?"
2020-04-08,29:02,Donald Trump,"Well, when I learned about the gravity of it was sometime just prior to closing the country to China. And when we closed up the flights coming in from China and various other elements. And then as you know, we closed up to Europe. So I don’t know exactly, but I’d like to see the information. Yeah. Please, please."
2020-04-08,29:22,Unnamed,"Mr. President, a lot of Americans want to see businesses reopened-"
2020-04-08,29:24,Donald Trump,Yep. So do I. More than anybody.
2020-04-08,29:27,Unnamed,So what specifically has to happen for you to feel that it’s safe to reopen the country and what is your plan to do that?
2020-04-08,29:33,Donald Trump,"I think we can say that we have to be on that downside of that slope and heading to a very strong direction that this thing has gone. And we could do it in phases. We can go to some areas which you know, some areas are much less effective than others. But it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country or certainly most of our country. And I think we’re going to do that soon. You look at what’s happening. I would say we’re ahead of schedule now. You hate to say it too loudly, because all of a sudden things don’t happen. But I think we will be sooner rather than later. But we’ll be sitting down with the professionals. We’ll be sitting down with many different people and making a determination and those meetings will start taking place fairly soon."
2020-04-08,30:14,Unnamed,So you wouldn’t do that until the health experts tell you it’s safe to do it?
2020-04-08,30:18,Donald Trump,"Yeah, would rely very heavily on them. Yeah."
2020-04-08,30:20,Unnamed,Do you think there is a system for monitoring and testing that you’re looking at?
2020-04-08,30:26,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we’re putting in very heavy testing systems. We have the best testing systems. And again, don’t forget when we look at cases, I’m looking at some… I’m not going to insult anybody. I’m not going to insult any country. But I’m looking at countries that are showing less cases than us. That’s testing. We’re testing more than anybody. And you saw exponentially more than anybody by far. And our testing’s become, I think it’ll end up being a big strength. And in fact, the other countries, other countries that the media talked about, are now calling us for what are we doing, and how are we doing it so quickly, and where are we getting these tests? Because our tests are really good now. They’ve been proven to be very accurate. Yes, please."
2020-04-08,31:08,Unnamed,"Thank you, President Trump. I have two quick questions. One on infrastructure. The members of your administration and members of Congress have pointed out the top paid federal employee. It’s not the president, it’s the head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and he made $8 million last year and some."
2020-04-08,31:23,Donald Trump,"It’s ridiculous. I agree. It’s ridiculous. I think it’s the highest paid government. Long before I got here. You said Tennessee Valley Authority, right? Has to be the highest paid man in any government. Makes approximately $8 or $9 million. I don’t know the gentleman, but he’s got a heck of a job. He gets paid a lot of money. He’s been there for a long while, hasn’t he?"
2020-04-08,31:46,Unnamed,"This one actually is new. He came in April, but the previous election-"
2020-04-08,31:49,Donald Trump,"That’s a separate. Yeah, that’s separate, but I’m talking about we just have some new people going on the board, I know. But as you know, that’s a quasi public agency and whoever the head of the agency is, that person makes a lot of money."
2020-04-08,32:05,Unnamed,If I could ask my second question-
2020-04-08,32:07,Donald Trump,"Which is an amazing thing. And when do we want them to do something, they’re not there for us. That’s not good. That’s not good."
2020-04-08,32:15,Unnamed,The second question-
2020-04-08,32:15,Donald Trump,They’ve been there for a long time. That’s been a story for a long time.
2020-04-08,32:19,Unnamed,And I assume that you would support reducing that salary part of the infrastructure bill?
2020-04-08,32:23,Donald Trump,Yep. Reducing it by a lot.
2020-04-08,32:26,Unnamed,My other question is-
2020-04-08,32:27,Donald Trump,"Only the greatest job in the history of government though, most certainly if you’re into money. Tennessee Valley Authority. It’s right. Go ahead. I’ve been waiting for somebody to ask me about that. It’s been bothering me for a long time to go ahead."
2020-04-08,32:41,Unnamed,"So one of the biggest rating hits of the coronavirus is, aside from these briefings, has been a show on Netflix called Tiger King. And the man who’s the star of this was a former zoo owner who’s serving a 22 year prison sentence. He’s asking you for a part in saying he was unfairly convicted. Your son yesterday jokingly said that he was going to advocate for it. And I was wondering if you’ve seen show, if you have any thoughts on pardoning Joe Exotic?"
2020-04-08,33:06,Donald Trump,Which son? It must be Don.
2020-04-08,33:08,Unnamed,It was.
2020-04-08,33:08,Donald Trump,I had a feeling it was done. Is that what he said? I don’t know. I know nothing about it. His 22 years? For what? What did he do?
2020-04-08,33:15,Unnamed,"He allegedly hired someone to murder an animal rights activist, but he said that he didn’t do that and he was-"
2020-04-08,33:21,Donald Trump,You think he didn’t do it? Are you on his side? Are you recommending a pardon?
2020-04-08,33:26,Unnamed,"No, I’m not advocating anything yet."
2020-04-08,33:27,Donald Trump,"As a reporter, you’re not allowed to do that. You’d be criticized by these. Would you recommend a pardon?"
2020-04-08,33:33,Jim Acosta,I’m not weighing in on Tiger King.
2020-04-08,33:35,Donald Trump,I don’t think you would. Go ahead. Do you have a question?
2020-04-08,33:36,Jim Acosta,But I do like Joe Exotic.
2020-04-08,33:37,Donald Trump,I’ll take a look. Is that Joe Exotic? That’s Joe Exotic?
2020-04-08,33:41,Jim Acosta,"Let me get back to you with the coronavirus, if I can, Mr. President. Last week, your top experts were saying that we should expect 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in this country. You’ve been talking about how it looks like maybe things are planned telling. Are these numbers now being revised downward? I know you don’t want people to stop social distancing and that sort of thing, but what can you tell us about the numbers? Are they right?"
2020-04-08,34:04,Donald Trump,"Yeah. My impression Jim, is those were the numbers that were set. And they were set as an expectation from quite a while ago. I think we’re just doing much better than those numbers. If either of you would like to talk about that, it’s a fair question. Do you want to come up, Deborah?"
2020-04-08,34:24,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, so I think all of you, many of you have done the analysis of the same models that we utilized. And if you do the models of the models, you end up with that range. At the same time, we’ve carefully looked at Italy and Spain. And we are doing much better in many cases than several other countries. And we’re trying to understand that. We believe that our healthcare delivery system in the United States is quite extraordinary. I know many of you are watching the Act Now model, and the IMHE model. And they have consistently decreased the number, the mortality, from over almost 90,000 or 86,000, down to 81,000, and now down to 61,000."
2020-04-08,35:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That is modeled on what America is doing. That’s what’s happening. And I think what has been so remarkable, I think, to those of us who have been in the science fields for so long is how important behavioral change is, and how amazing Americans are in adapting to and following through on these behavioral changes. And that’s what’s changing the rate of new cases, and that’s what will change the mortality going forward. Because now we’re in to the time period of full mitigation that should be reflected within the coming weeks of decreasing mortality."
2020-04-08,35:48,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I mean that’s what we really hope to see. We are impressed by the American people. And I think models are models. I’ve always worked on validating. I spent my life validating models all over the world and that’s why we do surveys and surveillance, and we make sure that what we think is right. I think this will change how people look at respiratory diseases, because it will change what is possible when the globe, and particularly the American people, do this level of mitigation. And I think as I talked about yesterday, we are still in awe really of the American people’s strength in this and following through."
2020-04-08,36:32,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I’m going to do that. I’m going to ask Bob to come up just for a second, Director. I think that’s it. They have done it. Everybody has done everybody a great job. So those were original projections. And we don’t want to say anything about beating it yet, but I think we will have a very good chance to beat and I’m very substantial about this."
2020-04-08,36:54,Robert Redfield,"Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to add to what Ambassador Birx said. I mean, this is a consequence of the commitment of the American people. And a lot of us have always had challenges changing behavior, whether if it’s exercising regularly or different habits with smoking and when it affects us. What’s been remarkable to watch here, is how the American public has changed their behavior when it protects the vulnerable. I think that’s really what I’m so proud to see."
2020-04-08,37:25,Unnamed,"Mr. President, just a followup on something from yesterday, a quick just yes or no question. Yesterday you said you had not seen Peter Navarro’s memo on the coronavirus back in January, February 23rd. Were you ever reached on those memos? Did you ever discuss those memos with anybody?"
2020-04-08,37:42,Donald Trump,"I don’t remember that. I’ve now seen the memo. I saw it. Peter sends a lot of memos. I didn’t see the memo. As you know, World Health was saying that was not correct because at the time they called it wrong. But I didn’t see the memo. But I acted as quickly as… People were shocked that I acted so quickly and everybody thought I was wrong because I did act so quickly as you know, with respect to closing the borders. With respect not only to China, but with Europe, I closed the borders. And I think that was very important. But no, I didn’t see the memo at the time, but I have seen it since. Yeah, please. Wait a minute, let me do a couple of others. We’ll go back."
2020-04-08,38:19,Unnamed,They head of the World Health Organization today warned against politicizing.
2020-04-08,38:23,Donald Trump,I agree with that.
2020-04-08,38:24,Unnamed,"And he said that consequence of politicization could actually create more body bags, it was a pretty vivid image. What do you believe the consequence of the US pulling out its funding of the WHO?"
2020-04-08,38:37,Donald Trump,"Well, I think when you say more body bags, I think we would have done… And he would have been much better serving the people that he’s supposed to serve if they gave a correct analysis. I mean everything was, I said, China-centric. Everything was going to be fine. No human to human, keep the borders open. He wanted me to keep the borders open. I closed the borders despite him. And that was a hard decision to make at the time. We’re all together. We made a decision against the World Health Organization. So when he says politicizing, he’s politicizing. That shouldn’t be. But look, we spend $450 billion, $452 billion, almost $500 billion last year. Hundreds of billions in previous years. And they got to do better than that. They got to do better. When you talk about politics, I can’t believe he’s talking about politics. When look at the relationship they have to China. So China spends $42 million, we spend $450 million, and everything seems to be China’s way. That’s not right. It’s not fair to us, and honestly it’s not fair to the world. Okay question in the back. Yeah."
2020-04-08,39:49,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. There’s breaking news today in a couple of reports from a couple of different outlets that Jared Kushner’s team is seeking to create a national coronavirus database, a tracking system for patients who’ve been diagnosed. Now his spokesperson said that that’s not true."
2020-04-08,40:07,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I have never heard about it. It doesn’t sound like a bad idea actually, but I have not heard about that."
2020-04-08,40:12,Unnamed,You would be okay with it?
2020-04-08,40:13,Donald Trump,"I don’t know if I’d be okay. I have to see it. But it sounds very scientific and it sounds like it could be good based on tracking, but it also has to do with rights and lots of different constitutional questions. I have not heard that at all."
2020-04-08,40:27,Unnamed,Okay. So some people are concerned it would be like the post 9/11 Patriot Act that ultimately led to the FISA abuse. Are you concerned about that?
2020-04-08,40:36,Donald Trump,"FISA abuse, which I was the one abused. And a couple of other people, in all fairness. No, I don’t know anything about it. I haven’t heard it. I mean, I’ll speak to them. I don’t think so. They would have told me. I would’ve known about it. Please."
2020-04-08,40:48,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. The Nevada delegation is unhappy, because smaller casinos and businesses that make a profit from gaming-"
2020-04-08,40:58,Donald Trump,In Nevada?
2020-04-08,40:58,Unnamed,"In Nevada. Found out they’re not eligible for the CARES Act, PPP money. And I talked to one member who said gaming-"
2020-04-08,41:08,Donald Trump,You mean because of the number of employees?
2020-04-08,41:11,Unnamed,Because of the number of employees-
2020-04-08,41:12,Donald Trump,And yet they’re small businesses.
2020-04-08,41:13,Unnamed,And they thought gaming would not be treated any differently than any other business with this. Was this an oversight?
2020-04-08,41:19,Donald Trump,"Well, I could look at that. I could look. It’s a great state and I will take a look at that strongly. Are you talking only the smaller casinos?"
2020-04-08,41:27,Unnamed,Yes.
2020-04-08,41:27,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I’ll take a look at that. Fine. I don’t mind that. Please. Yeah, we’ll take a look. Yeah, we haven’t heard, nobody’s told me about it, but I’ll look at it. It’s a great state. They do a great job, so I’m going to look at it very strongly. I understand what they mean. Please."
2020-04-08,41:42,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. In terms of the economy, what if you urge Americans to go back to work and they don’t listen to you? Would you leave that up to the governors, to businesses, to citizens to decide when it’s safe to stop social distance thing?"
2020-04-08,41:56,Donald Trump,"Well, when you say they don’t listen, I think they are going to listen. They want to go back. Everybody wants to, they’re going stir crazy. They’ve been in those houses and those apartments and I mean, they’ve done a great job. Again, when you look, the question was just asked about how are we doing compared to projections. Those were just original projections. The big projection being 2.2 million people would die if we did nothing. That was another decision we made, close it up. That was a big decision that we made."
2020-04-08,42:25,Donald Trump,"Two very smart people walked into my office and they said, “Listen, these are your alternatives,” and that was a projection of I guess 1.5 to 2.2 million people would die if We didn’t close it up. That’s a lot of people. So if we do a number that’s tremendously smaller than that, now, if we did close it up, the numbers got to 100 to 220 million people. So if we can stay substantially under the 100, which was the original projection, I think we all did a very good job. Even though it’s a lot of people. Say it."
2020-04-08,42:59,Unnamed,Do you think we’re on track for that by May 1st?
2020-04-08,43:01,Donald Trump,"Okay, well right now we’re, I mean we’re doing well in terms of the numbers. I can’t tell you in terms of the date. We don’t want to go down, and then we can start going up if we’re not careful. So we have to be careful. As far as a distancing, social distancing, and other things, certainly for a while. At some point, that’s going away. We’ll be able to sit next to each other and we have all our lives. This is a very unique thing. This has not happened, anything like this of this magnitude, since 1917, 1918. The Great Pandemic. That was something."
2020-04-08,43:37,Donald Trump,"But yeah, no, people want to sit next to each other at restaurants. They want to sit next to each other like normal at a football game, baseball game, basketball game, hockey game. No, we want to go back to life. Now, the first period of time, maybe we’ll go a little bit slower and maybe we’ll be talking about distancing. But at some point, we expect to be back like it was before. And hopefully it’ll never happen. Hopefully if it does happen, it’s going to be in a hundred years from now. The last one, 1917. That’s something, that’s a long time ago. And that was a horrible thing. Jim, go ahead."
2020-04-08,44:17,Jim Acosta,"Yeah, I want to get back to something you were saying yesterday about people going to Wisconsin and voting in the middle of this pandemic. Really putting their lives on the line. And you said, “Well, if they do that, vote by mail, perhaps we’ll have voter fraud in this country.” I just wanted to ask you if the voters in five states, Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Washington and Oregon, all vote by mail, can you or the White House staff or your campaigns provide any evidence to back up your claim, that mail-in voting is rife with fraud, like the example you gave of people working the rooms filling out false ballots?"
2020-04-08,44:52,Donald Trump,"Sure. Well, what happened-"
2020-04-08,44:52,Jim Acosta,"We’ve been talking about so far, since the beginning of this administration. Where’s the evidence?"
2020-04-08,44:58,Donald Trump,"I think there’s a lot of evidence, but we’ll provide you with some. Okay. And there’s evidence that’s being compiled just like it’s being compiled in the state of California, where they settled with judicial watch saying that a million people should not have been voting and you saw that. Did you? Wait, excuse me. Well, I’m just telling you. I’m telling you, in California, in the great state of California, they settled and we could have gone a lot further. Judicial watch settled where they agree that a million people should not have voted where they were 115 years old, and lots of things, and people were voting in that place."
2020-04-08,45:33,Donald Trump,"What I see in every one of those states that you mentioned, is a state that happens to be won by the Democrats. And if you have a position like me where it’s registered, you’re here, and we’re voting someplace where I’m not, I haven’t left the White House in I guess months other than to ask a ship to wave it goodbye to New York, which by the way is now being used for the purpose that we’re talking about, which a lot of people wanted. Wait a minute."
2020-04-08,46:04,Jim Acosta,Voting doesn’t work out well for the Republicans. So is your concern really just political?
2020-04-08,46:08,Donald Trump,"It certainly hasn’t. But if you’re a senior citizen and if you’re somebody that needs it, I’m all for it. But they have to be very careful. Because you know the things with bundling and all of the things that are happening with votes by mail where thousands of votes have gathered, and I’m not going to say which party does it, but thousands of votes have gathered, and they come in and they’re dumped in a location. And then all of a sudden you lose elections that you think you’re going to win. I won’t stand for it."
2020-04-08,46:38,Jim Acosta,Where’s the proof of that?
2020-04-08,46:38,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to find out about the proof because you’re going to see what’s going on. And I’m not going to stand for it. Our voting system, first of all, we should have voter ID. When you vote, you should have voter ID. And if you send something in, you should be sure as a state and as a country, you should be sure that that vote is meaningful, and it’s not just made fraudulently. Because there’s a lot of fraudulent voting going on in this country. This country should have voter ID. Okay, let’s do another one. Go, please."
2020-04-08,47:09,Unnamed,"Mr. President, surely the only way that we can track these millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine that are being distributed across the country is through the e-health data system. How systematically is your task force watching the system?"
2020-04-08,47:25,Donald Trump,"Well, I think it’s very systematic. Yeah. We’re distributing the hydroxy all through the country. It’s being distributed in large amounts. We have it coming in now. We were up to 29 million, doses then we went to, 30 million doses. But we have it coming in all throughout the country. And much of it’s being distributed. And in fact, it’ll start down what we have in our stockpile. And again, I hope it works. Again, I’m not a doctor as you possibly have found out. I’m not a doctor, but I’m a person with common sense. And we’ve had some very good results over the course, including a woman who just reported it two days ago. Yes."
2020-04-08,48:07,Unnamed,Through the e-health data system?
2020-04-08,48:09,Donald Trump,"No, we’re looking to provide it in many different ways. In many ways, where in certain instances, we’ve been asked, in the case of Michigan, we’ve been asked who the Governor of Michigan would like to, I think she’s become a big fan of it as a medication, as something that’s going to help with this horrible virus. And we’re delivering it to the governments of various states when they ask. So certain states are asking, certain governments are asking, and we’re delivering it directly to the government. Yeah, please."
2020-04-08,48:40,Unnamed,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. We know many people around the world are paying close attention to this conference, so on behalf of Foreign Media-"
2020-04-08,48:47,Donald Trump,Good. Where are you from? Where are you from?
2020-04-08,48:51,Unnamed,"I’m from Taiwan. On behalf of a Foreign Media Group, I would like to ask you two questions. First question is that the French President Macron called Iranian President Rouhani, and said that Euro has started to shift the medical goods to Iran. Would you consider-"
2020-04-08,49:11,Donald Trump,Medical goods?
2020-04-08,49:11,Unnamed,Yes.
2020-04-08,49:14,Donald Trump,That doesn’t bother me.
2020-04-08,49:16,Unnamed,Yeah. So would you think-
2020-04-08,49:17,Donald Trump,"If they’re sending medical goods to Iran, it doesn’t bother me. No."
2020-04-08,49:22,Unnamed,Okay. Yeah. So the other question is that the world also paying attention to the US election. So we are also note that the Bernie Sanders has drop out today.
2020-04-08,49:33,Donald Trump,"I did see that today. Well, he didn’t really drop out. What about his delegates? I mean, he said he’s going to keep his delegates and which is sort of interesting. He’s going to keep his delegates and he’d like to get more. Now, is he dropping out or not? That’s not dropping out. When you keep your delegates and then you want more delegates before you get to the convention, that’s a weird deal going on there. I don’t know what’s happening. And I don’t know why President Obama hasn’t supported Joe Biden a long time ago. There’s something he feels is wrong. Why isn’t… He’ll come out, I’m sure he’s going to come out at some point because he certainly doesn’t want to see me for four more years. We think a little bit differently. You know what? I’ll tell you it, it does amaze me that President Obama hasn’t supported sleepy Joe."
2020-04-08,50:21,Donald Trump,"It just hasn’t happened. When’s it going to happen? When is it going to happen? Why is it? He knows something that you don’t know, that I think I know, but you don’t know. So it’ll be interesting. But with Bernie, I saw his a standard fair today. I watched, and I hope that a lot of Bernie Sanders people, just like they did last time, we got a tremendous percentage of Bernie people. And I think they voted for me largely because of trade. Because Bernie and I agree on trade. We agree that the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country they do business with. The difference is, I’ve done a lot about it, and I’m doing more about it. And we’ve made incredible trade deals including USMCA, the deal with China. and then all of a sudden that gets disturbed by this virus situation. But China has to spend almost $250 billion on purchasing our products, $40 to $50 billion with our farmers, and the Bernie Sanders people are big believers on what I’m saying on trade."
2020-04-08,51:23,Donald Trump,"And I got a lot of them in the last election that surprised people, but it didn’t surprise me. Now, those are great people, they’re great people. But look, I’m looking at Bernie Sanders. I watched this morning. And I said, “What is that all about?” Like you said, the delegates, the delegates. He’s not giving up his delegates. He’s keeping them, and he said he wants to get more of them. And I think he’s doing it to negotiate, I assume, but I don’t know. That’s a hard thing to do. Yeah. Jeff, go ahead."
2020-04-08,51:51,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, OPEC is meeting with Russia tomorrow and some other countries to discuss oil prices. Oil prices are at $23 a barrel."
2020-04-08,52:01,Donald Trump,"Oh, that’s good. Finally, somebody knows something when they ask a question."
2020-04-08,52:05,Jeff (Reporter),What is your message to them ahead of their meeting tomorrow? Will the US consider a coordinated cut in production?
2020-04-08,52:13,Donald Trump,"I don’t think… Look, we already cut. We’re very market-oriented. If you look at Texas, and if you look at North Dakota, and if you look at some of our states that do this very well, they’ve already cut way back. They cut back automatically. But in the case of Russia, in the case of Saudi Arabia, they increased production at a time when you didn’t need it, and then they got hit by the virus, which knocked out 40% of the market. And now, they’re flooded with oil."
2020-04-08,52:38,Donald Trump,"Look, I just say this. You have two countries that are getting hurt very badly. Russia’s getting hurt. That’s their primary source, and Saudi Arabia that’s definitely their primary source. And it doesn’t make sense that they flooded the market. For whatever reason, they did that for themselves. It’s a argument that they had, and I think they’ll straighten it out. A lot of progress has been made over the last week, and it’ll be interesting to see what comes out of OPEC tomorrow. But OPEC, obviously… For many years, I used to think OPEC was very unfair."
2020-04-08,53:10,Donald Trump,"I hated OPEC. You want to know the truth? I hated it. Because it was a fix, but somewhere along the line, that broke down and it went the opposite way. And we have a tremendously powerful energy industry in this country now. Number one in the world, and I don’t want those jobs being lost."
2020-04-08,53:30,Jeff (Reporter),What would you do if they don’t end up cutting?
2020-04-08,53:31,Donald Trump,"We’ll see. I have a lot of options. Please. A lot of good options, Jeff. Beauties. I might like it even more. Now, you can go watch. Let’s see what happens. Hopefully they can make a deal. Let’s go."
2020-04-08,53:45,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Clearly Americans were getting very anxious to go back to work. There’s something optimistic, still very vague. Now that the IMHE model specifically has been adjusted down to 61,000, when are we going to open back up? Can you give us a better date? Is it going to be April 30th, May 1st?"
2020-04-08,54:03,Donald Trump,You…
2020-04-08,54:03,Unnamed,"Can you give us a better date? Is it going to be April 30th, May 1st?"
2020-04-08,54:03,Donald Trump,"You said adjusted back down 61,000, what was adjusted back?"
2020-04-08,54:07,Unnamed,"The IMH model. The one that originally predicted between 100,000 and 200,000."
2020-04-08,54:13,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s still a big number, right? 61, that’s a big number. Go ahead."
2020-04-08,54:19,Unnamed,But can you give us a more specific date? Will it be May 1st.
2020-04-08,54:24,Donald Trump,"I had a date and I thought it was a very aspirational date. It’s turning out to be very interesting because a lot of good things are happening by Easter, but I had a very aspirational date. I didn’t think we could make it. I didn’t say we would do it by Easter, but I said, “Well, wouldn’t that be great to shoot for Easter? That would be a great day. Beautiful day. Very important day to a lot of people like me and some of you in the room, maybe all of you in the room, frankly. But Easter is a very important day. So, aspirationally, I said, “Let’s see if we can do it at Easter,” but I said it would be very tough and I was criticized for that so I don’t like giving dates and that wasn’t a date. That was just an aspiration. That would have been incredible."
2020-04-08,55:08,Donald Trump,"But I don’t think we’re going to be very far behind and some of these models are looking like Easter is going to be a very important date anyway because of the curve. It’s hitting the top and it’s starting to come down and one person said Easter is looking like a good time. So, a good time for that, for heading down. So, we’ll see what happens. Look, there’s no reason to do that. We have a lot of good things happening. When I spoke to the governor of Louisiana today, he said, “Tony, they need far less beds than [inaudible 00:55:36].” I said, “Well, good because we’re building 1000 room additional. We built them 1000 beds and now we’re building another 1000. And I said, “Listen, is there a way that we don’t build, I don’t want to build them if they don’t need them.” In New York, the Javits isn’t too heavily used, it’s ready to go."
2020-04-08,55:52,Donald Trump,"2,900 beds, plus we now have the ship set for COVID, if they want to use it. And we’re using it for governor Murphy in New Jersey. So, we’ll see what happens but the numbers are coming way down. The ventilators, we’re all set. We have a lot to go if we want, but I’m not getting calls where they need ventilators anymore. So, we were right on those ventilators. I’d love to have additional ventilators for some of the countries that are our allies and our friends. And even if they’re not our allies and our friends, you’re saving human lives. But I’d love to see if we had some… We’re making a lot of ventilators right now. They take a while to make and they’re very expensive and they’re very complex to make, but I’d love to be able to help other countries once we’re taken care of."
2020-04-08,56:45,Donald Trump,"But I just sent 100 ventilators to Colorado and that was great. A senator there who’s a terrific Senator, Cory Gardner and he called me last night. He said, “Could you get 100 ventilators for Colorado?” And we just sent them out and there’ll be there very shortly. But it looks like we’re in great shape from the bed standpoint, it looks like we’re in great shape from the ventilator standpoint. And you just heard, I ordered 500 million masks, N95s and others and surgical, but we ordered 500 million masks, 300 and 200, and they’re going to be here very shortly. So, we’re really in great shape and we started off with an empty cupboard. So, I’m going to leave the vice president and his group to handle it and I will see you probably tomorrow. Okay. Thank you much."
2020-04-08,57:54,Mike Pence,"You all can come up if you want. That would be great. Well, good evening everyone and to our fellow Americans southwest, good afternoon. We find ourselves in the midst of a very tough week for Americans, in areas most impacted by the coronavirus. The New York City area, New Jersey, Louisiana, continue to focus resources and attention on those areas. And I know that the hearts and prayers of the American people are with all of those communities. But in the wake of more than 1.9 million tests, we see more than 400,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus and sadly, we’ve lost more than 14,000. We grieve but as the good book says, we do not grieve like those who have no hope. In this very special week, I know that the faith of millions of Americans is a comfort to them. The president and I spoke to more than 10,000 faith leaders and we were able to express to them our gratitude for the way that they’re strengthening the communities that they serve."
2020-04-08,59:13,Mike Pence,"But we also find hope in the numbers that Dr Birx will continue to reflect on today. For as Dr Fauci explained yesterday and in the days before, the losses as grievous as they are that we are seeing today are a reflection of people that contracted the coronavirus in many cases before strong mitigation steps were taken. Before the guidelines for America fully took hold. The cases, however, and the new cases and the hospitalizations are in fact a reflection of the results of what the American people are doing. And I want to echo the president’s and Dr. Birx’ statements today about the extraordinary work the American people are doing, because we continue to see great progress, low and steady numbers in the States of California and Washington and in the New York metropolitan area, New Jersey, New Orleans metro area, Detroit and Chicago and Boston. We continue to see evidence of stabilization that should be an encouragement to every American."
2020-04-08,01:00:36,Mike Pence,"An encouragement that we may be reaching the point where the impact of the coronavirus is beginning to level off, but it also should be an encouragement to every American to keep doing what we are all doing. Heed the guidance of your state and local authorities, and for every American, continue to put the White House coronavirus guidelines for America into effect. An area of particular concern we were briefed on this morning is the city of Philadelphia. I spoke today to governor Tom Wolf and as we begin to see early trend lines in Philadelphia, I assured him that we were going to continue to flow resources and support to that community. But our message to the people of the Philadelphia area is now more than ever, practice the social distancing so that Philadelphia, and to some extent even Pittsburgh, do not have to endure what other communities before them have had to endure."
2020-04-08,01:01:48,Mike Pence,"Also today, at the president’s direction, we hosted a conference call with every Republican member of the House of Representatives and every Democrat member of the House of Representatives. And we express our appreciation to speaker Nancy Pelosi and leader Kevin McCarthy for convening these forums. We brought together key members of our task force team. The Secretary of the Treasury discussed the progress that we’ve made on paycheck protection. He reported to members of Congress that so far we’re working with more than 3,600 lenders across the country and we’ve dispersed more than $98 billion in forgivable loans. Now, these are loans that if small businesses accept this money and use it to keep people on their payroll over the next two months, they’ll be completely forgiven. The Treasury tonight will be issuing a new FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions document, that will also make it clear that lenders may use their own closing documents for completing loan applications and information is available at treasury.gov and sba. gov as well."
2020-04-08,01:03:02,Mike Pence,"Dr Birx and Dr Fauci briefed the members of Congress today on the latest data. They’ll both reflect on that in a moment. We also had Admiral John [inaudible 01:03:11] talk about our control tower system and the extraordinary flow of supplies to critical areas across the country. We also briefed on the disbursement of resources to local hospitals of Seema Verma and gave them an update on what the secretary of state spoke about today. Remarkable to think, more than 50,000 Americans brought back home through nearly 500 flights and we thank the members of Congress who have worked with the state department to identify family members and groups that found themselves stranded overseas and we were grateful for that. In addition to our interaction with members of Congress today, we spoke with the president of the Henry Ford Hospital, Bob Riney. It is the Henry Ford Hospital that is conducting a clinical trial for hydrochloroquine."
2020-04-08,01:04:02,Mike Pence,"He expressed great enthusiasm for the work that they had done. They had a rather overwhelming response to the initial trial, which is beginning this week with 3000 people taking the hydrochloroquine or a placebo so they can match it. But what the president of the Henry Ford Hospital told me is they’d like to expand the test. I put him in touch with Steve Hahn and the FDA and we’ll be adding several more clinical trial paths to look at impacts on particular demographic groups, including seniors and minority populations, and more on that in just a moment. In the category of supplies and support, the president as of today has signed 52 major disaster declarations. Vermont was the latest approved and states have stood up some 27,000 national guard that are aiding in coronavirus response. On the critical subject of ventilators, we do have currently more than 8,000 ventilators in our strategic national stockpile and distributed more to the Navajo Nation out of Colorado today."
2020-04-08,01:05:15,Mike Pence,"But also today, we received the good news that the first delivery of newly manufactured ventilators from General Electric and Hamilton arrived at the strategic national stockpile and as the president said, we’ll be adding newly manufactured ventilators to our resources to be available as the coronavirus epidemic reaches critical communities around the country. On the subject of the Airbridge, four flights scheduled arrived today, primarily focused on gloves for our incredible healthcare workers. One flight alone had nearly 19 million gloves, another 8 million, another 15 million and the like. And the American people I think would be very proud to see this vast array of now well more than 50 flights that are bringing in supplies from all over the world, and again working through FEMA, we’re directing those resources with the guidance of our scientific experts to the communities most in need. As we announced yesterday, the White House coronavirus task force has requested that CDC and our team assemble data on the unique impact that we’re seeing reported on African Americans from the coronavirus."
2020-04-08,01:06:38,Mike Pence,"Dr Fauci spoke about it yesterday and we’ll reflect on his perspective on that as well. Tomorrow with the surgeon general and others on the White House team, we’ll be speaking with leaders in the African American community and as Dr Fauci will reflect, there have been historic challenges in the healthcare of the African African American communities. Particularly in our inner cities and now more than ever, I’ll just say from my heart to all of our African American family members now more than ever, practice the guidelines. Look after those most vulnerable people that have underlying serious health conditions. It’s more important than ever that we all put those principles into practice. Finally today, after we hear from Dr Fauci and Dr. Birx, I’m going to ask Dr Redfield to step up because today the CDC will be publishing new guidance on essential critical workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 but don’t have any symptoms. Don’t have a temperature and don’t have any reason to believe that they have the coronavirus."
2020-04-08,01:07:58,Mike Pence,"The present moment. The guidance is that if you have been in proximity to someone who did test positive for the coronavirus, that the guidance of CDC is that even with essential critical workers in industries from healthcare to food supply, that we ask people to stay home for 14 days. The new guidance tonight will hopefully make it clear that there would be an opportunity for those people playing such an incredible role in our nation’s response to be able to return to work and to do so safely. And finally, let me just say again how inspired we are with the response of the American people to the coronavirus epidemic. Each and every day, as we see the beginnings of encouraging news, the low and steady numbers in California and Washington State and now beginning to see numbers of hospitalizations are going down and new cases leveling and in some cases going down."
2020-04-08,01:09:02,Mike Pence,"We all hope it is the beginning of a trend, but we also hope it’s an encouragement to every American to keep doing what you’re doing. Not just for your own health and for the health of your loved ones, but because we want to make sure that all of us are doing our part to make sure that the fewest number of Americans possible are exposed to the coronavirus. Given the fact that this I remind you is three times more contagious than the flu. Each of us has a role to play in slowing the spread. That’s what the 30 days to slow the spread is all about. It’s about protecting your health. It’s about making sure that that our healthcare workers and our healthcare system is not overwhelmed by the coronavirus and ultimately it is about saving lives. We talk about the numbers and I’m going to ask Dr. Birx to come up and reflect on them, but I think all of us know this is one American at a time. It’s one heartbreak at a time and having lost loved ones in my life, just like everyone here and everyone looking on, we want to work every day to make that number of losses the lowest possible and it will take all of us to do it and to keep doing exactly what we’re doing through today. Dr. Birx."
2020-04-08,01:10:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr vice president. I just want to start where the vice president left off. I come out of the services, army, when we always talk about honoring the fallen and I think for every American, what we can do now to honor the fallen that have fallen and given that really their deaths to this horrible disease. To the healthcare workers that are the front lines trying to save every single one, to honor them and to honor our elders and the individuals that we know are at the greatest risk for bad outcomes. We all need to continue to do our work. Yes, the number of cases is stabilizing, but I do want to go through those numbers with you because we talk about these as micro epidemics in metro areas and in rural areas. So, in the New York metro area, which includes obviously Northern New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island, there is still 11,000 new cases per day and their positivity rate on their testing is still in the 40%+ range."
2020-04-08,01:11:37,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, there is still a significant amount of disease there and everyone needs to continue to follow the guidelines. New Orleans metro area, 800 new cases per day, but a zero positivity rate on their testing of 28%. Detroit Metro area, 1400 cases per day, 26% positivity. Chicago, 1200 cases per day and 18%. Boston, 18% positivity, 1100 cases per day. Denver has fallen to 180 cases per day, but still has 0% positivity in they’re testing. California and Washington have stayed stable at about Seattle, 350 cases per day. On the LA metro area, 800 cases per day, but their test positive rates are remaining in the 9% range. And so, this really gives us some idea of what it takes. They have been continuously mitigating. Imagine what we’re talking about, new York going from 40+ percent, zero positivity and 11,000 cases a day, down to the LA metro area of 800 cases per day and 9%. So, this is what when the president talks about reaching the top and coming down, those are the kinds of things we need to see and the only way we will see them is if every American continues to follow the guidance."
2020-04-08,01:13:02,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Now, in the Philadelphia metro area where I come from, it’s 1400 cases per day. This of course includes Camden, the counties around, the Philadelphia Metro and Wilmington. And in the Baltimore and the Washington DC area, 15% zero positivity and 500 cases per day and 200 cases per day in Baltimore. This is how we’re looking at it, County by County, metro by Metro, rural region by rural region to make sure we don’t miss anything. And we’re triangulating testing data with the attack rates, with the hospitalization, with the number of cases, and really creating a mosaic of who needs what when to ensure that every American is served well. I had a great call today with a group of pediatricians, the head of the American Academy of Pediatrics and with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Behind the scenes and working every day are the pediatricians fielding those phone calls from every concerned mother and of course grandmothers like myself, and protecting our children every day to ensure that they have access to the medical care that they need while this is happening."
2020-04-08,01:14:15,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And to every pregnant woman out there, I was very reassured hearing from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. They have put amazing things in place to protect every pregnant woman. They have been social distancing in their offices. They have increased all of the disinfecting. They have lengthened the time between clients. To every pregnant woman, don’t miss your appointments. If your OB thinks you need to be there, you should go and please know that on the labor and delivery wards, they are doing everything to protect you and their babies. They are committed to you. They are absolutely committed to you having a good experience. Make sure if your physician believes you should be in the hospital for your delivery, make sure you’re following their guidance. We don’t want any pregnant women to suffer a bad outcome during this time. So again, I just want to conclude by thanking the American people and recognizing the number of people we’re losing per day is serious to all of us and it could be so much worse, but our frontline healthcare providers and the way they’re talking to each other about how to improve care for every individual that they serve."
2020-04-08,01:15:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You see them on the TV, you see them in the emergency room, you see what they’re up against. This is how we can honor them is to make sure we continue to, as Dr Fauci always says, put your foot on the gas and make sure that we continue to strongly mitigate and really protect those with preexisting conditions. And finally, those preexisting conditions we know now include asthma. So, asthma, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes. On any of these conditions, renal disease. No matter what age, please make sure you’re following the guidelines to protect those individuals in your household. We know they’re more susceptible to a worse outcome. We don’t think that anyone’s more susceptible to getting infected. I want to make sure that everyone understands, everybody is susceptible to getting infected. This virus is very transmittable as we well know, but we need to protect those that need our protection the most. So, thank you all for what you’re doing to get the message out, to ensure that we continue to protect each other in this very difficult time."
2020-04-08,01:16:38,Mike Pence,"Great. Dr Fauci, please."
2020-04-08,01:16:41,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you Mr vice president. Just to follow up and underscore what Dr Birx had said. As I’ve said many times from this podium, the spectrum of going from infection to getting ill to requiring hospitalization to intensive care to death, and what is the most striking thing that obviously is so sobering to us is when we see the number of deaths. We know now for sure that the mitigation that we have been doing is having a positive effect but you don’t see it until weeks later. Remember, this past weekend when we all of us got up in front of this podium and mentioned that this was going to be a really bad week. At the same time, we were saying that we would hope we would start to see a little bit of a change in the daily hospitalizations, intensive care and intubations and New York is starting to see that. So, I say that but I draw back a bit. Don’t get complacent about that because what’s going to happen two and a half weeks from now is really what’s going to happen with regard to the people who are getting new infection."
2020-04-08,01:17:45,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"As Dr. Birx said, everybody is almost certainly as susceptible as anybody else to getting infected. It’s what happens to you after you get infected and again, to just keep emphasizing, we need to keep mitigating. We know that this is something that is a strain on the American public, but it’s just something that we have not only the only tool, it’s the best tool. And to just shift a bit to what we said yesterday regarding the African American community, it is very painful to see, and I’ve seen it throughout my entire medical career, that the health disparities in the minority community, but particularly the African American community, puts them at risk apart from coronavirus issues. Puts them at risk for diseases much more so than the general population."
2020-04-08,01:18:38,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The double whammy that you suffer now is when you have this terrible virus which essentially prays in its ultimate deleterious effects on people with those underlying conditions. And since that is more predominant in the African American population, we want to double down and say to the young people, to the elderly people in that community to please try as best as you can to protect yourself, if you’re a younger person, and to please protect the people who are susceptible. Your grandmother, your grandfather, your elder uncle, the people who have these underlying conditions, because we are not going to solve the issues of health disparities this month or next month. This is something we should commit ourselves for years to do. But what we can do now today is to prevent people who are put at higher risk, because of the demographic group, from getting into a situation which is much more deleterious than the general population."
2020-04-08,01:19:43,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So, I plead with all of us in the population, but particularly for those of us, our brothers and sisters in the African American community, because we know that mitigation does work. The reason we know it works is the question that was asked about the numbers, that why they came down with the projections, because remember what you do with data will always outstrip a model. You redo your models depending upon your data, and our data is telling us that mitigation is working. So again, as Dr. Birx said, keep your foot on the accelerator because that’s what’s going to get us through this."
2020-04-08,01:20:21,Mike Pence,That’s great. Dr Redfield.
2020-04-08,01:20:27,Dr Redfield,"Thank you, Mr. vice president. I just wanted to follow up. One of the most important things we can do is keep our critical workforce working, and I think you heard it said that we have many different critical workforce industries in this country. Obviously, first responders, healthcare workers, but as you heard, it’s also individuals who help maintain our food supply, et cetera. And so, what CDC has done is that we’ve really looked at the essential workforce and how to maintain that workforce, particularly at this time as we begin to-"
2020-04-08,01:21:03,Dr Redfield,"Workforce particularly at this time as we begin to get ready to reopen and have confidence in bringing our workforces back to work and so we’ve put out a new guidance for essential healthcare workers who’ve been exposed to the coronavirus. These are individuals that have been within six feet of a confirmed case or suspected a case and so that they can, under certain circumstances, they can go back to work. If they’re asymptomatic as the vice president said, they could go back to work if they do several things as we say here, take their temperature before they go to work, where a face mask at all times and practice social distancing when they’re at work."
2020-04-08,01:21:46,Dr Redfield,"What we’d ask them not to do when they’re at work is we want them to stay at home if they’re sick, we want them not to share objects that would be touching their face and we would like them not to congregate in break rooms, lunch rooms and crowded places and then the second slide, if we’re talking to the employers of these critical industries, we would ask those employers to take the employees temperature and assess their symptoms before starting them back to work. If the employee does become sick, we want them to be sent home immediately. We’d like them to increase air exchange in the buildings and increase the frequency of how they clean common surfaces and really began to get these workers back into the critical workforce so that we won’t have a worker shortage in these critical industries. So that’s the new guidelines the CDC will be posting today."
2020-04-08,01:22:46,Mike Pence,Those will be available at cdc.gov and thank you Dr. Redfield and questions for anyone on the panel. Please.
2020-04-08,01:22:54,Unnamed,"Just a couple of things to clarify. The 500 million masks the president mentioned that are being developed, are those for healthcare workers or are you planning to actually hand out masks to the American public?"
2020-04-08,01:23:07,Mike Pence,"I think the focus has been to make sure that our healthcare workers in our healthcare system has the supply and with regard to what we’re gathering from literally around the world and for manufacturers in the United States is first being deployed to states and to hospital systems, but I must tell you that whether it be the Hanes company or other companies, we’re seeing manufacturers in America that are recognizing the growing demand for masks by the American people and are spinning out production literally by the hour, but our focus, our continuing focus is on making sure that healthcare workers have the personal protective equipment to do their job safely and provide the level of care every one of us would want."
2020-04-08,01:24:00,Unnamed,Thank you. Mr. Vice President. Kansas governor Laura Kelly says that she has put in seven requests to FEMA for supplies from the stockpile and those have not been fulfilled. So will Kansas be getting any of the ventilators because the request included ventilators and does she need to be calling the White House instead? Have you spoken with her directly?
2020-04-08,01:24:20,Mike Pence,"I’ve not spoken to the governor directly, but I’ll reach out this evening certainly. In our conference call with governors this week, we spoke to them about the approach that we are taking. Traditionally governors are accustomed to when a hurricane strikes the Gulf Coast, when wildfires strike out west, when flooding or tornadoes hit in places like Indiana, you’re accustomed to have a declaration of emergency approved and then resources flow from FEMA. In this situation as we deal with a nationwide declaration and an epidemic, what we’ve explained to governors is that what President Trump has directed is that we leave no stone unturned to find resources around the country and around the world including ventilators and we make sure as the coronavirus epidemic impacts individual areas, that the healthcare workers and the families and the patients impacted have what they need when they need it."
2020-04-08,01:25:34,Mike Pence,"What I would say to the people of Kansas is that we’re looking at their numbers every day, just as in the case of every state in the country and we’re going to work our hearts out to make sure that as the coronavirus cases emerge, and we hope that through the great work that Kansas has done on social distancing and mitigation, the people of Kansas have done a remarkable job, that we may well be to a place where their existing resources and capacities are present, but we want people to know that taking the counsel of Dr. Birx and our entire healthcare team, we’re focusing just as we did first in Seattle, California, and now in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana, the Detroit area, the Chicago area, we’re going to make sure that those resources go in that order."
2020-04-08,01:26:28,Unnamed,You brought up social distancing and the work that Kansas has done. there’s actually a controversy right now over her order to limit the number of people in religious gatherings to 10 people. Should states be telling religious institutions how many people can gather if it’s to stop the spread of the coronavirus?
2020-04-08,01:26:45,Mike Pence,"Well, the president’s coronavirus guidelines for America ask every American to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people and that’s on the advice of all of best scientific experts as a way that we can slow the spread, but as we’ve made clear to every governor, we defer to our governors and what they believe is the best and appropriate practice in their states and we’ll support those local decisions."
2020-04-08,01:27:13,Unnamed,"Thank you. In his opening statement, the president said there were 10 drugs that are now in clinical trials would hydroxychloroquine be one of those."
2020-04-08,01:27:22,Mike Pence,"Well, I can speak to that just… Then I’ll invite Dr. Birx, Dr Fauci to come forward. We do have… I believe we will have roughly four separate clinical trials underway studying hydroxychloroquine, but it’s important to remember that, as the president’s made the point many times, the FDA has approved what’s called off label use and so in consulting with your physician, if your physician determines it’s appropriate to write a prescription for hydroxychloroquine, we’re working today to make that available across the country. It’s broadly available today as an anti malaria medication, but we’re working around the country and internationally to increase that supply, but we are studying it in at least four different clinical trials and Dr. Fauci can speak to that."
2020-04-08,01:28:17,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The easiest… Thank you for that question. The easiest way to find out is to just go clinicaltrials.gov and it will tell you everything that’s there. There are a number of different clinical trials, some of which are randomized controlled trials, which as I’ve said many times from this podium, to me is the optimal way to determine ultimately if something is safe and effective and works, but there are a lot of different ways that it’s being looked at. It’s being looked at against the placebo. It’s being part of a multi arm trial comparing it with others. There’s a trial that was recently started actually in prophylaxis among healthcare workers, so there are several of these."
2020-04-08,01:28:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"In addition to that, there’s what was just mentioned now that any physician in consultation with their patient and back and forth can make the decision to use the drug on an off label. So we have two things that are simultaneously going on. We’re having actual formal clinical trials and the off label use."
2020-04-08,01:29:16,Mike Pence,"Next, please."
2020-04-08,01:29:17,Unnamed,"I want to turn back to the disproportionate rates of black desks when it comes to the coronavirus. Dr. Fauci, You have been talking about this for weeks if there were underlying health issues… People with underlying health issues are most at risk, but if we knew that blacks disproportionately have fallen into that category, why wasn’t the CDC prepared to gather this data in real time to work to fight this?"
2020-04-08,01:29:39,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, I’m not sure, but we have the director of the CDC here that could answer that question, but let me try to just take it from a different perspective. The health disparities that exist are not anything that started with coronavirus. They were there, so there isn’t much you can do about the disparity. The thing you can do is to make an extra special effort to protect people who have the underlying conditions. So it’s the same way as we say, well the elderly and those with underlying condition. Unfortunately, the African American community has a much greater proportion population for population of these underlying conditions. The best weapon we have right now is what I said in my opening remarks is to do whatever we can to get them to realize that what we need to do is to protect them from getting infected and to also protect them from inadvertently and innocently bringing the infection to people who have these underlying conditions."
2020-04-08,01:30:48,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. Can you explain the thinking behind these 100 ventilators that were given to Colorado when other states like Kansas have had trouble getting ventilators and can you say whether a personal relationship with president is helping states like Colorado get these ventilators? I mean there are 15 States that have more cases than Colorado."
2020-04-08,01:31:08,Mike Pence,"What I can say is that we’ve been watching Denver very closely and like many of the other key areas that I touched on, we’re beginning to see some encouraging news, but in our interactions with the governor and with local officials and with the senator, we’ve made an effort not only in Colorado but around the country to be particularly responsive to states where we’ve seen a growth in cases, but I’m going to let Dr. Burk speak to that as well. There’s a literally beginning with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana, the Detroit area in Michigan, Chicago area. There’s a series of other cities including Denver that we’ve been watching very carefully and while we’re beginning to see some encouraging news, we want healthcare workers in those communities to know for certain that we’re going to move resources into those areas where we see significant outbreak."
2020-04-08,01:32:15,Unnamed,Can you address whether individual governors’ with relationships with the president are getting preferential treatment.
2020-04-08,01:32:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I can tell you within that decision complex is not just the absolute number of cases, it’s the hospital capacity and what each of those hospitals have. So remember I think a couple of days ago we talked about how the states are sending the information about ICU beds, hospital beds, ventilator needs. So different States have different… Which I don’t think any of us probably knew before this, but there are some states that have lots of ventilators and there’s other states that proportion to their population, or by their cases of COVID, have less. I’m sure Denver and Colorado fit into that model where there were hospitals that had less than ventilators proportionally and were needed for the cases that were seeing. That’s the kind of analysis so every state that a few cases more than Colorado have all received ventilators except for I think Texas and that’s just because they are just starting."
2020-04-08,01:33:21,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Remember we started… Colorado was one early on the curve, so they have many more people have moved through that progress and are in need of ventilators. Texas is very early in their curve in both Dallas and Houston so that’s what I was talking about. Each of these are a micro curve that we have to follow independently or we would may be making general decisions rather than specific decisions by geography."
2020-04-08,01:33:46,Unnamed,Vice President followup on the churches question. You’re obviously very religious man. Will you be going to church on Sunday?
2020-04-08,01:33:55,Mike Pence,We’ll be attending church right in the living room at the Vice President’s residence where we’ve been attending for the last several weeks. The advantage is we get to go to our home church in Indiana.
2020-04-08,01:34:06,Unnamed,Is that the same example you’d like to see churches around the country regardless of what governors are saying do as well?
2020-04-08,01:34:14,Mike Pence,"I think the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America are very clear that during this 30 days, we are calling on every American in every state first to listen to your state and local authorities, but right after that, to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, avoid unnecessary travel, use drive through at restaurant instead of going into the restaurant, we are as these health experts have told you, seeing real evidence that we’re slowing the spread, that these mitigation efforts are having a strong impact and tonight as many people even at this hour on the east coast are beginning to sit down to a Seder dinner. It’s the beginning of Passover and with Easter celebrations this Sunday, we just want to encourage every American to heed the counsel of the guidelines, put those into effect and know that in so doing will hasten the day, will hasten the day that we put the coronavirus in the past and we reopened our country."
2020-04-08,01:35:20,Unnamed,"Mr. Vice President, last question about Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci. As you are both probably aware, there’s a lot of misinformation conspiracy theories out there about the coronavirus. There are some commentators who are suggesting that the number of dead are being inflated because they’re saying that people who are dying with other issues are being listed as COVID-19 deaths. Perhaps you’ve seen some of this commentary. You may be too busy to see it, but it is out there. What do you say to those folks who are making the claim without really any evidence that these deaths are being padded, that the number of COVID-19 deaths are being padded. For example, somebody might die from a number of factors, but had coronavirus are being listed as coronavirus deaths and because of that, the number is being inflated."
2020-04-08,01:36:13,Mike Pence,That’s fair question. You might also speak about the converse.
2020-04-08,01:36:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, we’ve been hearing the converse to that. We’ve been hearing both sides of that. I think we’ve made it very clear, I think every time I’ve been up here about the comorbidities and so most of the people… We talked about the Italy data. The majority of the Italians who succumbed to this had three or more comorbidities. This has been known from the beginning so those individuals will have an underlying condition, but that underlying condition did not because their acute death when it’s related to a COVID infection. In fact, it’s the opposite. Having an underlying condition and getting this virus we know is particularly damaging to those individuals. We don’t know all the pathophysiology. I wish we did right now. We see a lot of vasculitis where Tony and I came from. Tony, actually… Dr Fauci started in the vasculitis in Wagner’s."
2020-04-08,01:37:21,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I mean these are things we have studied for a long time. We are trying to understand the pathophysiology, but what we can tell you at this moment, if you have asthma, if you have renal disease, if you have diabetes, if you have hypertension, these are preexisting conditions that puts you at a greater risk to having a worse outcome."
2020-04-08,01:37:41,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Just add a comment to that because having been through other serious issues, particularly the very painful early years of HIV AIDS, when people talk about conspiracy theories. You will always have conspiracy theories when you have a very challenging public health crises. They are nothing but distractions. I can assure you, we have so much to do to protect the health and the welfare of the American people that I would just hope we just put those conspiracy stuff and let somebody write a book about it later on, but not now."
2020-04-08,01:38:20,Unnamed,"Dr. Birx, you said something about not enough tests being performed because some of the labs, the machines aren’t running. Did you want to clarify that? What did you mean by 80% weren’t running?"
2020-04-08,01:38:34,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I have a call with them at 8:00 PM tonight, every single one of those 120 laboratories, I think 87 of the laboratory directors have confirmed that call. It has to do with a machine called an Abbott M2000. It’s a very high [inaudible 01:38:49] machine. We have a million tests out there. I made a big push and Abbott was extraordinary about getting those out to the labs. I mean, this is not sitting in a warehouse. These are physically in these laboratories sitting there right now."
2020-04-08,01:39:03,Unnamed,The machines aren’t running.
2020-04-08,01:39:04,Dr. Deborah Birx,"They’re not running. So we’ve only run 88,000 tests in three weeks off of those machines with a million test kits. So as someone who has worked in a lot of laboratories, to have a machine that is needed because we could have screened every healthcare worker, these machines are every place in the country, so they could have screened in these last three weeks, 100% of the healthcare workers across the country that needed these tests to be done, and they’re of high throughput. So I have a call with them at 8:00 to really talk about-"
2020-04-08,01:39:40,Unnamed,Can an order be given?
2020-04-08,01:39:42,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I asked the Vice President to give me a chance to talk to my colleagues first, but we have a call with the CEOs of those hospitals tomorrow."
2020-04-08,01:39:54,Mike Pence,"Thank you. That’s a really important question and it underscores the fact the Dr. Birx pointed out, that with this new tests, Abbott Laboratories, FEMA’s been busy distributing to states around the country. We purchased 1200 of these machines to be able to do these tests, but there’s 18,000 all across America. Let me just renew our call to all the hospital administrators and lab operators around America to go and identify those Abbott Laboratories machines and know that that’s… While we’ve already tested more than 1.9 million Americans, our short term objective is to test as many Americans as possible as we see the coronavirus epidemic emerge in areas around the country. We want to surge those resources. We want states that haven’t seen a significant outbreak to have access to that 15 minute test and ultimately as we go forward, once we…"
2020-04-08,01:41:03,Mike Pence,"I think president Trump said today, nobody wants to open the country up more than him and I can attest to that, but we’re going to open it up when we can do so responsibly, putting the health of America first and to reopen America and to stay open America. We’re working around the clock to continually expand the kind of testing that will allow us to do what these experts call surveillance so that in every state in the country, once we put this chapter of coronavirus behind us, we hope and trust sooner rather than later, that when next fall comes that we will have a vast array so that CDC can do what it so well and that is when a particular disease emerges, CDC surges personnel, does contact tracing, isolates that individual. So we’re just really calling on all of our partners in the laboratories and in hospitals around the country to identify those Abbott Laboratory machines and help us continue to scale up and expand testing."
2020-04-08,01:42:11,Mike Pence,"Every American, let me again just say thank you. Thank you for what you’re doing. We are in the midst of a week of heartache and I want to assure every American who has suffered loss, that we’re with you. We’re praying for you and your families and we’ll continue to work our hearts out to make sure these incredible healthcare workers who are inspiring every single one of us all across the country every day, have the resources and the support and the equipment to do their job safely, to provide the level of care that any American family would want for their loved one, and to be able to go home safely to their families. The key to all of that, the key for the next 22 days is 30 days to slow the spread and I just encourage every American, if you haven’t done so recently, go to coronavirus.gov, print off your own copy, pick up the phone and call a friend and just tell them that you heard from the experts, you heard from the president and our team that we’re beginning to see glimmers of hope."
2020-04-08,01:43:25,Mike Pence,"Extraordinary progress in California, in Washington as a tribute to the people of those states and the leadership of those states, but the beginning of stabilization and perhaps even leveling in New York and New Jersey and Louisiana and Detroit is a testament to the people of those communities, to the leadership of those states, but understand that every one of us has a role to play to protect the most vulnerable among us and to save lives by putting the guidelines into practice, just like you’ve been doing every day since they were first announced. So thank you all and we’ll see you tomorrow."
2020-04-09,00:13,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much everybody. I’d like to begin by saying that we just completed a meeting with the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of Transportation, Elaine Chao on proposals regarding the airlines and the airline business, and we’re working very closely with a lot of different people. We’ll be probably putting out a proposal and giving them some of the details, some of the very powerful details over the weekend."
2020-04-09,00:50,Donald Trump,"It’s moving along quickly. The airline business has been hit very hard as everybody knows, and we are going to be in a position to do a lot to help them so that they keep their employees and they save their businesses, and that’ll be taking place I think you can say over the weekend. We may even have discussions with some of the airlines or all of the airlines over the weekend. And I think it’s going to be a very acceptable package. It’s a very big package and a very acceptable package. It’ll be good for our country, good for the airlines, good for a lot of people."
2020-04-09,01:26,Donald Trump,"Likewise, I just spoke with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin and the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, and we had a big talk as to oil production and OPEC and making it so that our industry does well and the oil industry does better than it’s doing right now. The numbers are so low that there’ll be layoffs all over the world. There’ll be certainly layoffs in this country. We don’t want that to happen. We built a great, great energy business in the United States, so we have tens of thousands of jobs. We had a very good talk. We’ll see what happens. But as you know OPEC met today and I would say they’re getting close to a deal. We’ll soon find out. So that was a conversation we just had."
2020-04-09,02:17,Donald Trump,"So we had a busy hour and a half. And let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to the American people. Millions of Americans are making profound and difficult sacrifices in their own lives because they know it will save the lives of countless others. And that’s exactly what it’s doing. You see what’s happening and where we are, where we stand. And hopefully we’re going to be opening up. We can call it opening very, very, very, very soon I hope. Together our people are writing one of the most noble chapters in the proud history of our nation. Americans are also encouraged to learn that Boris Johnson Prime Minister has been moved of intensive care. That’s a tremendous statement and we continue to pray for him and his fast recovery. That’s a very, very positive development."
2020-04-09,03:09,Donald Trump,"As the New York metropolitan area continues its battle against the outbreak, the full power of the federal government is there to support them. As you know the Javits Center has now been fully converted into a 3,000 bed hospital, one of the largest anywhere in the country, and by the incredible professionals, I have to say the Corps of Engineers, what they can do is just incredible. They’ve done a fantastic job and they’re building nationwide 21 temporary hospitals and care facilities, adding 17,000 hospital beds and they did that all within a very short period of time. It’s incredible what they’ve done. Army Corps of Engineers. And FEMA has been fantastic."
2020-04-09,03:52,Donald Trump,"Our sweeping airlift operation to keep doctors and nurses supplied with protective equipment. Project Airbridge continues to expand with more than 24 flights already completed and 49 additional flights now scheduled in the near future. So that’s been very successful, and that gear and those outfits are being handed out as they arrive. They’re going directly to point."
2020-04-09,04:16,Donald Trump,"The American medical system continues to perform beyond our highest expectations, reminding us that the United States is blessed with the most advanced healthcare and the most skilled healthcare workers anywhere in the planet. Other countries are looking to what we’re doing and our testing operation has now become far and away the most sophisticated and the best anywhere. And we want to thank all of the heroes on the front lines as they fight to save American lives. We’re at the top of the Hill, pretty sure we’re at the top of the hill and now we’re going downward. In some cases we’ve already started that process."
2020-04-09,04:54,Donald Trump,"Earlier today, I spoke with hundreds of mental health leaders and advocates from around the country to discuss the vital work and the vital work they’re doing. We had the top doctors in the country, some international doctors, mental health, big factor, not only as the virus inflicted immense physical suffering on many people, but also mental and emotional suffering as well. Even though we’re staying physically apart, no American is alone and we’re all in this together, but the mental health doctors and experts, a very great call. It was a very interesting call. They’re working very hard."
2020-04-09,05:33,Donald Trump,"We’re also seeing encouraging signs in our race to develop breakthrough treatments and therapies. Pfizer revealed today that it has found a promising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating and it hopes to begin testing in clinical trials very soon. It’s going to be very, very soon. They have great feelings for this particular therapy and they think that a lot of good things are happening. Through the FDA’s coronavirus treatment acceleration program 19 therapies and treatments are now being tested and 26 more in the active planning or clinical trials. So we have 19 therapies being tested currently and 26 more are in the active planning for clinical trials. That’s a big statement. That’s a lot."
2020-04-09,06:28,Donald Trump,"Trials for Gilead’s anti-viral drug remdesivir continue and the company has also expanded emergency used for new patients. Getting good early results, by the way. The companies that manufacture hydroxychloroquine are massively ramping up production. As you know many people are recommending strongly Z-Pak be added. The Z-Pak and also zinc."
2020-04-09,06:58,Donald Trump,"And the federal government continues to build our stockpiles and distribute millions of doses for doctors to use as they see fit. And I’m pleased to inform you we’re just having… A lot of good things are happening, but we’ll have to see how that all works out. But we’ve purchased and we have stockpiled millions and millions of doses and we’re distributing it some states who want it very badly. Michigan, we just sent a lot to Michigan and other areas."
2020-04-09,07:28,Donald Trump,"I’m reporting today that we passed a 2 million tests completed in the United States, first time, most anywhere in the country. It’s a milestone for our country. It’s a milestone anywhere. Nobody’s done anywhere close. Our tests are highly sophisticated and highly accurate. At the same time, we’re making important progress on the economic front of this war. In a few moments, Secretary of labor, Eugene Scalia will explain new steps that were taken to ensure American workers swiftly receive unemployment and paid leave benefits and that employers protect the health and safety of all workers, including essential workers on the job. Working very, very closely with workers and with employers."
2020-04-09,08:11,Donald Trump,"To provide further economic relief the Federal Reserve announced this morning that it’ll provide up to $2.3 trillion in support to businesses, states and local government. $600 billion in loans will be available for mid-size businesses with up to 10,000 employees and $500 billion will be available for states, counties with over 2 million residents in cities with a population of over 1 million."
2020-04-09,08:40,Donald Trump,"My administration’s also working with Congress to replenish the very successful, incredibly successful the way it’s going, paycheck protection program, which is allowing hundreds of thousands of small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll, meaning it’ll keep those businesses open. We need both Democrats and Republicans to come together to get this legislation completed, and it looks like it’s on its way, but we need both. And it should be for people that are working, for the workers, and if you look and you see we have a lot of people that are affected by that and it’s a very positive development. So we have to get a bipartisan approval of that and hopefully that’ll happen."
2020-04-09,09:26,Donald Trump,"Today the Department of education is also announcing the availability of more than $6 billion in emergency grant funding to assist college students impacted by the cancellation of classes and the suspension of housing. A lot of people had a lot of things suspended, housing is one of them. Previously we waived student loan payments for six months, so student loan payments have been waived for six months and we’ll discuss it after that, it may go further."
2020-04-09,09:57,Donald Trump,"Although this medical war has separated our citizens for a period of time, it’s also united our entire nation, I think I can say like almost never before. Americans are moving forward with common purpose and shared resolve, determined to vanquish the virus and lift our nation to even greater heights. We are supremely confident in the magnificent future that awaits the American people. And with that, before I invite our vice president, our great vice-president and Gene Scalia to speak, we’ll take a few questions and then I’m going back into negotiations on oil and on airlines. Yeah, please."
2020-04-09,10:37,Unnamed,Can you tell us a little bit more about your conversation With President Putin and the king.
2020-04-09,10:41,Donald Trump,Had a very good conversation.
2020-04-09,10:43,Unnamed,Did you organize that call and do they understand the problems they’re causing with the oil output situation?
2020-04-09,10:50,Donald Trump,"There’s so much production nobody even knows what to do with it. That’s how it’s working. And Saudi Arabia and as you know Russia, it’s well known that we’re producing a lot and they were perhaps fighting with each other over the production and the amount of oil being produced. And frankly there’s not enough room to even store it. Our storage is now full, going to be very soon. Our strategic national storage is, I said this is a great time to fill it up, load it up with oil that frankly is at pricing that nobody’s ever seen before. I don’t think we’ve seen this probably since the 1950s. That was with big dollars."
2020-04-09,11:31,Donald Trump,"So we’ll see what happens. The conversation was very good. They’re getting close to a deal. That’s OPEC and many other countries outside of OPEC. And we’ll see what happens. [crosstalk 00:11:42] No, I think they were getting along very well. We had a very good call. I think it was a very good call. We’re going to see what happens, but it was a very good goal. They’ll probably announce something either today or tomorrow. One way or other. Could be good, could be not so good, but I think one way or the other. Go ahead, Jim."
2020-04-09,11:58,Jim (Reporter),"Mr. President, how could the administration discuss the possibility of reopening the country when the administration does not have an adequate nationwide testing system for this virus? Don’t you need a nationwide testing system for the virus before you reopen [crosstalk 00:00:12:12]."
2020-04-09,12:12,Donald Trump,"No, we have a great testing system. We have the best, right now the best testing system in the world. But there are certain sections in the country that are in phenomenal shape already. Other sections are coming online, other sections are going down. And we in addition to that are giving out millions of tests and every day we’re doing it exponentially. We’re picking up and what we’ll be doing in the very near future is going to certain areas of our country and do massive testing. It’s not necessary, but it would be a good thing to have."
2020-04-09,12:46,Jim (Reporter),"Don’t you need, though Mr. President, to make sure people are safe going back to work? You don’t want to send people back to the workplace."
2020-04-09,12:51,Donald Trump,"We want to have it and we’re going to see if we have it. Do you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes. We’re talking about 325 million people and that’s not going to happen as you can imagine, and it would never happen with anyone else either. Other countries do it, but they do it in a limited form. We’ll probably be the leader of the pack. Please."
2020-04-09,13:11,Unnamed,"Mr. President, what do you say to the 16 million Americans, more than 16 million Americans who have lost their jobs in the last three weeks and fear that the economy won’t just bounce back like you said?"
2020-04-09,13:22,Donald Trump,"Well, I think the economy is going to do very well. Now that’s just my feeling. It’s a strong feeling. I’ve had good, proper feelings about a lot of things over the years and I think we’re going to do well. We’re doing very… Looks like we’re at the lower end of the curb in terms of death, which is a terrible word, a terrible dark word that we’ve experienced like nobody’s ever seen before in this country. We have numbers that are terrible. But when you look at the lower prediction levels of a 100,000 to 120,000 to 220,000, or if we did nothing up to 2.2 million people, we’re looking at a much lower level than the level of, I hope, than the level of 100,000. So we’re going to see."
2020-04-09,14:11,Donald Trump,"We’re going to have to, you can never do anything about the people that lost their loved ones and lost their friends. The great friendships. And I’m not sure a lot of people will ever be the same, but I think our country from an economic standpoint will end up being stronger than ever. We have tremendous stimulus. We have tremendous stimulus plans. We have things in the works that are going to really, I think, fire the country."
2020-04-09,14:36,Donald Trump,"I think that what’s going to happen is we’re going to have a big bounce rather than a small bounce. But we will be back and I think honestly, I think our country’s going to be back from an economic standpoint, again, you can never replace the people that were lost and to their families, certainly you can never do a thing like that. But we will have succeeded in many ways. Hopefully keeping the number way below our minimum numbers and also from an economic standpoint. We met with the mental health people today and that takes a… This is taken a tremendous toll mentally on a lot of people. I think we’re going to open up strong. I think we’re going to open up very successfully and I’d like to say even more successfully than before. Please."
2020-04-09,15:23,Unnamed,"Thank you. Mr. President oil was trading today at about $23 a barrel in New York. What would you want to see the price? Do you want it at $30, $40, $50 a barrel?"
2020-04-09,15:32,Donald Trump,"Well, I want to see it where there’s a certain market, but I don’t want to see it where people have no idea. We’ll be opening up areas for storage of oil, massive areas for storage of oil because oil today is not selling and what happened is the virus knocked out 40% of the market. You know that. You know the number. 40%. Now there was a lot of oil, but it was very controllable. All of a sudden they lost 40%. you look at the roads, you look at the car, you look at what’s going on. There’s nobody driving. There’s no reason for it right now. That’ll start coming back."
2020-04-09,16:10,Donald Trump,"But we are storing millions of barrels of oil that nobody thought would even be possible. Frankly, ships turned out to be a good business for some people because they’re filling up tankers, sending them out to sea and not saying where to go. They’re just sitting out there loaded up with oil. So we want to save our energy. In this country, we want to make sure that our energy companies, businesses, and employees, workers remain strong. So that’s how I’m involved. And I think that’s going to happen."
2020-04-09,16:41,Donald Trump,"So right now, if you look, you’re probably talking $23-$25. If they announce a deal, we can get it up. We need a minimum number so the companies don’t go out of business. So they’re not going to lay off all of these energy workers who are important to our country. And we’re now energy independent. We could do something where we only used our oil, but I think the longterm benefit is to be able to-"
2020-04-09,17:03,Donald Trump,"… But I think the longterm benefit is to be able to just go with the market and it’s going to work out. It’s all going to work out. If you looked at three weeks ago, as you know, because we talked about three weeks ago and two weeks ago, this was catastrophic. I think it’s really hitting bottom and I think that … I mean, we’ve had a bottom, but now at $23 and $25 and probably heading up, at the same time, we save our energy and we also produce great cheap energy and we save our jobs. Yeah?"
2020-04-09,17:33,Unnamed,I want to ask you about the paycheck protection program because every day we’re hearing from small business owners who are telling us that their banks don’t know how to access this money. They’re trying to apply. They can’t figure it out. So where does the fault lie? Does it lie with the banks?
2020-04-09,17:46,Donald Trump,"I don’t think there’s a fault. They’re doing record numbers of dollars. They’re dealing with many community banks. They’re dealing with Bank of America, Citibank, a lot of … Wells Fargo, as you know, is very much involved and they’re dealing with, the bankers. Can’t go that quickly, but I’m hearing it’s a very, very successful rollout. They did want changes in applications, they want change in loan requirements, et cetera, but they’re taking billions and billions of dollars worth of loans and in the very near future, the banks will be relieving the money. They’ll be paying out the money. Yeah, please?="
2020-04-09,18:19,Unnamed,"Thank you very much sir. Are you still expecting the USNCA to take effect on July 1st and considering the fact that the auto industry is hurting these days, are you ready to postpone-"
2020-04-09,18:34,Donald Trump,"Well, we had the deal. Yeah. The deal is with Canada, deal is with Mexico. We have a deal and obviously the deal is different from the standpoint that production will be lower, but we have a deal. It’s a signed deal. It’s a deal that’s a … One of the worst deals that we’ve ever had was NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country anywhere. We’ll be terminating that, and the new deal is a great deal for our country, so that’s something."
2020-04-09,19:00,Donald Trump,"Now, again, we get hit by the virus and we’ll see where that all goes, but certainly car production’s going to be down for a little while, but ultimately good for our farmers, great for our farmers. We’ll be helping our farmers, by the way. We have money going out to our farmers in the pretty near future, having to do with … You see what’s happened, the farmers got hurt very badly by all of this. People are eating less from the standpoint that there’s no restaurants that are open. No businesses are open, no hotels are open. They’ll start to come back, but we’re going to be helping out our farmers. Yeah, please? Go ahead."
2020-04-09,19:36,Philip Weidman,Philip Weidman. Real Clear Politics. Earlier you mentioned project SkyBridge and we’re hearing that through that project a lot of the PPE that was sent out to other countries is coming back to this country. Do you know when we will be able to bring the majority of that back and then are you frustrated that USAID allowed a lot of that aid to go out the door in the first place?
2020-04-09,19:59,Donald Trump,"I’m not, because we’re in very good shape. You’ll be speaking with Mike Pence about this and a little while. You look at the hospitals, you look at what’s going on. I spoke to … Yesterday I spoke with the governor of Louisiana. I’m saying, “Do you think we need that extra 1,000 beds that we’re in the process of building?” And we are really in good shape. You’re not hearing people and needing ventilators much. In fact, we’re going to start helping other countries with ventilators. We’re going to end up having a lot of ventilators for future, should something happen for hospitals ideally to keep and have, but no. I think we’re in very, very good shape. We have calls with governors all the time and the governors in very good shape now. We have helped … We have sent billions and billions and billions of dollars between ventilators, equipment, protective equipment, masks. We have 500 million masks coming, 500 million from one group, 500. It’ll be 300 million and 200 million over a short period of time. Now I think we’re in very good shape. Please?"
2020-04-09,21:04,Unnamed,"President, speaking of testing, some experts, including Scott Gottlieb, have talked about 750,000 tests per week being needed before the economy has opened. Can you address that? Do you agree with those numbers? If not, how many tests per week do you think we should have, before the economy is needed?"
2020-04-09,21:23,Donald Trump,"Yeah. I don’t like using the word needed because I don’t think it’s needed, but I think we’re going to try and hit a number like that. That’s a very high number, but we’re going to be trying to hit it and we probably might be able to do that. Please go ahead."
2020-04-09,21:37,Unnamed,"Thank you, mister president. Today, the Democrats pushed for more rescue money for states and hospitals, which are complaining that they need it to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Do you think hospitals and states need this money, would you support that-"
2020-04-09,21:51,Donald Trump,"I do and I do support something, but I support it for the next phase. It’s much simpler in the next phase, whether that phase is infrastructure or whatever. So I’m going to leave you now with Mike Pence and with Eugene Scalia and if you would, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. We’ll see you tomorrow. We have a lot of … I think a lot of very big news to report. We’ve had a tremendous day between, I believe, what’s happening with the energy industry and, I believe, what’s happening with airlines. I look forward to seeing you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:05:28]."
2020-04-09,22:22,Mike Pence,"Well, good afternoon everyone. At the present moment, we have now cleared a more than two million tests across the country, and I’m pleased to report we’re testing more than 100,000 people a day now, but we’re working around the clock to scale up the new types of tests that the FDA has approved in record time. Every American can be confident that we’ll continue to build out that structure going forward for the weeks ahead and the months ahead. The present moment, there’s more than 450,000 Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus, and sadly more than 16,000 Americans have lost their lives. And as President Trump just said, our hearts go out to the families that have lost loved ones and I want to assure you that all of us working at every level understand these are not numbers, these are lives and are our heartfelt condolences during this heartbreaking week go out to every American family that’s lost a loved one to the coronavirus."
2020-04-09,23:41,Mike Pence,"It has been a difficult week, but as Dr. Birx will reflect in just a few moments, as we look at the data literally on a county by county basis every day, we continue to see evidence that that, in areas where the epidemic has impacted most, the greater New York City area, Louisiana, the Detroit Metro, the Denver Metro, we continue to see evidence of stabilization, and it appears, as Dr. Birx suggests that we are close to the peak in each of those areas so impacted. We also express gratitude and and appreciation for the people of California and Washington state who continue to be low and steady and the number of cases that are emerging there. We’re watching the Chicago Metro area, we’re watching the Boston Metro area, and as Dr. Birx will discuss, we just continue to urge every American to put into practice the president’s coronavirus guidelines, because all evidence indicates from the west coast what we’re beginning to see in major outbreak areas on the east coast, it’s working, America, and it’s working because you’re doing it and we encourage you onward in that."
2020-04-09,25:06,Mike Pence,"Now today, the White House coronavirus that task force met, but most of the team also met with Republicans and Democrats in two separate conference calls of the United States Senate. Secretary Mnuchen, our health experts, Admiral Polovchec, Dr. Hahn joined us as we discussed a broad range of issues. The treasury secretary touched on the paycheck protection program now in day five. Reporting $125 billion has been approved so far. 30,000 new individual users and 3,900 lenders are participating. We also discussed that the treasury department will issue a new frequently asked question document tonight, an FAQ as they’re known, to clarify how seasonal businesses can participate in the paycheck protection program as well."
2020-04-09,26:05,Mike Pence,"With regard to direct payments to Americans, the treasury secretary assured senators, and we assure every American that we remain on a timetable where the first payments and direct deposits will go out by the end of next week. For the average family of four, that’ll be $3,400 in direct financial support, and will no doubt be welcome news. Anyone who is interested in additional information on any of these programs can go to treasury.gov or sba.gov."
2020-04-09,26:38,Mike Pence,"Since we last spoke, I spoke with a Governor Laura Kelly of Kansas, Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky, also spoke to governors of Texas and Rhode Island. I assured each one of them as we continue to work through the process of making sure that we distribute the resources at the point of the need, at president Trump’s direction, our objective working through FEMA is to make sure that States have what they need, when they need it, and to see the progress that we’ve made, the president just reflected on in New York and New Jersey, Louisiana and the partnership we forged with governors in those states, California and Washington state before, [inaudible 00:27:21] gives confidence to governors and leaders of states across the country, most importantly our dedicated healthcare workers that we will be there to meet that need a should that a need arise."
2020-04-09,27:33,Mike Pence,"The present moment, FEMA reports the president has approved 54 major disaster declarations and states around the country have stood up 29,000 National Guard, 11,000 of which are fully funded by the federal government under title 32. Also speaking of our military, at the present moment, we receive a report today from the department of defense that 4,100 active duty military medical personnel have been deployed in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and they are personnel that are working on the ground at the Javits Center, working of course at the USNS comfort ship. But because at the present moment, the utilization of both of those temporary facilities has been fairly modest, the DOD actually worked with the city of new in New York to establish what amounts to a uniform temp service. They call it the bullpen. And today they literally deployed from the ship and from the Javits Center, 75 medical personnel to relieve dedicated healthcare workers within the hospital system in the city of New York, and we’ll continue to do that."
2020-04-09,28:49,Mike Pence,"We’re going to make sure those federal temporary hospital and Javits Center is fully staffed. We’ll make sure the USNS Comfort is staffed, but the physicians, those military personnel are going to be also be deployed across the city to bring much needed relief to our healthcare workers in our system. From the VA standpoint, we’ve opened up VA facilities in New York city, East Orange, New Jersey, Detroit, Michigan, and we are opening up the VA facility to coronavirus patients in Shreveport, Louisiana. Finally, I mentioned that today we exceeded more than two million tests that had been performed across the country. And also literally working with the US public health service, states around the country have stood up hundreds of drive through testing sites and just this week FEMA and the US public health service announced that we will give an option to states to transition from a federal testing site, dozens of which had been assembled around the country to a state managed site."
2020-04-09,29:54,Mike Pence,"I want to emphasize that this is an option. We believe it gives states greater flexibility to style sites or managed sites in areas that they think are most important, but we’re also processing requests for continued federal participation in states from New Jersey to Louisiana to Illinois, Colorado and Texas, and we want to assure people in communities all across the country that we’ll continue to partner with states to the extent that they prefer us to be a part of it. With regard to the Airbridge, three flights were scheduled to arrive today in Chicago and New York in Dallas, Fort Worth, 49 flights are scheduled over the next three days, and we continue to work supplies."
2020-04-09,30:37,Mike Pence,"We continue to literally leave no stone unturned around America and around the world and we’re literally in the process of acquiring tens of millions of supplies that are being brought into a distribution system, organized out of FEMA and focused on the areas most in need. We’re also bringing real innovation, and at the White House coronavirus task force today, we tasked the FDA and CMS to review the feasibility of allowing hospital workers to use cloth gowns for performing procedures. It was observed that 20 years ago, most physicians and most surgeons wore cloth gowns every day and laundered them, but it’s transitioned to disposable gowns, and we’re working very rapidly in the next 24 hours and we’ll have guidance for hospitals and healthcare workers about the ability to, in effect, recycle gowns and make sure that we have the supplies that we need."
2020-04-09,31:39,Mike Pence,"As the president mentioned today, the president and the first lady and I and my wife Karen were honored to be a part of a conference call with mental health from all around the country. And we know while there are families that are struggling with the coronavirus and struggling with heartbreaking loss to the coronavirus. We understand this is a very challenging time for every American, but most especially Americans who struggle with mental disorders or struggle with addiction. And the president brought some incredibly dedicated people together to make sure that they know we’re with them. Early on, the president expanded access to telemedicine. And we’ve also issued guidance for using technology to remain connected to social support groups. And we just urge everyone, everyone who may be feeling an emotional burden or a vulnerability during this time, to reach out to the many resources that are there and to know that you’re not alone and that we’re with you, and we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this together."
2020-04-09,32:45,Mike Pence,"So despite heartbreaking losses that continue this week in communities from New York to New Jersey to Louisiana, there are sounds of progress and hope, abounds. The reality is that we see new projections from the experts and if the projections are right, it’s because it’s working, America. It’s because the American people are putting into practice the social distancing, caring for their neighbors and their loved ones and their family members and putting their health first, and we just want to urge every American to continue to put those principles and guidelines into practice every day. With that, I’m going to invite Dr. Deborah Birx up for an update and Dr. Fauci, we’ll hear from the secretary of labor and we’ll take a few questions."
2020-04-09,33:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you mister vice president. So I wanted to cover today not only what we’re seeing across the United States, but some of the testing data to assure from the prior question, if we’re testing, I’m sure you’re following our numbers every day and the amount we’re going up, about 118,000 to 120,000 per day are being tested, so we’re way over the 750,000 per-"
2020-04-09,34:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So we’re way over the 750,000 per week, currently. We have some statistics. Now remember we required this, thanks to Congress, to be reported. We have about 75% of that test data and now about 1.5 million of those tests have been reported in. I just wanted to give you some ideas because sometimes we think that we’re only testing in the hospitals that this should give you an idea of the quantity and the types of tests that have occurred. So we’ve tested over 200,000 young people up to age 25, they have about 11% positivity rate, over half a million people between 25 and 45, they have a 17% positive rate. Now remember, in order to get tested, you have to have symptoms. So this gives you an idea of the number of people who have symptoms that are not infected with coronavirus. Another nearly half a million people between 45 and 65 their positivity rate is 21%, another nearly 200,000 between 65 and 85, 22% positive and a small group of about 30-plus thousand individuals over 85 and they have a 24% positivity rate."
2020-04-09,35:21,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so this gives you an idea of where testing throughout all age categories. I see a lot of men in the audience today. I just want to remind them about the importance of health care. Of the male/female ratio, 56% of the people who are tested are female, 16% positive, 44% male, 23% positive. So again, it gives you an idea about how men often don’t present in the health care delivery system until they have greater symptomatology. This is to all of our men out there, no matter what age group, if you have symptoms, you should be tested and make sure that you are tested. We appreciate you engaging in that. And also really recognizing the issues about co-morbidities and making sure that we’re addressing those."
2020-04-09,36:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I had a series of great calls with about 17 states that are in our more rural areas, specifically around our indigenous people and tribal nations It was a very reassuring call and you know we are testing across the country. We do have about 63% of states that have less than 10% positive despite significant testing. And within the indigenous peoples and tribal nations, they’re seeing the same thing that we’re seeing across the nation, increase issues around around those with comorbidities and those of elderly, but also issues in nursing homes. And they are testing, many of these states are still capable doing full contact tracing and so they’ve been doing contact tracing from nursing home outbreaks and other outbreaks. It really gives us a clear impression of no matter what we do in the future, we need to really ensure that nursing homes have sentinel surveillance. And what do I mean by that? That we’re actively testing in nursing homes, both the residents and the workers at all times. That is where, and that’s how we saw this at the beginning. That’s what we saw in Washington State. And that’s what we’re seeing in many of the States that have very low case attack rates."
2020-04-09,37:34,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The other thing that I want to leave you with, I mean we certainly know how desperate and difficult the situation has been in New York over the last few weeks, and we’ve been telling and talking about how this would be the week that would be most difficult because of the large proportion of cases that are coming from the New York Metro area. What’s been encouraging to us, those early states outside of Washington and California, which still have extraordinarily low attack rates because of their level of mitigation, all of the new areas that are having new increasing cases, we talked about them yesterday, Washington and Baltimore and the Philadelphia Metro area, that includes Camden, Wilmington, and the counties around Philadelphia. We’re seeing that the case number is what we’ll get to as far as attack rates."
2020-04-09,38:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We talked about one in seven in a thousand in New York that are being measured. These are coming in even with their progress of their curve in the one to two per thousand range. Showing that when you start mitigation early it has a very different impact. All of this data is coming together. The testing rates, the serial positivity, the age groups, who really needs hospitalization, ICU, the innovative pieces coming from, we heard a great report from Louisiana this morning on the phone call where they talked about a minimum now of 40% of people coming off of ventilators alive and leaving the hospital. This is very encouraging to us. Really shows amazing progress, clinically, at each of these hospitals, and the real lessons we’re learning and sharing across hospitals."
2020-04-09,39:20,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But really shows us that the original outbreaks were very large. But the newer ones that we talk about in Washington and Philadelphia and Baltimore, it looks like their attack rates and the attack rates in Denver and some of these other states that we had been talking about are much lower than New York and New Jersey. And this gives us hope about really understanding how to integrate this information together. Not dealing with a model, but the real-life cases that are occurring and understanding how to move forward together to really have a different future. So thank you very much."
2020-04-09,40:01,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much Mr. Vice President. So just reflecting about what we’ve been doing over the last few days. Remember last weekend when we made the forecast that this would really be a bad week, as I mentioned yesterday and the day before, it is in the sense of deaths a bad week. In fact, every day there seems to be a record of number of deaths compared to the day before. In fact, New York today had, again, another record of, I think the city itself was about 820-plus deaths. But what we were predicting with the increase and the real adherence to the physical separation, the guidelines that the vice president talks about, the physical separation. At the same time as we’re seeing the increase in deaths, we’re seeing rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalizations. Like I think yesterday was something like 200 new hospitalizations and it’s been as high as 1,400 at any given time. So that is going in the right direction."
2020-04-09,41:04,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I say that, and I always remind myself when I say that, that means that what we are doing is working. And therefore we need to continue to do it. I know I sound like a broken record. That’s good. I want to sound like a broken record. Let’s just keep doing it. I get questions a lot, Dr. Birx and I, about these numbers, the projections that you went from one hundred thousand, two hundred thousand, now down to 60,000. That’s a sign that when, as I keep saying, when you take the data you have and you reinsert it into the model, the model modifies. Data is real, model is hypothesis. Okay? So that’s what you have to do, and that’s what I think we’re seeing."
2020-04-09,41:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The other thing that’s some just broad, general good news from the standpoint of a scientific standpoint that there are a lot of candidate potential therapeutics that are going into clinical trials now that we’re sponsoring at the NIH. The kinds of clinical trials that would give us the answer, are they safe, are they effective, and just what is the capability of using them under what circumstances? As prophylaxes, as treatment in early disease, in late disease. So as the time goes by and we have the public health measures to try and contain this, we’re doing an awful lot from a scientific standpoint so that when we do get to next year, next fall, next winter, hopefully we’ll have something that we can offer in addition to the very important public health measures. So I’ll be happy to answer questions later."
2020-04-09,42:34,Mike Pence,Mr. Secretary.
2020-04-09,42:42,Eugene Scalia,"Mr. Vice President. Thank you and thanks to the task force, of course thanks to the President for his leadership. The important public health measures that have been discussed so much in these briefings in this room have had a large impact in American workplaces. We saw that again today as the labor department released figures showing that 6.6 million new unemployment claims were filed last week. We’re all mindful, the President mentioned this, that the American people are making it difficult sacrifices. That is included being furloughed, laid off, or having a small business struggle. That said, American workers can be encouraged by how swiftly and comprehensively the President and Congress have responded. Three weeks ago, the US had never had a law requiring paid sick leave at US companies, but three weeks ago the President signed a Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which did provide paid sick leave, as well as expanded family and medical leave for employees and small businesses. With those small businesses being reimbursed dollar-for-dollar for having provided that leave. Last week, we at the labor department issued rules to implement these leave requirements of the Families First Act and we’ve been in near constant contact with employers and employees to help them understand the law. And, in a number of cases already, to help workers get the leave that they were entitled to."
2020-04-09,44:17,Eugene Scalia,"Another unprecedented benefit for workers was provided in the CARES Act less than two weeks ago. That law, as you know, includes a $600 a week plus-up to unemployment benefits that are provided by the states. We have millions of unemployed Americans who are making a sacrifice for our national wellbeing. These bonus payments, and they’re unprecedented, the government has never provided a plus-up unemployment payment like this. These payments are intended to make those workers whole near as we can. This temporary benefit is available, not just to employees, but also to the self-employed and gig economy workers. Before the President signed the CARES Act, gig workers, independent contractors were not available for unemployment compensation, today they are. At the department, our team has worked day and night to enable states to make this benefit available. I’m pleased that a number of states are now making those $600 additional weekly payments. More states will follow in the coming days."
2020-04-09,45:22,Eugene Scalia,"How long it takes will vary by states. Some systems, some states’ systems will take longer, but we at the department will continue to support them. We have already dispersed half a billion dollars to states to help them with their systems and making these payments. We have another half a billion dollars that we’re ready to release. And for workers who don’t get this benefit when it’s first due them, states will be able to catch them up later when their computer systems are able to make these payments."
2020-04-09,45:54,Eugene Scalia,"Let me add that we’re also mindful at the labor department that many Americans remain in the workplace, including on the front lines in our hospitals as well as our emergency responders. My department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, has been providing guidance to employers and employees on coronavirus since the early days of this health emergency. We are fielding and responding to calls from workers worried about their health and sometimes from workers who believe they’ve been illegally disciplined by their employer for expressing health concerns. We will not tolerate retaliation. OSHA will continue to work with workers and employers to keep workplaces safe using all the tools available to us, including enforcement if needed."
2020-04-09,46:46,Eugene Scalia,"I wanted to finish by commenting on the Paycheck Protection Program, which we heard about earlier, run by the Small Business Administration. This, of course, is loans to small businesses to enable them to meet certain costs including utilities, rent, and most important from my perspective, payroll. As you know, if these companies receiving the loans keep their workers on payroll, these loans are largely forgivable. Here’s why that program is so important, from my perspective. We’re seeing unemployment filings right now of a like that we’ve never seen before. But these numbers aren’t the result of an underlying weakness to our economy. Our economy has been vibrant, incredibly strong just weeks ago. If, as we’ve heard again today, if we are disciplined now and adhere carefully to the guidance being provided by health authorities, we’ll get that economy back."
2020-04-09,47:44,Eugene Scalia,"The President spoke at the State of the Union of the blue collar boom we are experiencing. We want to lay the groundwork now for a blue collar bounce back. We’ll get there in part by helping companies hold on to their workers, which is what the pay Paycheck Protection Program does. Keep them on payroll so that when businesses are ready to reopen, they have the workers they need and Americans have jobs. We will continue, at the department and I know here at the White House, to be laser-focused on American workers and jobs until this is done. So thank you very much."
2020-04-09,48:20,Mike Pence,Very well done.
2020-04-09,48:21,Eugene Scalia,Thank you.
2020-04-09,48:21,Mike Pence,"Great job. Great. We’ll take a few questions. Yes, please."
2020-04-09,48:27,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. Vice President, I have a question for you and then a question for Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci., Just to clarify on the federal funding for testing sites in the states, are you saying that federal funding will remain for those sites and will it remain at its current levels?"
2020-04-09,48:40,Mike Pence,"It’s not merely federal funding, but in many cases we provided personnel from the US public health service and also flowed supplies, personal protective equipment that was required for some of the early forms of testing, but it’s less required today with new formats for testing. But it is an option and as I’ve made clear to several governors, we’ll continue to partner with our states. But I have to tell you that the way states stepped forward with the concept of drive-through and community-based testing is really inspiring. For our part, working with FEMA and our great team at US Public Health Service, we’ve stood up some nearly 50 different drive-through test sites around the country, but literally there are hundreds that have been deployed by states and by hospitals and local health care providers. But in this instance we wanted to at least give them the option to take control of that, but we’ll continue to resource them with personnel, supplies and any other support that they need going forward. And-"
2020-04-09,49:45,Unnamed (Reporter),"Just a question for the doctors, I’m curious, did you see this information out of the CDC in South Korea today that shows that they’re seeing evidence of reinfection in some people who had been cured of coronavirus? And what does that mean for our understanding of this?"
2020-04-09,50:03,Mike Pence,Have you seen that?
2020-04-09,50:05,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I’m not aware of what you’re speaking about now, but clearly there have been anecdotal mentioning of what appeared to be reinfection. You have to really be very careful when you say reinfection. And we were dealing with this with even Ebola back during the Ebola time, that someone might still, when that someone does a test on them, do a PCR on a body fluid of some sort and be able to detect what are likely nucleotides that are not replication competent. So if you’re telling me, which I don’t think they’re saying, that someone has coronavirus disease, they get sick, it’s documented, they get better. And then a month or so later they get sick with documented coronavirus disease. I don’t think that’s what they’re saying. But I don’t want to jump the gun on it until I see the data."
2020-04-09,50:58,Unnamed (Reporter),"They used the word reactivte, is that different?"
2020-04-09,51:01,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah. Well, yeah. What reactivating what means is that."
2020-04-09,51:03,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah, well, yeah. What reactivating means is that it depends what you mean by reactivating. If someone clearly is ill, and they have the virus isolated from them, that you may have a prolonged course. I’d like to see how long they reactivate. I mean, if they were sick and had documented virus, and then three months later they had documented virus. Is that reactivation or is that infection with another virus? I’d like to see the data before I really comment on that."
2020-04-09,51:31,Unnamed,"I wanted to ask about the medical criteria. You had a discussion with Dr. Birx and the other public health experts on Tuesday, I understand. Can you discuss what is the medical criteria that you guys are discussing in order to reopen the government? What is the medical care type criteria?"
2020-04-09,51:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, it’s less medical criteria than it is public health criteria, and I think it’s really important because often people say reopen the government like it’s a light switch that goes on and off for the entire country. We have a very large country with really different patterns of disease and outbreaks in different parts of the country, so it’s not going to be a one size fits all. It’s going to be, what is the kinetics of an outbreak? Is it on the way down? Is that essentially out? Is it still smoldering and possibly going up? I think you’re going to have to take it individually."
2020-04-09,52:30,Unnamed,Are there some benchmarks that you’re looking at though? I mean are there some numbers that you’re looking? Some data that you would like to see? What would you like to see before that happened?
2020-04-09,52:38,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah, well, I will allow Dr. Birx to come up. But just my own opinion, I don’t think there are going to be benchmarks that are going to be consistent from one to the other. For example, I would not want to pull back at all in New York until I was clear that that curve really was doing what we’ve seen in other countries, a very steep decline down. And we had the capability, if there was a resurgence, of having everything in place to be able to do the containment as opposed to struggling with mitigation with what we’ve been doing. That’s different than a relatively smaller city, town, or whatever in the Midwest or mountain regions, which is generally very well controlled. What I would want to see, do we have the capability of doing the isolation, contact tracing, and suppression of it? So it really varies differently. So I don’t think there’s one medical criteria, but Deb, if you want to speak."
2020-04-09,53:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you. So it’s what I tried to cover in the presentation I gave in talking to the 17 states that have indigenous populations and tribal nations, and discussing with them what they were doing generally, and what they were doing specifically through the Indian Health Service. They discuss the ability to find new cases and doing contact tracing. And so they have strike teams. They are very well organized. You don’t hear about them every day, and that’s why I wanted to call them out."
2020-04-09,54:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"They are really doing amazing work at their public health institutions, with their governors and their mayors. And they are in full contact tracing. Yes, they’re doing social distancing, but they’re also doing full contact tracing and understanding all aspects of their epidemic. So we’re looking at those pieces, as well as when I was talking about blunting, really when you’re starting to go up that curve, having that unbelievable blunting where you only get evident attack rates and I want to be very clear about that."
2020-04-09,54:44,Dr. Deborah Birx,"When we see cases, these are symptomatics that have been diagnosed. There’s clearly, we believe, people we don’t see. And that’s why the antibody test is going to be helpful to us to really define that. So those are the pieces that we’re bringing together to really analyze that. I did want to say the president talks about the 150 plus countries that experience what we’re experienced."
2020-04-09,55:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,I just wanted to do a call out. We have Americans around the world in every embassy that are working with those countries now. This scarf came from Africa. It’s one of my public health colleagues there. I just want to recognize the public health colleagues around the world who are doing all of this work together to change the course and their epidemics in every single country around the globe.
2020-04-09,55:30,Mike Pence,"Let me go to another question if I can, but in response to that, just so you know, what the President’s tasked us to do is there’s a number of working groups and that are looking at not only how do we reopen the country, but how do we stay open? And I think most of America knows that no one wants to reopen America more than President Donald Trump. But the President’s told us we need to do it responsibly, and we’re going to follow the data."
2020-04-09,56:03,Mike Pence,"We’re literally following the data on a county by county basis. This morning, we were literally presented with information of each county that had more than 100 new cases, and went in the other direction, had less than a hundred than the day before. It’s really remarkable and so I think what you hear the health experts saying will inform the President’s decision and timing."
2020-04-09,56:31,Mike Pence,"But make no mistake about it, that the best thing we can do to reopen America is put the Coronavirus behind us, to reach the end of that curve with as little loss of life or hardship as possible. To have in place that we soon believe we will, the kind of therapeutics, I call them medicines, that make you feel better by this summer. And to have more widespread testing that we’re scaling up each and every day, and also to have the kind of guidance that the CDC is even now developing for businesses large and small, for families, and for schools for that day that we do reopen America. Question, go ahead."
2020-04-09,57:14,Unnamed,"… Touches on this question of when to lean back on mitigation. There is a study out of Los Alamos this week that I hope you’ve seen. It’s on the CDC website. It looks at this question of Rnot, which is a technical term that you understand, that has to do with the reproductive rate of the virus. The study shows that the Rnot for coronavirus isn’t between two and three as had been thought before. It’s actually closer to six, which means that one person on average is infecting six others. So with this information, how does that impact the model? How can you begin to think about when to reopen society if it’s more contagious than we thought before?"
2020-04-09,57:49,Mike Pence,"Well, I can tell you as the lay person on the stage, we have known from the beginning that this is at least three times more contagious than the flu. And I believe that that fact alone has informed our projections and the modeling. But now, I’ll let the experts respond."
2020-04-09,58:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I’ll quickly and then we’ll tag team together. So when we’ve been talking about the asymptomatic group, and that’s why I gave you that testing data, where 11% of young people under 25 were positive, many of them very low grade symptoms. What we will be triangulating for you is the testing data with hospital admissions. And then you’ll be able to start seeing spectrum of disease."
2020-04-09,58:37,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Because what you’re not seeing in spectrum of disease is people who never even think that this is something significant, what they have. We’re seeing the significant cases. In testing, you can see that we’re getting a lot of people with symptoms, who aren’t positive. And so really finding out what is the are not? Is it six? Is it five? And the only way to do that at this point right now is to get the antibody tests out there and go into these places that had significant disease."
2020-04-09,59:08,Dr. Deborah Birx,"When we talk about attack rates of seven per thousand like New York, and five per thousand in New Jersey, and test the healthcare workers, the first responders, all of the nursing homes for antibody, and really get to your question, because right now it’s still theoretic. We understand they’re modeling this, and we will get the data to actually look at that. You will see what others have been presenting. So you presented the six. What others are presenting importantly is they’re modeling what’s happening with mitigation."
2020-04-09,59:41,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And they’re publishing that the Rnot with mitigation is approaching like 1.3 and 1.5. So think of what that is. If it was six, and then with mitigation we have it into the ones, that really the power of the American people. No one has varied Rnots like that without a vaccine. But this is what’s happening with really the power of the American people. Tony."
2020-04-09,01:00:08,Mike Pence,Tony. Yep.
2020-04-09,01:00:09,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Ditto to everything that Dr. Birx said, but I couldn’t help but thinking when you’re talking about it. You know what the worst enemy of an Rnot is? Physical separation."
2020-04-09,01:00:22,Mike Pence,I’ll go one more. I have one more. Go right ahead.
2020-04-09,01:00:23,Unnamed,"But do we have testing capacity in the country right now to reopen in the foreseeable future? I mean, because the President talkED about 2 million tests. Are we going to have the testing capacity needed to make Americans feel comfortable going back into their workplaces? I mean, it seems to me that is a pretty critical question at this point. People are not going to want to go back to work if they think their coworkers might be carrying the virus. We’re not testing enough. How do we know it’s safe to go back?"
2020-04-09,01:00:48,Mike Pence,"Well, I think the American people see the incredible progress that’s been made after President Trump brought in the largest commercial labs in the world to scale testing, the likes of which we’ve seen. We are, as Dr. Birx said, well over 100,000 Americans being tested every single day. We have an antibody test that is coming online. Abbott Laboratories literally has thousands of machines across the country. We’re working with hospitals and labs around the country to activate those machines for the 15 minute test and-"
2020-04-09,01:01:22,Unnamed,Do we have enough testing right now?
2020-04-09,01:01:23,Mike Pence,"Well, let me say we’re moving every day toward meeting that moment, but let’s be clear. Reopening the country as the President is very anxious to do at the earliest responsible moment, will be through a combination of facts. First would be that we are at the end of the Coronavirus for most major communities. Another piece of that is that we have therapeutics for Americans to take medicines if they contract the disease. Another piece of that is guidance from the CDC to public institutions, to businesses large and small, about how to conduct themselves in a safe and a responsible way."
2020-04-09,01:02:13,Mike Pence,"And testing is also a piece of that. And as Admiral Giroir has reflected, we are spending a great deal of time expanding testing today, every single day. There’s more and more tests across the country, but we’re also working to scale testing. As we move into this summer and move into the fall, we’ll have the testing we need to do what these doctors call not diagnostic testing, which is to take a test of a person that has symptoms, but surveillance testing, so we can identify people that may have had it and may be immune versus people that we just need to know whether or not they were never exposed and we’re not exposed. How about one more quick question here if I can. I think he had one right here. Or I’ll go to you in the back."
2020-04-09,01:03:07,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. In the next few weeks, the Supreme Court is said to rule on DACA on about the deferred action for childhood arrival. And about 30,000 of those people who are under that program are frontline healthcare workers. Is the administration in any way ready to protect them if the ruling comes in your favor and takes the protection out, and they can no longer work in the health field as they’re needed right now?"
2020-04-09,01:03:35,Mike Pence,"Well, I think the President has been very clear on his desire to reach a solution on that issue with the Congress. But let me say, whether it be healthcare workers or people working in food supply, other people working in critical infrastructure, we’re incredibly inspired by the way people across this country are stepping up to keep healthcare rolling and available, a high quality of care, even in areas deeply impacted by the Coronavirus."
2020-04-09,01:04:07,Mike Pence,"And also as we said the other day, hardworking people in our food supply, from the farmers to processors, to distributors, to truck drivers, to grocers. We received a good word that over the last several days, we’ve actually seen a significant drop with one major company in absenteeism. We issued a new guidance from the CDC about how people who may have been within close proximity to someone who had the Coronavirus could return to work before the 14 days if they didn’t have a fever, if they tested themselves twice a day, and returned with a mask."
2020-04-09,01:04:45,Mike Pence,"But the dedication of people to continue to work is truly inspiring. And I know as we go forward, we’ll work through a broad range of national issues, but we’re going to be incredibly proud for a long time by the way, people all across this country responded to this moment. So thank you all very much. We’ll see you tomorrow."
2020-04-10,00:24,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much everybody, and good afternoon. Today’s Good Friday and this Sunday, millions of Christians celebrate Easter and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. At this holy time, we pray that God will heal the sick and comfort the heartbroken and bless our heroes. As American families look forward to Easter, we’re reminded that our story ends not in despair, but in triumph and renewal."
2020-04-10,00:58,Donald Trump,"Very appropriate, isn’t it? I’d like to provide Americans an update on our ongoing efforts in the war against the invisible enemy. Before I do that, I’ll have a couple of notes. The United States in discussions last night with Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and in dealing with OPEC nations, we are trying to get Mexico, as the expression goes, over the barrel, and Mexico is committing to do a hundred thousand fewer barrels. President and I spoke last night, we have a great relationship, great friendship. They’re helping us very much at the border."
2020-04-10,01:40,Donald Trump,"They have 27,000 soldiers, Mexican soldiers on our border right now, stopping people from coming into our country as our wall goes up. We’re up to about 168 miles of wall. And in speaking with the president, they have a limit. The OPEC nations have agreed to a different limit reduction of about 23%. So what I thought I would do, and I don’t know that it’s going to be accepted, we’ll find out, the United States will help Mexico along and they’ll reimburse us sometime at a later date when they’re prepared to do so."
2020-04-10,02:19,Donald Trump,"And we had a great conversation, but we’ll find out how that all works out. As you know, they’re trying to get rid of the glut of oil. There’s a tremendous glut of oil and we don’t want anything to hurt our incredible industry, actually the largest producer in the world now. So we don’t want anything to hurt those jobs, those great jobs in Texas and North Dakota and Oklahoma and everywhere."
2020-04-10,02:43,Donald Trump,"We have a tremendous energy, New Mexico, tremendous energy business, and we want to keep those jobs. So we’re working on it. I think eventually it’s going to work out, may work out quicker than what most people thought possible and maybe it won’t, but it’ll work out eventually. Our experts are monitoring the data from every part of our country having to do with the topic that we’re here to discuss."
2020-04-10,03:13,Donald Trump,"In the midst of grief and pain, we’re seeing clear signs that our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives. A tremendous progress is being made. Although when you look at some of the numbers, I just spoke with Governor Cuomo, we had a good talk. When you look at those numbers, the numbers of death, people that have died, it’s so horrible. Now, on the other side, you have the numbers of beds being used. We’re just saying are substantially reduced."
2020-04-10,03:48,Donald Trump,"That’s usually the sign that it’s heading in the downward curve. So New York, we know where that is, but in the midst of all this grief and this pain, we’re seeing these signs and we’re seeing them very strongly, and a lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives. We’re saving so many lives compared to what it could have been. So nobody knows what the number is, but we had a number of 100,000 lives, as many as that is, it’s impossible to even think of it. And that was the low end with a tremendous amount of work and a tremendous amount of… you can call it many different things. Our people had to be extremely strong and brave to be able to put up with what they’ve put up with. But the minimum, if you did this social distancing and every other aspect, and I think I can say 90% maybe even more than that were able to do it."
2020-04-10,04:55,Donald Trump,"The minimum number was 100,000 lives and I think we’ll be substantially under that number. Hard to believe that if you had 60,000, you can never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking. So they said between 100,000 and 220,000 lives on the minimum side and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn’t do anything."
2020-04-10,05:22,Donald Trump,"But it showed just tremendous resolve by the people of this country. So we’ll see what it ends up being, but it looks like we’re headed to a number of substantially below the 100,000 that would be the low mark and I hope that bears out. The situation in Detroit and New Orleans appears to be stabilizing. Detroit is really started to go up and now it is stabilizing and New Orleans is a great place. I have so many friends there. They can’t believe what’s happening, but it’s really stabilized."
2020-04-10,05:58,Donald Trump,"I spoke with the governor of Louisiana and as you know, we’re building them additional beds right now, the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. And that is going to be done and I hope they’re not going to be very well used because I think they’ve really… I don’t think they’re going to need them or certainly not very many of them. We built them a big hospital of a thousand beds and now we’re in the midst of doing another thousand. I don’t think they’re going to be using very many of them and that’s a good thing."
2020-04-10,06:29,Donald Trump,"There was a time, two weeks ago when we said, that’s not going to be nearly enough. We’re going to have to build more, but we wanted to wait to see, and I’m glad we waited. It just looks like they’re doing really well. Louisiana and state of Michigan is doing really much better than we thought. In Washington State, we’ve made enough progress that the governor’s now able to return an army field hospital, so we’re going to take that hospital. We don’t think we need any more hospitals. We built thousands of beds all over the country and we think we’re probably not going to need that hospital anywhere."
2020-04-10,07:07,Donald Trump,"If we do, we’re ready to move it to a different location. In New York, we’re seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially. As I said in nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening, substantially suggesting that we’re near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working. Over time, our guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions and we’re seeing that. It’s incredible."
2020-04-10,07:39,Donald Trump,"I think with no exceptions, it’s looking like it’s lower. And again that’s because of the people doing what they had to do. Great people and working with elected representatives and the doctors, the nurses and everybody. I mean just everybody has been so amazing."
2020-04-10,08:04,Donald Trump,"I was told this morning again, please mention all of those people working in the grocery stores and it’s true, the checkouts and the clerks and the people that are really… and a number of those people have become infected. So we want to thank them and a shout out to them. With the tireless devotion of American doctors and nurses and all of the medical people, we’ve kept our fatality rate very, very low compared to other countries."
2020-04-10,08:35,Donald Trump,"My administration’s closely monitoring the data on the viruses impact on our cherished African American communities because they’ve been hit hard and the surgeon general will be sharing more of that information right after we’re finished here. He’ll be coming up and saying exactly what’s happening because it’s really, it’s very troublesome I will tell you that. I’d also like to provide clarity on the important point for many Americans on elective surgeries. Well, we’ve asked hospitals to cancel surgeries and procedures that do not take place at this time, just not to do them now."
2020-04-10,09:15,Donald Trump,"The choice to delay any treatment still remains between the patient and their doctor. We’re not advising Americans to postpone medical treatment that their doctor believes should occur now, so it’s different kinds of surgery obviously, but we’re really getting to the point where you can start to think about doing that surgery if necessary, pretty soon, I think pretty soon."
2020-04-10,09:39,Donald Trump,"Yesterday I directed Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue to expedite aid to American farmers and Secretary Perdue will be using all of the tools at his disposal to develop a program and very quickly of at least $16 billion to provide relief for farmers, ranchers, and producers impacted by the coronavirus. In this time of crisis, we must keep our supply chains moving from the beginning, right from beginning to end and we’re committed to supporting the amazing men and women who produce supply. I did last night a statement on social media and I said, “I have directed Secretary Sonny Perdue to expedite, help to our farmers, especially to the smaller farmers who are very, very badly hurting right now."
2020-04-10,10:31,Donald Trump,"I expect Secretary Perdue to use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal to make sure that our food supply is stable and safe and our great farmers are prosperous and continue to be prosperous. We’re working very hard to make sure our food supply chain is sound and plentiful, but we all know that that begins with our farmers, cattlemen, ranchers and producers.”"
2020-04-10,10:56,Donald Trump,"So we’re going to be working with these small farmers, the big farmers, the cattlemen, the ranchers, all of the producers. We’re going to take care of them. We’re working with them right now. We have a lot of money that was put there through our use of tariffs and other means and we’re going to help out our farmers. And I don’t think… I’ll tell you, I’ve been helping our farmers for a couple of years because they were targeted as you know, by China and others and I think they’re very grateful for what we’ve done. On the medical front, the FDA has issued 47 emergency use authorizations for advancements and testing, new ventilator designs, innovations and personal protective equipment and experimental medicines. And Dr. Hahn’s going to be talking about that. We’ve cut through the red tape to give doctors and patients unprecedented freedom to make their own healthcare decisions, granting access to potential therapies and drugs. Since Monday, we’ve deployed two major shipments of Hydroxychloroquine from our national stockpile and it’s going to various cities. And we are also disposing and getting as quickly as we can, portions of it to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense. And speaking of the Department of Defense, they’re going to be sending us 10,000,095 masks that they had and we’re in great shape in every way. We’re in great shape with ventilators. We’re in great shape with protective clothing. We have additional plane loads coming in, but we’re not getting any calls from governors at this moment. I can speak, I think for Vice President Pence will be talking in a little while."
2020-04-10,12:48,Donald Trump,"We’re getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything. They’re in great shape for this surge that’s coming in, certain areas in particular and that’s a good job. You’ve done a great job on that, Mike, really a great job. I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it."
2020-04-10,13:06,Donald Trump,"More than 2 million coronavirus tests have now been completed and we’re conducting approximately 100,000 more every day. We’re also working to bring blood-based Serology tests to the market as quickly as possible so that Americans can determine whether or not they have already had the virus and potentially have immunity. They have immunity if they’ve had the virus. A lot of them don’t even know if they’ve added. Sometimes it’s brutal. You see the Prime Minister seems to be doing well now I hope, he had a rough go of it and still is, but he’s doing better."
2020-04-10,13:43,Donald Trump,"And then some people don’t even know they had it. It could be sniffles, it could be they don’t feel perfect, but they’ve had it and they’re the lucky ones. The NIH, CDC and FDA are currently validating these antibody tests to ensure that they’re accurate and they’re doing that at breakneck speed. I think we can say that doctor, and we’re going to get them approved very quickly, Dr. Hahns."
2020-04-10,14:09,Donald Trump,"When validated, we’re confident that the production will scale up to tens of millions of tests very quickly. We are leading the world now in testing by far and we’re going to keep it that way. Other countries are coming to us and they’re wanting to know about our tests and can they buy the tests and can they do whatever they have to do to get the test. And we’re going to make that very soon. We’ll be in a position to make that possible because it’s important for them to have it."
2020-04-10,14:38,Donald Trump,"And we’re going to have an announcement on the World Health Organization sometime next week. As you know, we given them approximately $500 million a year and we’re going to be talking about that subject next week. We’ll have a lot to say about it. We’ll hold it. Every American should be proud of what our country is achieved in just a short period of time. The US Military has deployed thousands of personnel to build 23 temporary hospitals with more than 16,000 beds. And we have the potential to build many more if we needed them. We’re all ready to go, but I don’t think we’re going to need them, which is great. Great news. And we built those hospitals in 12 states and the District of Columbia using the Defense Production Act and we used it like a hammer. A lot of the media said, “Oh, we weren’t using it.”"
2020-04-10,15:30,Donald Trump,"We used it like a hammer to a point where all we had to do is say the words and everybody gave us max and they’ve done a good job. They really have done a good job with few exceptions. And we’ve harnessed the full power of American industry to produce ventilators and other essential supplies. Right now we’re making thousands of ventilators, many of which we won’t need, but we’ll use them in our stockpile and we’ll build that up. We’ll also help build up the stockpiles, which they should have had in the states."
2020-04-10,16:04,Donald Trump,"And so we’re working with governors on that and we’ll also help other countries or countries that are calling us for help. They need ventilators and there are no position to build ventilators. We are, we have Ford and General Motors and many, many companies are building ventilators. So we’re going to be helping at a not too distant point, we’re going to be helping quite a few of the countries."
2020-04-10,16:29,Donald Trump,"Now we’ve launched Project Airbridge to deliver nearly 300 million pieces of personal protective equipment from and around the globe. We’re also shipping out 60 sterilization systems to 10 different cities that can each sterilize up to 80,000 masks each day and I’m even hearing it can go up to 120,000 masks a day, certain equipment with certain additions. It’s a company in Ohio that makes it, it’s a great company. Great, I hear it’s a great product. Works very well. I asked that question. I said, “How come we have to buy so many masks? Why can’t we sterilize the masks that are being used?” And the answer was, you can. In this case, they say up to 20 times, so we can take a mask, certain types of masks, the N95s in particular, we can sterilize them, make them very clean up to 20 times. That’s a great thing."
2020-04-10,17:22,Donald Trump,"In addition, we passed the largest Emergency Economic Relief Package in American history to save the US economy and protect the American worker. As you know, this past week, which was four active days on the stock market, Good Friday today is not included, the markets are closed. In four days, we had the biggest market increase, stock market increase that we’ve had in 50 years. That tells you that there’s a pent up demand, that tells you they want to get back. There’s something good going to happen. I really believe that, there’s something very good going to happen. We have to get back."
2020-04-10,17:59,Donald Trump,"So think of it in this horrible period, this horrible, dark period where this monster came in and worked it’s horrible, horrible spell over the world. 184 countries as of this morning, 184 countries. We’ve done well and I guess the market thinks we’ve done well because we had the biggest stock market increase without one day."
2020-04-10,18:28,Donald Trump,"We’re talking four days instead of five that we’ve had in 50 years, 50 years. Think of that, more than 50 years actually. In short, the American people have launched the greatest mobilization of our society since World War II, deploying every scientific, governmental, medical, and military resource to defeat the virus. So I want to just start then with, we’re going to answer questions later. We’ll have time, if we have a lot of time today. A lot of people are off as they should be, Good Friday, but so I’ll stick around. We’ll answer questions later. I want to start with Deborah Birx, please. Dr. Birx and you can go over some of the numbers we just looked at and that’d be great. Thank you very much, Deborah."
2020-04-10,19:11,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for outlining how well we are doing in a series of metro areas. What also has been encouraging for those of you who are watching epidemic curves every day, and I’m sure you are, and watching them in log phase because that’s how epidemiologists like to look at their curves. You can see for the first time that in the United States we’re starting to level on the log rhythmic phase like Italy did about a week ago."
2020-04-10,19:38,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so this gives us great heart that not only in specific places but we’re starting to see that change. Obviously, a lot of that is driven by the improvement in New York city, remember for a long time they were over 50% of our cases and 50% of our new cases. That has dramatically changed because of the impact of what the citizens of New York and New Jersey and across Connecticut and now Rhode Island are doing to really change the course of this pandemic and really change the trajectory of new cases."
2020-04-10,20:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’re seeing that what many states and metro areas were experience as two-fold and four-fold, four-fold increases that went to two-fold that now those are going to eight days between the doubling rate. Watching this every day gives us hope across these metro areas from New York and New Jersey and all through Denver and of course through New Orleans."
2020-04-10,20:38,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We still see cases occurring in the Boston area and in Chicago, but their rate of increase seems to be stabilizing and we really want to call out the work of the mayors of Baltimore and the District and Philadelphia who have really brought all of their health experts together and working with their communities are starting to really change the curves in those areas. What we’re seeing is we’re united in social distancing and that’s been very encouraging to all of us and it should be encouraging to the healthcare providers that are on the frontline, many of which are serving our Americans with such dignity and respect in ensuring that everybody gets optimal care."
2020-04-10,21:22,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And as the President noted, our mortality in the United States is significantly less than many of the other countries when you correct them for our population. And that is really solely the work of our frontline healthcare providers. And so working with… You can really… hopefully you get the theme today that we are incredibly proud of our public health leaders at the city level, at the state level, at the federal level who are working together to really change the course of this pandemic, working with their citizens in their communities to make these changes and the American public who have really taken all of this to heart and stayed home."
2020-04-10,22:01,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I know last week we really asked a lot of people in the Washington and Baltimore area to consolidate, not go out frequently to grocery stores or pharmacies. You can really see that that’s having a huge impact. So it’s really about the encouraging signs that we see, but as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak."
2020-04-10,22:23,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so every day we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that because that’s what in the end is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side. We continue to really applaud the work of California and Washington State and Oregon. We’re learning from all three of those states, from their public health officials about how they were able to keep the virus from ever becoming logarithmic. And I think that’s an important lesson for all of us on how they did that, what the timing was in case we ever have to face this issue in the future. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-10,22:59,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Deborah. Tony, doctor, please."
2020-04-10,22:59,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. So again, just keeping on the theme that Dr. Birx had mentioned, this is the end of the week, that famous week that we spoke about last weekend in which we would actually was predicted to happen happened. We’re starting to see the leveling off and the coming down that Dr. Birx had mentioned, but it’s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation, that we need to be pulling back at all."
2020-04-10,23:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I was actually hearkened by the fact that we’ve been talking about the New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, and other areas where they have really big spikes, but there’s other parts of the country, and the middle parts of the country where they’re concerned to make sure they don’t get those spikes. And I really want to salute the governors of states throughout the entire United States, but particularly in the central part of the country because the governor’s awfully see us in these press conferences, and I’ve had calls over the last several days from several of the governors from Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah, just about an hour and a half ago."
2020-04-10,24:11,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I spoke with the governors of Arkansas and Wyoming who are really committed to make sure that they don’t get into the situation where they’re going to have spikes in their state. And they’re doing the kinds of things that they don’t get recognized because people don’t talk about them much. But we have a big country, we have 50 States, and it’s not only the big cities, so if we’re going to pull out of this, we’re going to pull out of it in the big cities and we’re going to pull out of it in those areas that aren’t as densely populated."
2020-04-10,24:39,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And I just want to give a shout out to them, they’re doing an extraordinary job. I was really pleasant… I wouldn’t say surprised because I expect it of this country, but to hear what they’re doing and the commitment that they’re putting in to making sure that we don’t have the kinds of situations that we’ve experienced unfortunately in other areas. This is very important. I just want to close by one other thing, something I mentioned yesterday and the day before, that there are a lot of candidate interventions that are going into clinical trials."
2020-04-10,25:09,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"For those of you who are interested in it, I recommend you go to clinicaltrials.gov and you’ll see the design of a clinical trial. And you’ll see that many of them are the randomized controlled trials that are the really gold standard of how you find out whether something really is safe and effective. And as the weeks and months, and it’ll probably be months sometime in the summer, we’ll start to see which are working, which are not, and to focus on those that are we developing and real working. I’ll be happy to answer questions later. Thank you."
2020-04-10,25:44,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Thank you, Mr. President. The White House Task Force has been very focused on increasing the supply of personal protective equipment for our great providers. I was one of those providers a few months ago and I can tell you nothing is more important than making sure they have what they need. So in order to increase the supply of N95 masks, FDA has worked with industry and has now authorized two companies who will supply machines to sterilize N95 masks."
2020-04-10,26:13,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Admirable Polowczyk and FEMA are purchasing on behalf of US government 60 sterilization machines, as mentioned by the president. And they will be positioned around the country to increase the amount of supply of N95 masks. Each machine will be able to sterilize 80, 095 masks and 95 masks per day and we hope to actually increase that further. The Vice President and the White House Task Force challenged us yesterday and we responded as a team, FDA issued revised guidance regarding the laundering of gowns because gowns are another issue in terms of supply that we’re looking forward on."
2020-04-10,26:51,Dr. Steven Hahn,"This is not something that normally happens around the country, but issued this guidance, it’s on our website now at FDA. So there’s information about how hospitals can do that to increase the supply. We’ve heard concerns that maybe hospitals might not want to do that because of regulations. And I can happy to tell you that [inaudible 00:27:07] and I have worked on this."
2020-04-10,27:10,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Certified providers and suppliers who follow FDA guidance as posted on the website will be compliant with Medicare and Medicaid requirements. And then finally, last week, FDA provided guidance to manufacturers on manufacturing specifications for cloth gowns. This is another attempt to increase the number of gowns, typically it’s plastic or other types of materials."
2020-04-10,27:35,Dr. Steven Hahn,"And this guidance, if followed, can be used by manufacturers to actually make these gowns and no further regulatory red tape will be unnecessary. They can go into circulation. Thank you."
2020-04-10,27:52,Jerome Adams,"Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon everyone. I started off the week talking about the challenges that lie ahead and I want to finish the week just by reiterating what you’ve heard. Mitigation works. It definitively and quantitatively is working and I want to say thank you to America for your efforts to help flatten the curve and to save lives."
2020-04-10,28:13,Jerome Adams,"But at the President’s direction, yesterday, I met with 2,000 Hispanic leaders from their communities. And today, the Vice President led a phone call that I was on with hundreds of African American leaders, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson, including Derek Johnson of the NAACP, including the National Medical Association and the Black Nurses Association to talk about some of the alarming trends we’re observing regarding the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. And you’ve heard the stats in New York City, Hispanics represent the majority of deaths in Milwaukee County. Blacks are 25% of the population, but almost 50% of the cases and 75% of the deaths."
2020-04-10,28:55,Jerome Adams,"So what’s going on? Well, it’s alarming, but it’s not surprising that people of color have a greater burden of chronic health conditions. African Americans and Native Americans… Excuse me, develop high blood pressure at much younger ages. It’s less likely to be under control and does greater harm to their organs."
2020-04-10,29:13,Jerome Adams,"Puerto Ricans have higher rates of asthma and black boys are three times as likely to die of asthma as their white counterparts. As a matter of fact, I’ve been carrying around an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years, out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack. And I hope that showing you this inhaler shows little kids with asthma all across the country that they can grow up to be surgeon general one day. But I more immediately share it so that everyone knows it doesn’t matter if you look fit, if you look young, you are still at risk for getting and spreading and dying from coronavirus."
2020-04-10,29:47,Jerome Adams,"The chronic burden of medical ills is likely to make people of color, especially less resilient to the ravage of COVID-19 and if possibly, in fact likely that the burden of social ills is also contributing. Social distancing and teleworking we know are critical. And you’ve heard Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci talk about how they prevent the spread of coronavirus, yet only one in five African-Americans and one in six Hispanics has a job that lets them work from home."
2020-04-10,30:12,Jerome Adams,"People of color are more likely to live in densely packed areas and in multi-generational housing situations, which create higher risk for spread of a highly contagious disease like COVID-19. We tell people to wash their hands, but a study showed 30% of the homes on Navajo Nation don’t have running water. So how are they going to do that? And some people of color experience both more likely exposure to COVID-19 and increased complications from it."
2020-04-10,30:38,Jerome Adams,"But let me be crystal clear. We do not think people of color are biologically or genetically predisposed to get COVID-19. There is nothing inherently wrong with you, but they are socially predisposed to coronavirus exposure and to have a higher incidence of the very diseases that puts you at risk for severe complications of coronavirus."
2020-04-10,30:56,Jerome Adams,"But as the Vice President shared on the call this morning, this history, and I want you to hear me say this, it does not have to be our nation’s future. We’re taking steps now in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic to reach, protect and strengthen all communities impacted by this disease and especially our communities of color. More details will be forthcoming, but we are actively working as the Vice President and the CDC director laid out today, data collection, targeted outreach to communities of color and increasing financial employment, education, housing, social and health supports so that everybody has an equal chance to be healthy."
2020-04-10,31:32,Jerome Adams,"And I want to close by saying that while your state and local health departments and those of us in public service are working day and night to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect you regardless of your color, your creed, or your geography, I need you to know you are not helpless and it’s even more important that in communities of color, we adhere to the task force guidelines to slow the spread. Stay at home if possible. If you must go out, maintain six feet of distance between you and everyone else and wear a mask if you’re going to be within six feet of others."
2020-04-10,32:04,Jerome Adams,"Wash your hands more often than you ever dreamed possible. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs and call your friends and family, check in on your mother. She wants to hear from you right now. And speaking of mothers, we need you to do this, if not for yourself then for your abuela, do it for your granddaddy, do it for your big mama, do it for your pop-pop. We need you to understand, especially in communities of color, we need you to step up and help stop the spread so that we can protect those who are most vulnerable."
2020-04-10,32:36,Jerome Adams,"This epidemic is a tragedy, but it will be all the more tragic if we fail to recognize and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and an array of other diseases and risk factors on communities of color. The task force and this administration are determined not to let that happen. The President, the Vice President has said, “We will not let that happen.” We can’t fix these issues overnight, but I promise you we will work with your communities to quickly and meaningfully move the needle in the right direction. Nothing less than the fate of our families and friends. My family and friends depends on it."
2020-04-10,33:15,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Good job, thank you. Mike, please."
2020-04-10,33:20,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met and heard from the President the gratitude that he and I, and I know all the American people feel for all the dedicated workers at FEMA, HHS, US Public Health Service, FDA, and all those that are literally working on your behalf around the clock to partner with states, to partner with local health officials. And Mr. President allow me to add my thanks and admiration to all of the entire team here at the federal level. On this Good Friday, we remember those who’ve lost their lives to the corona…"
2020-04-10,34:03,Mike Pence,"Today we remember those who’ve lost their lives to the coronavirus. We remember their families, our dedicated healthcare workers and our first responders. And we do well on this special day for Christians across this country to remember them in our prayers."
2020-04-10,34:19,Mike Pence,"But as you just heard from Dr. Birx and from the experts, it’s also a good day to remember that Good Friday is always followed by Easter Sunday, and there is hope. There’s hope in this moment that thanks to what the American people are doing every day, adhering to the president’s coronavirus guidelines for America. Thanks to the fact that Americans are listening to state and local leaders and putting the health of their family members and neighbors first."
2020-04-10,34:47,Mike Pence,"We’re getting there, America, we’re making progress. But it’s imperative that we all continue to implement all of the guidance in the 30 days to slow the spread. As the surgeon general just just attested at the president’s direction, we engaged more than 400 leaders in the African American community today and allow me to express my appreciation for their leadership and their efforts in communicating to African Americans and other minority population some of the unique challenges that those communities face in the midst of this epidemic. And the CDC as the surgeon general said, is working on not only studying the issue but very rapidly issuing new guidance, and we’ll be communicating that new guidance to all of those great leaders."
2020-04-10,35:31,Mike Pence,"On the subject of testing and supplies. The president gave a great amount of detail, more than 2.1 million tests have been performed. We continue to work very, very closely with FDA and suppliers around the country to expand the ability of testing and you just heard Dr. Huang reflect on the fact very soon we will have an antibody test that Americans will be able to take to determine whether they ever had the coronavirus."
2020-04-10,35:59,Mike Pence,"I spoke today to the governor of Colorado, Jared Polis. We’ve been in contact with Senator Cory Gardner about an outbreak at a particular meatpacking facility in the Colorado area. And at this time our team is working with the governor and working with the senator to ensure that we flow testing resources. At this point, there are some 14 people hospitalized, maybe 200 to 300 of the workforce have been impacted, and we spoke about providing those resources this weekend. And I want to encourage people in Colorado that we will work to support that effort. But I also want to emphasize that all the people that are working in food supply from farmers to meatpackers, to distributors, to truckers, to grocers, continue to have our gratitude, as President Trump said just a few moments ago."
2020-04-10,36:56,Mike Pence,"On supplies, more than 5 billion have been to the States. 29, 600 National Guard had been activated and at the president’s direction, more than 4,700 active duty military personnel have been deployed. Medical military personnel in nine States focusing on the areas of the most significant epidemic. Airbridge, 26 flights have been completed. Four flights are scheduled to arrive today, bringing a quarter million gowns, 25 million pairs of gloves. 54 more flights are scheduled, literally bringing in supplies from around the world."
2020-04-10,37:33,Mike Pence,"Finally, let me say as we go into this very special weekend into Easter services. I know I speak on behalf of the president when I say how grateful we are to all of the churches that have been there and their ministries have been working under great difficulty to continue to provide for the needs of your members. There’ve been food drives, there have been phone calls and ministry has continued and we are grateful for the role on this Holy Week that our churches, our synagogues and all of our houses of worship have played. On their behalf, allow me to remind you that even if you’re not in the pew this Easter Sunday, if you are able, it’s still a good idea to give because those ministries continue to go forward and we encourage you to continue to support them."
2020-04-10,38:27,Mike Pence,"We also want to say very respectfully to all the church communities around this country and all the places of worship to continue to heed the guidelines issued in the president’s coronavirus guidelines for America. We know it’s difficult in this time of year, particularly Mr. President, to avoid gatherings of more than 10. But we’re grateful that so many churches, synagogues, and places of worship have done just that and we urge you to continue to do it. And to my Christian brothers and sisters across the country, let me encourage you with the words that we should all remember that Jesus said, wherever two or more are gathered, there he is also. And so you can worship, you can celebrate Easter and know that you’ll be blessed in so doing and you’ll be serving the nation. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-10,39:20,Donald Trump,"Great job. Thank you. Okay. It’s Good Friday. Let’s be nice. Okay, let’s be real nice. Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-04-10,39:28,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President, can you clarify a little bit what the US offer to Mexico in order to agree to that oil deal? And then also go into detail about what you spoke about on oil with President Putin this morning?"
2020-04-10,39:39,Donald Trump,"All of the OPEC nations met and others and they’re all agreeing to cut back because there’s a tremendous glut. We don’t even… We’re filling up our strategic reserves. We don’t even have room to store it and in fact they are using ships to store oil. There’s never been anything like this. It was being overproduced to start off with and then you had the virus and that took off 40% right there. There’s a glut of oil like nobody’s ever seen before. It’s good in many ways and depending on where you are, who you are it’s bad."
2020-04-10,40:10,Donald Trump,"We have a tremendous energy business with hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re doing great. Number one in the world. So they all got together and they said we’re going to cut it because we have to get rid of this tremendous supply. Now the good news is gasoline prices, I’m seeing 90 cents, 85 cents in different parts of the country, a gallon. Nobody’s ever seen that. I guess you have to go back to the 1950s for that. The big large dollar bills. Remember? You don’t remember, you’re too young. But the fact that you have to go back a long ways to see it."
2020-04-10,40:43,Donald Trump,"So there’s some good, the airlines are trying to come back, having low fuel costs is good for them and other reasons. Steel manufacturing, but a lot of the steel goes to building what we do for the oil and engineering firms. So that’s a double edged sword. But we want to keep our energy, we want to remain independent. We will remain independent I think regardless, but we want to get rid of this tremendous overflow. There’s no place to even store it."
2020-04-10,41:11,Donald Trump,"So the OPEC nations met, they’ve been meeting and I’ve hated OPEC over the years. Absolutely hated them, but obviously it broke down and we potentially have years worth of supply, long time before it ever can catch up even if they do reduce it. And they agreed. But Mexico didn’t agree. It was one of the few countries that didn’t agree. This OPEC plus, these are OPEC plus countries outside. Do you understand? And Mexico didn’t agree. And I understand the president very well. He has a level when he came in and he wanted to keep it at that level. Oil is important for Mexico. The problem is, and I explained it very strongly, you’re going to be selling it for $5 or $10 a barrel, so in the end it’s bad. But he did have some political difficulty with it frankly, and I understand that too. And it’s a small amount for us, it’s a larger amount from Mexico, but it’s a very small amount for the United States being the biggest producer."
2020-04-10,42:08,Donald Trump,"So I agreed to pick up some of the slack. So he was going to reduce it by a 100,000 barrels, reduces output by a 100,000 barrels. And I was going to pick up the slack and they would make it up to us at a later date. They would make up what we’re doing at a later date. It could be in a different form. And I don’t know whether or not that’s going to… If Mexico was acceptable, I don’t know whether or not that’s going to be acceptable to the other oil producing nations. We’ll find out. But it’s something that would certainly be acceptable to me to get it over the back."
2020-04-10,42:38,Donald Trump,"So Mexico is going to reduce by a 100,000 barrels and that would mean that there are 250 to 300 barrels short. We’d make up the difference. They would reimburse us at a later date."
2020-04-10,42:51,Unnamed,You mean make up the difference by cutting US production?
2020-04-10,42:53,Donald Trump,"By cutting some United States. Now the US production had already been cut because we’re a market driven economy and oil is very market driven. They’ve been cutting oil all over the place. We’re cutting it back. And what does it mean really? It means that we have it in the ground, we can use it now. Now we have a lot of ground with a lot of oil in it. I think we’re number one in that too. We’re probably number one, especially with ANWR as I got ANWR approved IN Alaska. That’s one of the biggest finds anywhere in the world. So when you add it all up, I think we’re probably number one even in what we have under."
2020-04-10,43:26,Donald Trump,"We’re very lucky. We grew up in a land that was rich in a lot of ways, but it’s also rich because it has a lot of oil underneath, oil and gas. And as natural gas, LNG is all over the country now at a very low price. And our carbon, our atmosphere, the level of environmental cleanliness is at it’s all time best right now. All time best. Because we are using a lot of natural gas."
2020-04-10,43:55,Donald Trump,But we have many forms of energy including some of the newer forms that people want to see us go to. We have a lot of different forms of energy. We’re number one in the world. We want to keep it that way. So we’re helping Mexico out. We will be reimbursed in a form sometime in the future.
2020-04-10,44:12,Peter (Reporter),Mr. President I want to ask you about the new federal projections in a moment. But first today you tweeted “the invisible enemy will soon be in full retreat.” Given it’s invisible without widespread testing how would you know?
2020-04-10,44:24,Donald Trump,"I think that we’re going to have it in retreat. Will it be today? No. Tomorrow? No, but it will be at a certain point in the not too distant future it will be gone."
2020-04-10,44:35,Peter (Reporter),"And how do you do that without the widespread testing, specifically my question."
2020-04-10,44:36,Donald Trump,"We’ll know because people aren’t going to go to the hospital. People aren’t going to get sick. You’re going to know that with that, but we’re going to do very substantial testing. We’re doing more testing right now than any other country in the world by far. And if you’d like to have that question answered, I’ll have the professional answer it. Deborah, perhaps you could come up. We are doing tremendous testing. But you’ll know. You’re going to know before anybody because you’re going to see nobody’s getting sick anymore. It will be gone and it won’t be that much longer."
2020-04-10,45:01,Peter (Reporter),I’ll ask you about the projections after. Thanks Mr. President.
2020-04-10,45:04,Dr. Deborah Birx,Thank you Mr. President. So the testing. I want to reemphasize about what kind of testing we’re talking about. This is RNA diagnostic testing. That is the platform that was built to respond to this epidemic. It is the same platform that we utilize for HIV viral loads. And so many HIV clients have also given up their space on the machines to have these tests run for all of Americans.
2020-04-10,45:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"This assay is complicated. It’s not like an assay that you have for your other diseases, your strep test or other diseases like that. This is a very complicated assay that requires a lot of technical oversight and it’s part of the reason why not all 100% of machines are running at full capacity. But we had great discussion with the lab directors about that. Every day more are brought online, but I think we have to create expectations of what the daily test rates will be."
2020-04-10,46:02,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Last year we probably did 3 million HIV viral loads or 4 million HIV viral loads as a country. We’ve done almost 2.2 million in four weeks. So this is unprecedented in what we have to do. I think that’s why we’re working very hard for two pieces and I want to make sure that people understand testing is just part of our strategy. The other part of the strategy has to be this syndromic and influenza like illness where there’s an alert to an illness. And so that we’re surveying where we know the most vulnerable cases have appeared, and the great call that I had with the mayors and with the health officials yesterday and mayors today. A lot of the rural areas, their primary and as it was in Washington and California was at the nursing homes."
2020-04-10,46:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So the issue is to build a testing strategy that speaks to our strengths of laser focusing a strategic approach to testing when we know what our volumes are. And they increase every day, but we have to be realistic about what the volumes will be a week, two weeks, three weeks from now. And combine that with strategic surveillance so that we’re testing symptomatic people and their contacts very quickly to go back to contract tracing, utilizing our complete strategy. And I think we’re very much interested, and it’s why the president three weeks ago really put us on getting an antibody test."
2020-04-10,47:28,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I called from the podium for our university colleagues and hospitals to begin an ELISA based test because that’s a blood draw. But we really wanted a finger prick to make it easy and deployable. That’s what’s being worked on now. Of course we don’t want to promise until we have it because I think we deserve that. The American people deserve that. To have a test that is efficient, to let people know who’s been positive for immunity. That’s critical to epidemiologists and public health officials, to know what the penetrance of a virus was into a community when all you’re seeing are the serious cases and testing the most symptomatic. And so that’s a question that we still have."
2020-04-10,48:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Is this the tip of the iceberg or is this half the iceberg or three quarters of the iceberg? What we have seen to date. And we have, I just want to complete the thought by saying in the areas where we had an outbreak, these large metros, Louisiana, Denver, Detroit, Chicago, New York, New Jersey, by per capita we’ve done more tests than any other place in the world. That was intentional. We focused the tests where the need was the greatest and the burden of disease the greatest, and now we’re trying to really see how strategically that very valuable resource can be utilized around the countries to create a mosaic of testing combined with surveillance."
2020-04-10,48:54,Peter (Reporter),"Can I ask you about the new federal projections? There’s new reporting today, the new federal projections suggest-"
2020-04-10,48:57,Donald Trump,Want to ask who?
2020-04-10,48:59,Peter (Reporter),I’d like to ask you if I can about the new federal projections that suggest lifting the 30 day shelter in place orders would lead to a spike in infections. Have you seen those new projections from your Department of Homeland Security and HHS?
2020-04-10,49:14,Donald Trump,When did they say this would take place? When?
2020-04-10,49:16,Peter (Reporter),They said that it would take place if the 30 day shelter in place were to be removed. There are three different examples.
2020-04-10,49:21,Donald Trump,"We’ll talk about that. Doctor, would you like to talk about that."
2020-04-10,49:24,Peter (Reporter),"Is that your thinking, though that those-"
2020-04-10,49:24,Dr. Deborah Birx,We haven’t seen [crosstalk 00:49:25].
2020-04-10,49:26,Donald Trump,They haven’t seen it. I guess they leaked it to NBC.
2020-04-10,49:30,Peter (Reporter),They didn’t leak it to us. It’s being reported by others.
2020-04-10,49:31,Donald Trump,But nobody’s seen it and they’re the ones are doing it.
2020-04-10,49:34,Peter (Reporter),"It’s your administration, so I asked. It’s from the HHS and DOJ. I’ll circle back-"
2020-04-10,49:38,Donald Trump,We’ll with find out about it. They don’t know about it. Do you want to say something?
2020-04-10,49:44,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"First of all, Peter, I haven’t seen that, so I can’t quote on that."
2020-04-10,49:47,Peter (Reporter),The New York Times just reported it within the last [crosstalk 00:49:49].
2020-04-10,49:49,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That’s okay. I still haven’t seen it, I’ve been in here all day."
2020-04-10,49:52,Peter (Reporter),I’m just telling you what I [crosstalk 00:49:54].
2020-04-10,49:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What I think that they’re talking about is that whenever you pull back, you would expect that you might start seeing cases. And what we’ve been talking about, what Dr. Birx has just mentioned, is that when you see that, that’s where you want your resources to be able to very efficiently in real time, identify, isolate and contact trace. So don’t let anyone get any false ideas that when we decide at a proper time when we’re going to be relaxing some of the restrictions, there’s no doubt you’re going to see cases. I would be so surprised if we did not see cases. The question is how you respond to them. I think that’s what they were referring to."
2020-04-10,50:30,Peter (Reporter),"I guess the question, Mr. President, should Americans have to decide between staying healthy and going back to work?"
2020-04-10,50:37,Donald Trump,"I think we’re going to do both. We’re going to go back to work and we’re going to stay healthy, and staying healthy is also a proportion. If you look at what we’re doing, we’re looking at a date. We hope we’re going to be able to fulfill a certain date, but we’re not doing anything until we know that this country is going to be healthy. We don’t want to go back and start doing it over again, even though it would be in a smaller scale. Yeah. Jeff, go ahead."
2020-04-10,50:59,Jeff (Reporter),"Thank you, sir. Just a follow up on the oil question. The president of Mexico said that you had agreed that the US would cut production by 250,000 barrels per day. Is that what you agreed to?"
2020-04-10,51:09,Donald Trump,"Yes, which we’ve already done by the way. But we would agree to a reduction cut. They would agree to do something to compensate us in the future."
2020-04-10,51:19,Jeff (Reporter),"Do you make any assurances to Saudi Arabia that you, the United States would not bail out oil drillers here?"
2020-04-10,51:27,Donald Trump,"We didn’t discuss that with Saudi Arabia. We just discussed the numbers and we discussed who’s opposed and who’s not, and pretty much everybody is in favor of it because they’re getting clobbered, they’re all getting clobbered. All of those countries are having problems. If you look at Saudi Arabia, that’s their source of income. Primary source of income by far. So they want to do it. Russia wants to do it. The OPEC nations want to do it. They All want to do it. So we’ll see what happens. There’s a difference between wanting to do it and doing it. Yeah, go ahead. OAN, in the back."
2020-04-10,51:57,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President. This is a national security question back to Venezuela and China. Your administration has placed a $15 million bounty on Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro, and we have news this morning that president Xi is talking with Nicholas Maduro expressing his financial support for Maduro. So two questions. One, have you discussed with President Xi the US policy on Maduro; and two, how does this affect US policy with regards to it’s war on anti [crosstalk 00:00:52:33]?"
2020-04-10,52:32,Donald Trump,"We will not be happy if that takes place. I have not spoken to President Xi of China about Venezuela, about that aspect of Venezuela, but if that took place, we will not be happy. Okay. I will not be happy."
2020-04-10,52:44,Unnamed,Are you concerned that he’s opening up another financial avenue?
2020-04-10,52:48,Donald Trump,"I’m concerned about everything. That’s why I don’t sleep a lot. I get myself concerned about everything, but I would not be happy about that. Go ahead."
2020-04-10,52:57,Unnamed,"Mr. President, getting back to Peter’s question, a variation of that question., Your doctors who are gathered here seem to be in doubt as to whether or not the country could reopen on May the 1st, if they come to you before May the 1st and say the country is not ready or huge parts of the country are not ready to reopen on May the 1st will you listen to them?"
2020-04-10,53:18,Donald Trump,"I listen to them about everything? I think they’re actually surprised. I have great respect for these people. All of them. [crosstalk 00:53:25] And others that are working with us. I have great respect for this group. In fact, I told Tony Fauci, I said, “Why don’t you move to New York? Run against AOC. You will win easily.” So he decided that he’s not going to do that? I kid, by the way. You know this."
2020-04-10,53:41,Unnamed,"Some of your allies have been bashing these doctors, would you tell them to cut it out?"
2020-04-10,53:47,Donald Trump,"I can only say this. I have tremendous respect for these people and we’ve done very well and when you look at us compared to others, we’re a big nation. When you look at us compared to others, when you see how we’ve taken testing from a broken system that I inherited to having the best tests that anyone’s made anywhere in the world and other countries are calling us wanting to use our technology. I have great respect for these people. I’m never saying bad about this."
2020-04-10,54:13,Unnamed,"If they come back to you sir and say “Before may the 1st we can’t open on May the 1st, do you listen?"
2020-04-10,54:19,Donald Trump,"I will certainly listen, I will certainly listen. There are two sides. Remember I understand the other side of the argument very well because I look at both sides of an argument. I will listen to them very carefully though. Please go ahead."
2020-04-10,54:32,Unnamed,"Thank you. Mr. President, you may have seen this, but JP Morgan came out with a forecast about GDP growth in the second quarter and they’re saying a 40% decline in the second quarter of this year. Do your economic advisors share that view?"
2020-04-10,54:46,Donald Trump,"I think my economic advisers are interested in the third quarter and really the fourth quarter. And I think we have a chance to do record fourth quarter numbers because there’s a tremendous pent up demand. And you see it this week. What reason would there be other than faith in us and in this country, faith in this group and me and our vice president and everybody, governors perhaps, you can add them into it also. What reason would there be in a shortened week, four days instead of five to have the biggest stock market gain in over 50 years? So I think that to me there’s a sign."
2020-04-10,55:24,Donald Trump,"Look with all we’ve been down, we’ve never been hit, I don’t know, has this country ever been hit like this? Probably not. 1917 but that was different. It was a different time and frankly Europe took the brunt of it. We didn’t, but it was a terrible time also, but probably never been hit like this. Somebody was saying."
2020-04-10,55:44,Donald Trump,"In fact, I was speaking with Governor Cuomo about it because we were in New York City, a place we love New York State with the World Trade Center, and that was approximately 3,000 people. Well we’ve doubled that in this same area. We’ve doubled that, more than double it. Substantially more. And it’s obviously going. We had our highest number yesterday and the day before."
2020-04-10,56:07,Donald Trump,"With all of this news, what would lead you to believe that we’re going to have the best stock market week, shortened week, in 50 years. Almost broke the all time record. You know what that is? That’s a pent up demand now. That’s my opinion. The other thing is we’re doing tremendous stimulus plans and despite what you reading, there’s back and forth, but we are getting along with the Democrats. They want to see something happen. We have to help our workers, we have to help our small businesses. We have to help our restaurants. I think deductibility will be great for entertainment, restaurants, all of that."
2020-04-10,56:40,Donald Trump,"Look, I think with the stimulus, with the people, with what we’ve got going with all of the things, we’re going to be meeting with the airlines over the weekend. We have a great plan for the airlines. We’ve got to keep the airlines going. It’s never been a great business, but it’s a very vital business for the country. We’re going to be meeting with Boeing, we’re going to be meeting with a lot of companies that are great companies and were great companies a short while ago. We can’t let anything happen to Boeing. It’s got so much potential. You talk about potential, can anything have more potential than that?"
2020-04-10,57:15,Donald Trump,"So we have a lot of very exciting things taking place. We have tremendous plans, we have tremendous stimulus. And I think we have a chance to do really well. So this quarter isn’t the quarter I’m looking at. Third quarter we start to think about it, and I think fourth quarter is going to be at a level that maybe we haven’t seen before. I think our country, with the stimulus, with all that we’ve been through, we’ve learned a lot. Don’t forget, we’ve about pandemics and epidemics. We’ve learned a tremendous amount, and with all that we’ve learned… As an example, we’re making ventilators. We have thousands of them being delivered in the very near future. We have countries calling us. ” Can we have ventilators?” That would’ve been an unthinkable call. I wouldn’t know what to say. They have people dying, but we needed them for ourselves."
2020-04-10,58:08,Donald Trump,"We have plenty before the surge. In New York, they need far fewer hospital rooms or far fewer hospital beds in particular than we thought. And I have to say, Dr. Birx told me that four weeks ago, six weeks. I remember you said “That number is too high. We don’t need that many.” And based on what she said and others, we did what we had to do. We actually gave the maximum. We built Javits, we sent the ship in. We then made the ship COVID because there weren’t a lot of people on the roads. You didn’t have the accidents that we thought, other unrelated accidents, nobody driving. Normally you have a lot of car accidents, you have a lot of motorcycle accidents. You have people going to the hospital. We didn’t have that. We had almost none of it, so a lot of things have happened."
2020-04-10,58:55,Donald Trump,"I think we have a chance to be stronger than before. I really do. I think the stimulus is very important to what we’re doing. I think it’s very, very important. Please, go ahead."
2020-04-10,59:05,Unnamed,"Mr. President may I ask you about credit and debt as well. Many American individuals and families have had to tap their credit cards during this period of time and businesses have had to draw down their credit lines. Are you concerned, Mr. President, that that may hobble US economy, all of that debt, number one? And number two, would you suggest to credit card companies to reduce their fees during this time?"
2020-04-10,59:29,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s something that we’ve already suggested. We’re talking to them. Business interruption insurance. I’d like to see these insurance companies. You have people that have paid, when I was in private I had business interruption. When my business was interrupted through a hurricane or whatever it may be, I’d have business where I had it. I didn’t always have it. Sometimes I had it. Sometimes I have a lot of different companies. But if I had it, I’d expect to be paid."
2020-04-10,59:54,Donald Trump,"You have people, I speak mostly to the restaurateurs where they have a restaurant they’ve been paying for 25, 30, 35 years. Business interruption, they’ve never needed it. All of a sudden they need it. And I’m very good at reading language. I did very well in these subjects. And I don’t see the word pandemic mentioned. Now some cases it is, it’s an exclusion, but in a lot of cases I don’t see it. I don’t see a reference and they don’t want to pay up. I would like to see the insurance companies pay if they need to pay if it’s fair. And they know what’s fair and I know what’s fair. I can tell you very quickly."
2020-04-10,01:00:31,Donald Trump,"But business interruption insurance, that’s getting a lot of money to a lot of people and they’ve been paying for years. Sometimes they just started paying. But you have people that have never asked for business interruption insurance and they’d been paying a lot of money for a lot of years for the privilege of having it and then when they finally need it, the insurance company says we’re not going to give it. We can’t let that happen. Please, go ahead."
2020-04-10,01:00:55,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. On March 6 you said anyone who wants tests can get a test. Now you’re saying that you would be open to reopening the government without having a national testing system. How do you square those two statements given that there are still issues with testing going forward and how can you tell people [crosstalk 01:01:14]?"
2020-04-10,01:01:13,Donald Trump,"There are not a lot of issues with this. I got it. There’s not a lot, and it’s a good question. There’s not a lot of issues with testing. Certain sections of the… We go to Iowa, we go to Nebraska, we go… And interestingly Idaho is very interesting because they had a few breakouts, small breakouts, but they are very, very capable states, and they’re big distances. A lot of land, a lot of opening."
2020-04-10,01:01:38,Donald Trump,"You don’t need testing there. Where you have a state with a small number of cases, some states with almost none. West Virginia hung in for a long time, as with none for a long time. So when you have that, you don’t need testing. You don’t have to test every person in the state of Iowa as an example. You don’t have to test every single person to say, “Let’s open up and let’s get the tractors moving and let’s get the corn” and let’s open up all of the different things they do in that great state. You don’t need that."
2020-04-10,01:02:11,Donald Trump,"With that being said, if there’s a little hot corner someplace, we’ll be testing, but I think Deborah speaks to this very well. Same thing in New York. That’s what we talked to Governor Cuomo about this morning. We have the Abbott test, which is very quick and very easy. It goes very fast. Then we have a lesser test that we talked about where we can talk about a larger area. So we’re going to do testing, but you don’t need to test 325 to 350 million people because, number one, it’s unnecessary. Vast numbers, vast areas of our country don’t need this. I think you agree with me on that. You just don’t need it."
2020-04-10,01:02:53,Donald Trump,"Now we have certain hotspots, so Louisiana’s a hotspot, New York’s a hotspot, Detroit’s a hotspot. And then you have certain areas in certain hotspots that you have to even go more so. And we’re doing all of that. Remember this, we’ve done more testing than any country in the world and we have the best test and we developed this over a very short period of time. Please."
2020-04-10,01:03:12,Unnamed,"Can I ask you also about the African American disparity? I have a question for you and a question for the Surgeon General. For you, Mr. President, we know that these health disparities have existed for a long time among African Americans, Latinos, and other people of color. Why did the administration possibly have a plan directed at those communities to prevent high death rates knowing that the health disparities were there?"
2020-04-10,01:03:34,Donald Trump,Well we do have a plan and one of the things I’m most proud about is what I’ve been able to do for the African American community. The lowest job numbers in the history of our country.
2020-04-10,01:03:45,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:03:45] the virus.
2020-04-10,01:03:46,Donald Trump,"Just before the virus came. Well, I’m just saying, because this has been here for three weeks. So just before, African American community had the lowest unemployment, the best employment numbers, more African American people and communities have been thriving. If you look at our opportunity zones and what we did, Tim Scott, who is a fantastic Senator, came to me, opportunity zones. More jobs for African Americans than ever before. Better healthcare than they’ve ever had before. All of these things. The surgeon general spoke to it and he spoke to it, I thought really brilliantly. I found it very interesting what he said. And I’d love you to come up and answer the second part of her question because I think you would do a much better job than I would please."
2020-04-10,01:04:33,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. Surgeon General. I have a quick question for you. You said that African Americans and Latinos should avoid alcohol, drugs and tobacco. You also said do it for your abuela and do it for big mama and pop pop. There are some people already-"
2020-04-10,01:04:46,Jerome Adams,I said granddaddy too.
2020-04-10,01:04:47,Unnamed,There are some people online that are already offended by that language. And the idea that you’re saying behaviors might be leading to these high death rates. Could you talk about whether or not people… Could you I guess have a response for people who might be offended by the language that you used?
2020-04-10,01:04:59,Jerome Adams,"Well I used that language because that’s the… I had been meeting with the NAACP, with the National Medical Association, with others. I actually talked with Derek Johnson multiple times this week, the head of the NAACP. And we need targeted outreach to the African American community. And I used the language that is used in my family. I have a Puerto Rican brother-in-law. I call my granddaddy granddaddy. I have relatives who call their grandparents big mama."
2020-04-10,01:05:29,Jerome Adams,"So that was not meant to be offensive. That’s the language that we use and that I use and we need to continue to target our outreach to those communities. It is critically important that they understand it’s not just about them and I was very clear about that. It’s not just about what you do, but you also are not helpless. We need to do our part at the federal level. We need people to do their parts at the state level and we need everyone black, brown, white, whatever color you are to follow the president’s guidelines, the coronavirus guidelines, and do their part because when I talked to the NAACP three weeks ago, it’s important to note that one of the things they asked me was can you help dispel the myths in this community that people actually can’t get coronavirus if they’re black. That was a myth that was out there that’s actually very important for us to squash here."
2020-04-10,01:06:15,Unnamed,"So you recommend that all Americans avoid tobacco, alcohol and drug use at this time?"
2020-04-10,01:06:21,Jerome Adams,"Absolutely. Yeah. It’s especially important for people who are at risk and with co-morbidities, but yes, all Americans. So thank you. And I will clarify that. All Americans need to avoid these substances at all times. I put out a smoking cessation report in January. I put out an advisory against youth and pregnant women using marijuana last year and that was not directed towards any one race. That’s everybody needs to do everything they can to be as healthy as possible at this critical time. Dr. Fauci, can you add anything?"
2020-04-10,01:06:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I think you said it perfectly, Jerome. Thank you."
2020-04-10,01:06:49,Donald Trump,Would you like to add anything to it because you expressed it very beautifully before.
2020-04-10,01:06:56,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Jerome, you did it beautifully. I can’t do it any better than that. And I know Jerome personally and I can just testify that he made no, not even a hint of being offensive at all with that comment. I thought that was appropriate. Thanks."
2020-04-10,01:07:12,Donald Trump,"And I can tell you Jerome has done a fantastic job. Our surgeon general, I just hope nobody steals him and he goes to one of these big companies for a fortune. Don’t leave us. Don’t leave us Jerome."
2020-04-10,01:07:23,Jerome Adams,"Happy serving the people, sir."
2020-04-10,01:07:24,Donald Trump,"He’s doing a great… You are happy and you’re doing a great job. And everybody tells me that too, so we appreciate it. Please."
2020-04-10,01:07:32,Unnamed,Thank you. So Google and Apple have announced that they are jointly enabling contact tracing on their mobile phone operating systems. And I’m wondering if this is something that you would consider or maybe the doctor would consider?
2020-04-10,01:07:45,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:07:45] problems and a lot of other things. Is it something we’re going to look at it, certainly, and we know they’ve done that. And it’s highly, it’s very new, new technology. It’s very interesting. But a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person’s freedom. We’re going to take a look at that, a very strong look at it. We’ll let you know pretty soon."
2020-04-10,01:08:02,Unnamed,And I have another question.
2020-04-10,01:08:03,Donald Trump,Brand new. Yes?
2020-04-10,01:08:03,Donald Trump,"… had a very strong look at it. We’ll let you know pretty soon. Brand-new. Yes, please."
2020-04-10,01:08:04,Unnamed,So can you explain why it is appropriate in the middle of a pandemic to be talking about cutting or eliminating funding for the World Health Organization?
2020-04-10,01:08:14,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to talk about the WHO next week, in great detail. I didn’t want to do it today, Good Friday. I didn’t want to do it before Easter. I also didn’t want to do it before we have all the facts. But over the years, many years, we’ve been paying them from 300 to 500 and even more million dollars a year. China’s been paying them less than 40 over the years. So we’re paying them more than 10 times more than China. And they are very, very China-centric, as I said during the weeks, China-centric. China always seems to get the better of the argument and I don’t like that. I really don’t like that. I don’t think that’s appropriate. I don’t think it’s fair to the American people. I’d tell that to President Xi. I’d tell that to Dr. Tedros. I spoke to him one time. I think he’s a very nice man. I liked him, but we’re going to be talking about that next week, in great detail. We’re looking at it very, very closely."
2020-04-10,01:09:18,Donald Trump,"We want to make sure money is properly spent. But again, why is the United States paying $500 million a year? That’s a lot. That’s a lot. And why is China paying last year, this year, $42 million? But generally under 40, so it’s in the 30s. So we’re at 500, 452, 400, 401, different amounts, different years, and they’re at 40, 38, 36, 35, 32, 31."
2020-04-10,01:09:49,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:01:54].
2020-04-10,01:09:54,Donald Trump,"No, no. But you have to ask yourself that question and then the answer always turns out to be in China’s favor. Well, I have the same thing with the World Trade. Isn’t that interesting? World Trade. So we have World Health and we have World Trade, so we have the World Trade Organization. And until I came along we were losing cases, so many cases, it was ridiculous. We were always losing these cases. I mean, almost every case. And now we’re winning cases. We just won $7 billion because they know I’m not going to put up with it."
2020-04-10,01:10:25,Donald Trump,"China has been unbelievably taken advantage of us and other countries, since they’re considered a developing nation. I said, well then make us a developing nation too. They get big advantages because they’re a developing nation. India, a developing nation. The United States is the big developed nation. Well, we have plenty of development to do. Okay? And now we’re winning cases because they know that if we’re not treated fairly, I’m going to pull out. Now, you never heard this before because nobody ever talked about the World Trade Organization, but the World Trade Organization has treated us very unfairly. But they know I’m not going to put up with it because all of these countries are taking advantage of the United States."
2020-04-10,01:11:09,Donald Trump,"Now, in the courts, and the court system, we’re not approving new judges, over the last year and a half. We’re not going to approve them. And Bob Lighthizer is working very hard on that. But we had always a minority position, meaning numbers of judges. So we’d have a minority number of judges. I said, how do you win with a minority number of judges? But all of a sudden we’re winning and the reason we’re winning is they know if they don’t treat us properly… And we won $7 billion just this very recently, and the money is pouring in. And we won other cases too. We want a lot of cases."
2020-04-10,01:11:44,Donald Trump,"But you know from covering it, I know you know, that the United States was taken advantage of by the World Trade Organization. And by the way, speaking of China, if you look at the history of China, it was only since they went into the World Trade Organization that they became a rocket ship with their economy. They were flatlined for years and years, frankly for many, many decades. And it was only when they came into the World Trade Organization that they became a rocket ship because they took advantage of all those. I’m not even blaming them. I’m saying, how stupid were the people that stood here and allowed it to happen? But we don’t allow that to happen. And if they don’t treat us fairly, we’ll leave. But now we’re starting to win cases."
2020-04-10,01:12:29,Donald Trump,How about somebody new for a change? Come on. Go ahead.
2020-04-10,01:12:32,Unnamed,"As many schools and school districts are closing across the country, Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis has not ruled out opening up schools in May, saying that many kids are not vulnerable to this disease. Do you agree with that assessment and would you recommend that schools open up to those states that have-"
2020-04-10,01:12:56,Donald Trump,"Well, I have a lot of confidence in Ron DeSantis, a lot of faith in Ron DeSantis to make the right decision. He’s doing a great job as governor. Ron DeSantis, I had read where he’s thinking about opening up the schools earlier than the date, the end of the month. I’d have to look at the numbers, but again, I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done. If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it. But I’d rather have them, you can call it Federalists, you can call it the constitution, but I call it the constitution. I would rather have them make their decisions. But he’s made a lot of good decisions and he hasn’t said he’s going to, but he’s thinking about it, so I’ll take a look at it."
2020-04-10,01:13:44,Unnamed,"I was wondering if I can ask a follow-up to one of the doctors. If you allow children back in the schools, wouldn’t that pose a threat to spreading the virus even further to some of those vulnerable people?"
2020-04-10,01:13:55,Donald Trump,"I think the answer is obvious, but if you want, either, would you want to just talk about that, maybe? Tony? I think I know the answer to that."
2020-04-10,01:14:07,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I mean, from fewer public health issues is that if you have a situation in which you don’t have a real good control over an outbreak and you allow children to gather together, they likely will get infected. And if they get infected, the likelihood that they will bring the infection home, so that really is a risk. I don’t know the situation at all in any detail, and I’m not specifically speaking about Florida, I’m just speaking generically about what happens when you have infections in the community and you have a congregation of people, such as in classrooms that that’s a risk."
2020-04-10,01:14:37,Jim (Reporter),"Has anyone under 25 died, Dr. Fauci, in the country?"
2020-04-10,01:14:41,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Yes.
2020-04-10,01:14:43,Jim (Reporter),The governor said that no one under 25 has died. I guess you could clarify that people under 25 can die as a result of this.
2020-04-10,01:14:50,Dr. Anthony Fauci,I’m not sure. Again-
2020-04-10,01:14:52,Jim (Reporter),… in the country.
2020-04-10,01:14:53,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Okay, let’s do that because I don’t want to have to be answering for a particular state. Yes. People under 25 have died of coronavirus disease in the United States of America."
2020-04-10,01:15:05,Jim (Reporter),"If you reopen the country in May and there was a new outbreak, or a spike in infections, are you open to the idea of shutting the country down again?"
2020-04-10,01:15:17,Donald Trump,"Depending on the outbreak, yeah. And that’s happened as you know, with a couple of countries. You know what I’m doing? I’m watching the other countries, in many cases, they’re ahead of us from the standpoint that it attacked them before us. It hit them first. And I’m watching what’s happening with respect to certain other countries. Some of them obvious, some of them less obvious and what they’re doing and the success of having. And that’s going to play a large part of the role."
2020-04-10,01:15:44,Donald Trump,"We’re also setting up a council of very, very great doctors and business people. We’re going to be announcing it on Tuesday. Some great people."
2020-04-10,01:15:57,Jim (Reporter),As a second task force?
2020-04-10,01:15:59,Donald Trump,"This is beyond economic. This is really, I call it the Opening our Country Taskforce, or Opening our Country Council, so we don’t get it confused with Mike’s task force, which has done so great. And we’re going to have the great business leaders, great doctors. We’re going to have a great group of people. We’ll probably do it by teleconference because we don’t really want them traveling in for their own purposes. I don’t think it would look good also, but we don’t want them traveling in, so we’ll do teleconference. We did one the other day with the banks and it was very successful, the teleconference itself. And we’ll be announcing names on Tuesday, who’s on that, and that’ll play a role. But ultimately, I have to make that decision and then I’ll have to make a decision, do we close a little area that’s a hotspot?"
2020-04-10,01:16:43,Donald Trump,"I do say this, Jim, I want to get it open as soon as possible. This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great. Not where people are staying in-"
2020-04-10,01:16:53,Jim (Reporter),[inaudible 01:16:55].
2020-04-10,01:16:55,Donald Trump,"I would love to open it. I’m not determined to anything. The facts are going to determine what I do, but we do want to get the country opened. It’s so important. So I have a task force, I’ll have a council. It’s going to be announced on a Tuesday with the names that you have a lot of respect for, a lot of great names, different businesses, different people. Top-"
2020-04-10,01:17:17,Jim (Reporter),Bipartisan?
2020-04-10,01:17:18,Donald Trump,"Bipartisan. I didn’t even ask. I mean honestly, I think it’s bipartisan. The one thing I didn’t ask, are you Republican or a Democrat? Hard to believe, but I didn’t ask. So it would be, and I want their views on what they think. Also very important, different parts of the country. Because you go to the Midwest, it’s different than perhaps the East Coast or the West Coast. Now, the West Coast, those numbers are really pretty amazing on the West Coast. Very interesting. So we’re going to be announcing that in a very short while, probably Tuesday. Go ahead, you."
2020-04-10,01:17:48,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Government officials in Latin American and Caribbean nations, Bahamas, Cayman Islands have been saying that US authorities are blocking the shipment of PPE in certain cases. And I’m wondering if you could speak to that, as well as-"
2020-04-10,01:18:04,Donald Trump,"Well, what we’re doing, we have a tremendous force out there, Naval force, and we’re blocking the shipment of drugs. So maybe what they’re doing is stopping ships that they want to look. We’re not blocking. What we’re doing is we’re making sure… We don’t want drugs in our country, and especially with the over 160 miles of wall, it’s getting very hard to get through the border. They used to drive right through the border like they owned it, and in a certain way, they did. They could drive, right? They had human trafficking. All of a sudden they have a powerful wall up and they’re not driving through that wall. That wall is tough and it’s also loaded up with equipment, cameras and sensors and everything you can think of. On top of that, we have drones flying back and forth over it, so it’s a very powerful barrier between Mexico and the United States."
2020-04-10,01:18:55,Donald Trump,"A lot of people though, what they’re doing now is they’re trying to come in through the waterways, whether it’s the Gulf or the ocean itself. And what we’re doing is we’re being very tough and we’re being tough because of drugs and also human trafficking. And remember, the human trafficking is mostly females. It’s mostly females. It’s horrible and what we’re seeing is horrible. We have a human trafficking problem worldwide, the likes of which, you think of it as an ancient thing. It’s not ancient. It’s bigger now than it’s ever been before, over the last 10 years, because of the internet. The internet made human trafficking to the extent that it is now, which is massive. The internet made it so big. We have a big Naval force that’s stopping, so maybe when you mentioned that, maybe their ships are getting caught. But we are stopping a lot of ships and we’re finding a lot of drugs. Yeah, please."

2020-04-10,01:19:57,Donald Trump,"I meant you, but that’s okay. Go ahead, we’ll do this."
2020-04-10,01:19:59,Unnamed,Sorry.
2020-04-10,01:19:59,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-10,01:20:00,Unnamed,"On the additional money for small business apparently, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, speaking with the Democrats in Congress, are you allowing-"
2020-04-10,01:20:07,Donald Trump,Are you talking about the new-
2020-04-10,01:20:09,Unnamed,"Yeah, on the new $250 billion-"
2020-04-10,01:20:10,Donald Trump,"Yeah, 250."
2020-04-10,01:20:11,Unnamed,"Are you willing to give in to the democratic demands for additional money for hospitals, states and cities in that interim round of-"
2020-04-10,01:20:17,Donald Trump,"I’d rather have that be in phase four. I don’t deny it. I think it’s fine, but I think it should be in phase four and I think we should have infrastructure. And I think we should have a payroll tax moratorium because that’s something that over a period of time the workers get sort of semi-immediately. It’s over that period of time. It starts immediately, but it’s over a period of time. I mean, there are a lot of people, I’m one of them, that would have liked to have seen the payroll tax cut as a permanent cut. But we should do the double-edged, meaning business-employee payroll tax cut. So we’re talking about that and I’m certainly okay with helping the States and helping the hospitals. I just think, because look, the hospitals need help. You see what they’ve gone through and the States need help. Some states in particular need help. They need big help."
2020-04-10,01:21:08,Donald Trump,"I’m willing to look at that very strongly, but I like looking at it in phase four. The 251 is actually, the plan is working out well, the banks are getting started with the distribution. They’ve taken thousands and thousands of applications. The numbers aren’t even believable, the number of applications. They’re swamped, with Bank of America and Wells Fargo and I guess Citi Bank is just now kicking in. And also what nobody’s talking about, the commercial banks, the community banks, everyone’s talking commercial banks. The community banks are doing tremendous volumes and they’re probably doing them faster, from what I understand. I hear the community banks frankly are the easiest ones in terms of getting the money out. So the money is getting out. The applications are far beyond what we ever anticipated and that’s why we’re going… Because this is money that goes essentially, to the workers. We want the businesses to hold onto their workers because once they lose the workers, they’re never opening again. It’s not going to happen. Okay. In the back."
2020-04-10,01:22:10,Gordon Lubold,"Yes, sir. Gordon Lubold from The Wall Street Journal. I wondered if you could expand a little bit on the form that Mexico would take the reimbursements. What form would that take? You essentially add it to the tab for the wall that you mentioned. And I have a second question about that."
2020-04-10,01:22:26,Donald Trump,"Well, there’s no real cost because we’re agreeing to produce a little bit less. So number one, it’s staying in the ground, you have it, you have it for another day. It’s actually cheaper than storing it where you take it out and you deliver it to a massive well, like the strategic reserves, our national strategic reserves, where it has to be brought there. That’s an expensive process in itself. But oil is getting to a point where, I mean, there are some areas, some people would say the water is more valuable than the oil. You never thought you’re going to see that. You never thought, having covered, I know you cover it, you never thought you’d be seeing oil at $20 a barrel, but how about $ 10 a barrel? That, you’d never thought you’d see. So we are looking at it very strongly. There is no real cost."
2020-04-10,01:23:06,Donald Trump,"I want to help Mexico out. We have a great relationship with Mexico, great relationship with the president. I really like him a lot. He’s been terrific to us in the border because he stopped. You don’t see the caravans coming up anymore. You don’t see all the problems. When I took office, it was unbelievable what was going on. And they have been helping us a lot and we’ve been helping them a lot. They make product for us, they sell it to us and it’s fine. It’s a good relationship. Sometimes it’s a great relationship."
2020-04-10,01:23:38,Donald Trump,"He could not have done any more than that. And I think there was political reasons for that for him, that other nations don’t have. They don’t have that. The nations that we’re talking about, the 22 other nations that we’re talking about, they just don’t have that problem. So it doesn’t cost us anything and yet, it’s very valuable. We will be reimbursed in the future, maybe in the near future, maybe in the more distant future, but we’ll be reimbursed by Mexico in a certain way and it’ll be fine. But we get Mexico over the hump."
2020-04-10,01:24:10,Donald Trump,"Now, with all of that being said, that doesn’t mean the deal is going to happen anyway because they still have a lot of different stakes. But this was one of the stumbling blocks. Okay, go ahead."
2020-04-10,01:24:19,Gordon Lubold,"If I may. China and some other countries have been particularly active, seen as maybe taking advantage of the US during this period. China, particularly active in the South China Sea. You got a carrier down, obviously. What’s your message to some of these adversaries and competitors?"
2020-04-10,01:24:37,Donald Trump,"Well, look, the way I view it is this. China has taken advantage of the United States for 30 years. I mentioned the World Trade Organization. China has taken advantage of us through that and using rules that are unfair to the United States and they should have never been allowed. This should’ve never been allowed to happen. When China joined and was allowed to join under those circumstances, the World Trade Organization, that was a very bad day for the United States because they had rules and regulations that were far different and far easier than our rules and regulations. Plus, they took advantage of them down to the last, and you know China and you study China, and you know what I mean. They took advantage of them like very few people would even think to take advantage of them."
2020-04-10,01:25:28,Donald Trump,"Again, they are considered a developing nation. We are not considered a developing nation. They’re given advantages. Okay. For many years, China has ripped off the United States, and then I came along. And right now as you know, China is paying 25% and we’ve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China. And I know a lot of the people kept saying, “Oh no, we’re paying.” Well, we’re not paying. Countries are different, not every country is China. But China would devalue their currency and then also pour out money. And they essentially were paying most of those tariffs, not us. And as you know, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars. They targeted our farmers, but we took in so much money that I was able to give back, one year it was 12 billion, one year it was 16 billion. I was able to give back our farmers the money that they were targeted, hurt,"
2020-04-10,01:26:21,Donald Trump,"China bought $12 billion and bought $16 billion, one year 12 one year 16. I was able to give them back the 12 and then give them back the 16, the farmers and they weren’t targeted and they’re all in business. Now, we’re doing it because they got targeted in a different way. Now, I’m going to be very interested to see. So we signed a deal with China and under that deal, they’re supposed to buy substantially in excess of $200 billion from us. That’s not only foreign product, it’s manufacturing product, it’s lots of different things. They’re going to buy a lot. I just want to see if they live up to that deal. I know President Xi. I would say he would live up to the deal. But remember this, I never took off the tariff. It’s still 25%, 25% of $250 billion. So for the first time and you saw also…"
2020-04-10,01:27:10,Donald Trump,"Now again, I’m going before the virus, because that’s sort of like, “Let’s start all over again.” I can’t tell you that yet because that chapter hasn’t been written yet. But go up a few weeks ago, the deficit with the United States and China was coming way down. Nobody’s ever seen that before. But the deficit has come way down. So now, we start a new chapter. And I can only tell you if a smart person is standing where I’m standing, we’re going to do very well with China. I have to also say this, I think our relationship and having the relationship I have with China is a good thing. But for the first time, we’re benefiting instead of being the sucker that got taken advantage, for years. I said to China, “How did this ever happen?” I got to know them very well. I said to them, representatives of China, at the top level… You know who I’m talking about. I say, “How did this ever happen?” They looked at me and they said, “But nobody ever called us.”"
2020-04-10,01:28:19,Donald Trump,"We didn’t have a deal. It’s not like we had a bad deal. We had worse, we didn’t have any deal at all. So they just took advantage. Think of it, $500 billion a year deficit. $500 million is a lot of money, right? Everyone thinks I’ve made a mistake when I say $500 trillion. No, you mean $500 million. No. I said $500 billion a year deficit with China, for a long time. But it 200, it was 300, it was 400, it was 500, $556 billion, $507. $500 billion plus a year deficit with China. Now, I’m charging them tariffs. It’s very interesting, a lot of people that don’t want to do that, they all agreed. Because China has taken advantage of this country like nobody has ever taken. We have built China with the money we gave them. Now, I give them a lot of credit. I give them a lot of credit. They did it, but you know what? We made it a hell of a lot easier. We gave them a fortune."
2020-04-10,01:29:24,Donald Trump,"Go ahead. How about you, in the back? Yes."
2020-04-10,01:29:26,Deborah Saunders,"Well, thank you. Mr. President. I’m Deborah Saunders of the Las Vegas Review Journal and I’m here today as a print reporter, a print pooler. So I’d like to ask you a question and then ask a question from one of the reporters who couldn’t be here because of social distancing."
2020-04-10,01:29:40,Donald Trump,"Sure, go ahead."
2020-04-10,01:29:40,Deborah Saunders,Thank you.
2020-04-10,01:29:40,Donald Trump,"A little louder, please."
2020-04-10,01:29:42,Deborah Saunders,"Thank you. I was wondering if you have been tested for antibodies, if you’ve taken the antibody test?"
2020-04-10,01:29:48,Donald Trump,Have I been tested?
2020-04-10,01:29:49,Deborah Saunders,Yes.
2020-04-10,01:29:50,Donald Trump,Not that I know of. I’ve had some tests.
2020-04-10,01:29:51,Deborah Saunders,Has anybody else been tested?
2020-04-10,01:29:54,Donald Trump,No. They tell me no. I’ll accept that.
2020-04-10,01:29:54,Deborah Saunders,Has anybody else on the task force been tested for antibodies?
2020-04-10,01:29:57,Unnamed,We don’t have a test. We don’t have the test.
2020-04-10,01:29:59,Donald Trump,That’ll come out. They’ve just developed those tests. It’s sort of new.
2020-04-10,01:30:03,Deborah Saunders,"Okay, good to know. So this question is from Andrew Feinberg with Newsweek. A significant amount of federal aid was made available to Boeing in the recently signed Cares Act relief package. But according to sources, Boeing executives are still planning a round the layoffs. Should Boeing or any company that accepts federal aid, to stay in business during this pandemic be penalized for laying off workers after doing so?"
2020-04-10,01:30:27,Donald Trump,"Yeah. Well, the aid hasn’t been given yet, but they will be asking in my opinion. They haven’t even asked yet. Boeing has not asked for aid yet, but I think they probably will. Now, at the same time, they do have to run a company. This isn’t a great time to sell airplanes, let’s not kid ourselves. If you’re a business person, Boeing makes airplanes. They had a big problem with one, but they make the greatest airplanes. They make the best airplanes in the world. They had the problem with one, they got it too complex. It becomes so complex, you have to be number one in your class at MIT to be able to fly it. It’s a mistake. Every two years they want to make it more and more. I mean, they had great success with the 737, the Boeing 737. Then all of a sudden they do the Max and they say, “Let’s make it more complicated. Let’s put on different engines. Let’s do this. Let’s do that.” It was not exactly a good decision. Bad decision, very horrible decision."
2020-04-10,01:31:23,Donald Trump,"Number one, human lives and number two horrible what’s happened to the company. Here’s a company, from a business standpoint, it was probably the greatest company in the world, in my opinion. I think it amounts to 1% of GDP. Some people say it’s a half, I think it’s 1. But here’s one of the greatest companies anywhere in the world, maybe the greatest and boom. Now, on top of what happened there with the two planes, and they say they have that fixed, that’s good. They say they have it fixed, indisputably. In fact, somebody said, they gave me something. I said, “You should say it that way.” They said, “Sir, this is now the safest airplane in the air.” I said, “That’s what you should say. That’s a very good statement. It’s the safest airplane in the air. That’s a very good statement. You should use it.” I said, “By the way, are you changing the name? But whether you do or not, you should use that.” But he said that. A Boeing person said to me, “It’s the safest airplane in the air.” that’s a great thing."
2020-04-10,01:32:23,Donald Trump,"But we know they’re going to need help. Now, does that mean they’re going to need help and they should keep people that they absolutely don’t need? That business is a very cyclical business, like many businesses, frankly. That determination hasn’t been made. They have not spoken to us yet. I think they will be. Maybe they won’t need help. That’ll be great. Look, Boeing made so much money. Who would have thought, they had all of those planes that are parked all over the place, in many cases, I guess, payments not made. But who would’ve thought they could do that and they’re still a solvent company? I mean, what a tragic thing happened in numerous ways, but also economically. So when they see us, making sure that Boeing is strong again is very, very powerful and very important and we’ll do whatever is necessary to do. Please."
2020-04-10,01:33:15,Tony,Thank you. A quick one and then a longer one. First of all-
2020-04-10,01:33:18,Donald Trump,"Should we keep this going, everybody?"
2020-04-10,01:33:20,Unnamed,You’re the President.
2020-04-10,01:33:21,Donald Trump,"Jim wants to leave. No, I’m only kidding. Keep it going for a while, yes? I mean, we have time, if you want. You’re not going to criticize me, that the conference was too long? If I leave short, yesterday I left short, “It was too short.” If I stay too long they say it was too long. Some day we’re going to get it just right. Okay. Should we continue? Should we continue? Yes?"
2020-04-10,01:33:44,Tony,"Well, at least answer my questions, yeah."
2020-04-10,01:33:45,Donald Trump,Okay. At least for your question.
2020-04-10,01:33:46,Tony,Have you had a chance to speak to-
2020-04-10,01:33:47,Donald Trump,It’s not a bad point.
2020-04-10,01:33:50,Tony,Have you had a chance yet to speak to Boris Johnson since it came out-
2020-04-10,01:33:51,Donald Trump,"I have not. No. I have a call just to wish him well, to his group. No, I don’t want to be calling him now. I want him to get better. He’s a great guy. He’s become a friend of mine, real friend of mine. He has a great feeling for our country. Obviously, for his country, he loves it. He’s a tremendous guy."
2020-04-10,01:34:11,Tony,Slightly more complicated one-
2020-04-10,01:34:13,Donald Trump,"I think he’s probably right now… He was very high… I think he might be 100% popularity right now. When they talk about approval polls, right? You ever hear that term? I’m sure you’ve never heard that. I hear it all the time. His approval rating must be about 300%. but he’s a great guy. He was a great guy before and I think people see what he’s been through. What he’s been through is incredible. And they say, a big turn, so let’s see what happens. Let’s hope."
2020-04-10,01:34:40,Tony,"If I may, where do you see the use of something like immunity certificates or documents or passports? When we get to anti-"
2020-04-10,01:34:48,Donald Trump,Something like? Excuse me.
2020-04-10,01:34:49,Tony,"Immunity certificates, once we get antibody testing, whether this will be a useful way-"
2020-04-10,01:34:54,Donald Trump,"Yeah. I see a lot of different things. We’re going to be very careful for who comes into the country. Look, my opposition party wants to have open borders. This is a case where I’m very glad that my position is, I don’t want to open borders. I want very strong borders. That includes not only on this Southern border, our Southern border with Mexico, and you could also say our Northern border with Canada, but we want to have strong borders. And I think this is maybe one of the learning points. We learned something about borders. We need borders. The country needs borders to be a great country and I think this is a great point. Go ahead. You have something else?"
2020-04-10,01:35:36,Tony,"Yeah. I wasn’t just thinking about that for borders. I just thought for ordinary Americans who are currently stuck at home, if they’re tested for antibodies, it turns out they’ve had the disease and therefore, shouldn’t be infected again. Some sort of documentation that would allow them to go back to work safely."
2020-04-10,01:35:50,Donald Trump,You mean once they get better?
2020-04-10,01:35:52,Tony,Yeah-
2020-04-10,01:35:53,Donald Trump,"Okay. So they have the disease and they’re better and they have the immunity now. Supposedly, according to what I’m hearing, it could be for a long period, could be for a lifetime, it could also be for a year or two, I’m hearing Tony. Nobody’s told me yet, if it’s for a year, if it’s for two years or if it’s for a lifetime. Like chickenpox, they say if you have chickenpox, you have immunity, they say for a lifetime. I hope that’s true. But nobody’s actually told me with certainty, maybe because they don’t know yet."
2020-04-10,01:36:22,Unnamed,They don’t know yet.
2020-04-10,01:36:23,Donald Trump,You don’t know yet. Because it’s new. This came upon us. Nobody knew. They do know you have it for a period of time and it’s strong for a period of time. They don’t know. That’s hence the antibodies that we’re making.
2020-04-10,01:36:37,Donald Trump,"I saw somebody who was really sick and he got better, a young person, relatively young person, 35 and physically fit and he got better. He made it barely, but he made it. His first thing that he did when he was better is, “I want to give whatever I can give to help other people because nobody should go through.” It’s a tough thing. So we don’t know yet how long… If you’d like to add anything to that, but we don’t know yet. Is it a year? It will be a year, but is it more than a year? And only time is going to tell. Okay, thank you."
2020-04-10,01:37:10,Tony,One more question.
2020-04-10,01:37:11,Donald Trump,Go ahead. We’ll try one more.
2020-04-10,01:37:13,Unnamed,"Will you have governors, mayors, members of Congress on the Open the Country Council that you talked about?"
2020-04-10,01:37:19,Donald Trump,"Yeah. I think so. I think we’re going to put some governors. I’ve gained great respect for governors, both Republican and Democrat. I’ve actually become friends with some of the Democrat governors that I wouldn’t have really had the privilege of getting to know. And Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a very liberal guy. I’m not. But we’ve had a great relationship. John Bell, as you know, I call him John Bell, but John Bell Edwards, people call him John Bell, sort of a cool name, from Louisiana. I have a very good relationship with him."
2020-04-10,01:37:54,Donald Trump,"Gavin Newsom, honestly, I think… Hey, we’re fighting right now. I want automobiles to be made cheaper and safer and stronger. But you save three, $4,000 per… and environmentally equal, or better maybe. And we’re fighting on that. We’re fighting a lot of different things. We fight on the border. He wants open borders. I want people to come into our country illegally. But I’ve gotten very friendly with Gavin Newsome. He’s done a very good job here."
2020-04-10,01:38:28,Donald Trump,"I think I’ve gotten very friendly, I mean, he’s been sort of a friend of mine for a long time, don’t get to see him much, but Governor Cuomo of New York. We talk all the time. I told you I spoke to him literally, the last call just before walking in here. I’ve really developed a lot of good friendships with the governors. And including the governors, I think Mike DeWine, Republican, but I think he’s done a great job in Ohio. So yeah, I want to put on both parties. I want to have some governors. Am I going to have all of the governors? But I’d like to put some representative governors on the council. Yes, I would like to do that."
2020-04-10,01:39:06,Unnamed,Any to serve?
2020-04-10,01:39:06,Donald Trump,"I have, I’ve asked a couple of them. They’ve all said yes. So far, everyone said yes. I think everybody would like to be on that council. That’s a very important council. Go ahead in the back, you haven’t gone yet."
2020-04-10,01:39:18,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions, if I may. Do you have a message to those pastors who are still planning to have Easter services, defying the public health guidelines?"
2020-04-10,01:39:28,Donald Trump,You’re going to have to say it louder. To those what?
2020-04-10,01:39:30,Unnamed,"To those pastors who are still planning to have Easter services, in-person."
2020-04-10,01:39:37,Unnamed,Pastors.
2020-04-10,01:39:37,Donald Trump,"Oh, the pastors. I didn’t understand your word. You have a very nice voice but it’s a little bit low and you’re far back. I’ve had talks with the pastors and most of the pastures agree. This is a very complex subject. Let’s face it, for the obvious reasons I don’t have to go into it. Most of the pastors agree that they are better off doing what they’re doing, which is distancing. They feel that, let’s get this over with and they want to get back to church so badly. I mean, can you imagine we have Easter Sunday and I’m going to be watching Pastor Robert Jeffress, who’s been a great guy. Did I tell you? He’s been a great guy and I’m going to be watching on a laptop."
2020-04-10,01:40:20,Donald Trump,"Now, a laptop is not the same as being in his church or being in another church. It’s not and no matter what you say, you don’t get to say, “Oh, isn’t wonderful.” But I’ve done this for three weeks and they’ve had tremendous… I let people know who it is. They’ve had the biggest audiences they’ve ever had. They have millions of people now watching and people are really liking what they’re hearing. I’m going to be with, on Easter, Pastor… I don’t even know if he knows it yet, but he will soon. I think he will in about two minutes. Pastor Robert Jeffress and he’s a terrific guy, a terrific man. I’ve gotten to know him very well. He’s a man of great compassion. He loves our country and I’m going to be with him on Easter, meaning, I’m going to be with him watching on a laptop. Doesn’t sound good, but it’s one of those things."
2020-04-10,01:41:08,Donald Trump,"It can not be church, and I’m not going to get into it. It cannot be church. Most pastors and most people of faith, people that we’ll listen to and respect and admire. Franklin Graham is a person I have great respect for and who’s done an incredible job in New York on Central Park where they put up Samaritan’s Purse. He’s done an incredible job. The son of the late great Billy Graham. His family is incredible. He’s incredible. Franklin Graham, the job he’s doing, I mean, he loves to do it. He has such a passion and that’s why he’s so good at it. He does it with incredible love. And he will tell you, we’re all saying, we’ve got to get our country cured. I know there are some pastors and ministers and others that want to get together and I have great respect for them. Two of them I know, but I would say for…"
2020-04-10,01:42:03,Donald Trump,"And I have great respect for him. Two of them I know, but I would say first heal … I’m a Christian, heal our country. Let’s get healed before we do this and there’s time to do that. We’ll do it for hopefully the rest of our lives. Please."
2020-04-10,01:42:17,Unnamed,Thank you. The Mercy and the Comfort seem to be underutilized in Los Angeles and New York.
2020-04-10,01:42:23,Donald Trump,Yeah. Yeah.
2020-04-10,01:42:24,Unnamed,Is there any consideration either to sending the medical units into the cities to help the hospitals there or to moving the hospital ships?
2020-04-10,01:42:33,Donald Trump,"So the Mercy and the Comfort were sent when projections were much higher. And I say, Tony backed it up. Debra’s made the statement, they said, “You’re not going to need these many rooms.” But we wanted to be prepared. I mean, we had the ship, they did an incredible job with … The Comfort was supposed to be in maintenance for a period of four weeks and they had it done in three and a half, four days and it came up. And so we had it there. If there was a disaster from the standpoint of you needed all of the … I tell you, the Javits Center, Andrew will tell you we were ready to go. It’s incredible the job they did, but they’re using less beds. This is a good thing, not a bad thing. They’re using less beds."
2020-04-10,01:43:20,Donald Trump,"Now, Javits has been pretty busy over the last couple of days and the death numbers are horrific, but you go back now and you’re finding they’re going to start to come down very substantially just based on the fact that the bed usage, the number of beds are much, much less, much, much less. So the Mercy and the Comfort were there in case they needed them. Los Angeles, where you have the one, and New York where you have the other, they just don’t … Fortunately, we haven’t hit numbers where they would have needed, they would have been used. There are always going to be sort of overflow because they’re on the edges, they’re not as convenient as certain places, but the people were ready, willing, and able. They were ready to go. They were going to do a great job. But fortunately we don’t need, just like we didn’t need as many ventilators, when they were asking in New York for 40,000 ventilators. I had experts, these people, I listened to them, they said, “You’ll never need that many.” And they were right."
2020-04-10,01:44:21,Donald Trump,"New York now has … And I dealt really well with Mayor de Blasio. We got him a lot of ventilators. We got Andrew a lot of ventilators, but we never felt you needed the numbers that you were talking about and we were right on that. Now, with all of that being said, we have a lot of ventilators ready to go. We have almost 10,000 in the stockpile. That 10,000 can move rapidly. We can be within 24 hours almost anywhere, and hopefully we’re not going to have to be, but it’s just … It’s really … This has been a great military operation. It hasn’t all been military, because we’re dealing with great companies. We’re have companies that are making masks and we’re all set up in the masks too."
2020-04-10,01:45:01,Donald Trump,"I just told you, we have an order coming in soon. 500 million masks, 500 million. We have companies, you know the story with GM or 3M, also GM, but 3M is doing a great job. I spoke to the CEO the other day. We settled it out. We had a dispute with them and it’s now all settled and I think they’re trying to show the country something. Maybe me, but the country something. So we’ve done … And not me. I’m not talking about me. This country, our country, the people that are doing it, Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, these people sitting right here, people that we have in the back that are watching every word that we’re saying, they’ve done a fantastic job. They really have done a fantastic job. Please."
2020-04-10,01:45:53,Doug,"Thank you, mister president. I wanted to ask you a question about testing. You’ve mentioned the impossibility of testing the entire American public, so has-"
2020-04-10,01:46:01,Donald Trump,Well what do we have?
2020-04-10,01:46:02,Doug,The surgeon general-
2020-04-10,01:46:03,Donald Trump,Hold on. What do we have? 350 million people? You want to do 300-
2020-04-10,01:46:06,Doug,"That’s not what I’m getting at and what I’m getting at is priorities. And Dr. Birx has mentioned how there have been priorities in certain regional parts of the country, and I wanted to ask you specifically about one industry in particular, and that’s food processing plants. Is there a priority to get testing at food processing plants all across the country?"
2020-04-10,01:46:26,Donald Trump,"You’re asking that because of what happened? It’s a fair question too, what happened in Denver. Because in Denver I’ve never seen, I said, “What’s going on?” We’re looking at this graph where everything’s looking beautiful and it’s coming down and then you’ve got this one spike. I said, “What happened to Denver?” And many people very quickly, and by the way, they were on it like so fast. You wouldn’t believe it. They knew every aspect. They have people going, not only testing, who did you see? Where were you? How many people did you meet? Were you out to dinner in somebody else’s home? Where were you? Where did this number of people come from? How did … They are totally on it now this just happened. I just saw it this morning. I’m looking at everything smooth going down, topping out. Then you have this one spike in Denver. It’s like, “Where did this come from?”"
2020-04-10,01:47:18,Donald Trump,"So we’ll be looking at that and we don’t want cases like that happening. This was … But this is the kind of thing can happen. This is very complex. It’s a very brilliant enemy. It’s a brilliant enemy. They develop drugs like the antibiotics, you see it. Antibiotics used to solve every problem. Now, one of the biggest problems the world has is the germ has gotten so brilliant that the antibiotic can’t keep up with it. And they’re constantly trying to come up with a new … People go to a hospital and they catch … They go for a heart operation, that’s no problem. But they end up dying from problems. You know the problems I’m talking about. There’s a whole genius to it. We’re fighting … Not only is it hidden, but it’s very smart. Okay? It’s invisible and it’s hidden. But it’s very smart. And you see that in a case like a Denver. But I think we’re doing well and they’re on Denver like you wouldn’t believe. I came in this morning, it was a flurry. I said, “What’s going on?” They said, “Denver.” I said, “What happened in Denver?” Because Denver was doing pretty well and they’ve got that under control. But yeah, that would be a case where you do some very big testing. Peter?"
2020-04-10,01:48:32,Peter (Reporter),"Mister president, we learned that more than 16 million Americans filed for unemployment over the past three weeks. It’s good Friday, it’s payday. We are seeing troubling, paralyzing lines at food banks around the country. What do you say to those Americans in need right this moment?"
2020-04-10,01:48:47,Donald Trump,"Number one, I love them. Number two, we’re working really hard. It wasn’t their fault what happened. Sometimes they don’t do a good job and they lose their job. That’s one thing. This is a case where we take the strongest economy in the history of the world, which is what we had. More people working in the United States, Peter, than ever before. Almost, I mean, look at the numbers. 160 million people, almost just short of 160. Excuse me. So we have the greatest economy we’ve ever had, and by the way, black unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, Asian unemployment, the best numbers we’ve ever had in virtually every way. And then you get hit like this and it’s dramatic. People that had great jobs that went out to dinner and they didn’t have any problems, they take their family, they were making good salaries. All of a sudden, you use the term cold turkey, it’s cold turkey. They go from that to having no money and waiting for their checks, which are being processed very rapidly, but they still … They have to go out and look for money. It’s a terrible thing. All I say is we love them, we’re working so hard, and they’re going to be back, and I hope they’re going to be back even stronger than before."
2020-04-10,01:50:01,Peter (Reporter),"Let me ask you about that, if I can, just to follow up then. You chose not to do a national stay at home order. Now that you say you want to reopen parts of the economy, what authority do you have to do that? Is it ultimately up to the states to do that?"
2020-04-10,01:50:13,Donald Trump,"Yeah, no, it’s really … The states can do things if they want. I can override it if I want, but the national stay at home, just so you understand, 95% of the country is stay at home. Like as an example, I was speaking with the great governor of Texas, Greg Abbott the other day. He has a stay at home. A lot of people didn’t even know it, but he had to stay at home. Some people reported Texas wasn’t. He had a very strong, actually a very strong state at home, 95 to 96%. South Carolina, as you know, has it, which at one point, we could go, they didn’t have South Carolina, another great governor, McMaster. No, 95% of the country is covered. Now, the states that aren’t, and again, constitutionally from a Federalist standpoint, if I thought there was a problem, if I saw a state with a problem, I would absolutely demand it. But they’re doing great. And the states that aren’t, are states that have not had a big problem."
2020-04-10,01:51:14,Peter (Reporter),"What authority do you have to reopen right now? The same way that’s up to the states to shut it down, it’s up to them to reopen."
2020-04-10,01:51:19,Donald Trump,"I have great authority if I want to use it, I would rather have the states use it. I would rather … And this is so shocking for me, a lot of people are saying, “Wow, he’s really very [inaudible 01:51:27].” A lot of people are shocked. They think I’d do it. I have absolute authority to use it, but so far our relationship with governors and the job they’re doing, I haven’t had to do it. Would I do it? If I saw a state that was out of control and they didn’t have the stay at home policy, I would do it in a heartbeat. Jeff?"
2020-04-10,01:51:45,Unnamed,"Mister president, there’s obviously a lot of interest in how you’re going to make that decision. What-"
2020-04-10,01:51:51,Donald Trump,It’s a very big decision.
2020-04-10,01:51:52,Unnamed,What-
2020-04-10,01:51:52,Donald Trump,"I don’t know that I’ve had a bigger decision than that, when you think, right, I mean, think of that decision. Somebody said it’s totally up to the president, I saw it this morning, it’s totally up, and it is. I don’t know that I’ve had a bigger decision, but I’m going to surround myself with the greatest minds. Not only the greatest minds but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason, and we’re going to make a decision and hopefully it’s going to be the right decision. I will say this, I want to get it open as soon as we can. We have to get our country open, Jeff."
2020-04-10,01:52:26,Unnamed,"Can you say sir, what metrics you will use to make that that decision?"
2020-04-10,01:52:28,Donald Trump,"The metrics right here. That’s my metrics. That’s all I can do. I can listen to 35 people. At the end, I’ve got to make a decision and I didn’t think of it until yesterday. I said, “This is a big decision.” But I want to be guided. I’m going to be guided by them. I’m going to be guided by our vice president. I’m going to make a decision based on a lot of different opinions. Some will maybe disagree, and some I’d love to see it where they don’t disagree. Will there be risks? It’s always going to be a risk that something can flare up. There’s always going to … Look, look at what’s happening where countries are trying to get open and there’s a flare up and they’ll go, but I’d like the flare up to be very localized so that we can control it from a local standpoint without having to close. There’s always a risk."
2020-04-10,01:53:17,Donald Trump,"This is genius that we’re fighting, we’re fighting this hidden enemy, which is genius. Okay? It’s genius. The way it’s attacked so many countries at so many different angles. I mean, you take a look at what’s going on and the greatest doctors in the world, I think they’re close, by the way, but they haven’t figured it out yet. Look what it’s done to some people. I mean, some people it’s grabbed and it’s a horrible way to go. You want to know the truth. It’s a horrible … And then other people that hardly has an impact. We talked about it, it’s sniffles, it’s less. They don’t even know they had anything. And some people … I looked at New York this morning and I look at what’s happening in the amount of people that are dying. And dying, violently dying. It’s a very tough adversary, but we’re going to win and we’re going to win it very decisively. I’m going to have to make a decision, and I only hope to God that it’s the right decision. But I would say without question, it’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make."
2020-04-10,01:54:28,Unnamed,"A quick follow up to the doctors if I may, for Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, the models as I understand them, are based on social distancing, continuing through May. Is that correct? And if you were to open the economy on May 1st or sometime during that month, would that impact the models in terms of the deaths that you expect?"
2020-04-10,01:54:52,Donald Trump,Want to answer that?
2020-04-10,01:54:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We’re taking turns today. Good, it’s good. So the model, the IHME model does state that it’s through May. Every … We’ve had these model discussions, haven’t we? For weeks now. So the models are informed by the data and you can see how much that model has shifted on the amazing work of the American people. So I think that’s what we’re evaluating right now. Remember, when I talked yesterday, I’ve been in public health a long time. I have never … Except for Ebola where we worked very closely with the communities about specific issues. We’ve never taken a country wide or a global wide approach to mitigation. This is unprecedented. I will tell you there is nothing in the literature about specifically what to expect, and I think that’s why the models continue to modify themselves based on what actually has happened with social distancing and hand-washing and all of the pieces that the American people are doing."
2020-04-10,01:56:00,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The decreasing, the closing of the bars, the closing of the restaurants, no communal eating. That was thought to be a very big issue in many of the other cultures that went through this virus. The models continue to evolve based on the impact and so therefore it makes it very difficult to interpret each component of social distancing, and which ones are absolutely critical. Now there’s a way to do that in multivariate analysis potentially, and I want everyone to understand there are states that are testing, there are states that are doing contact tracing. So I mean, I think sometimes we get … We look at what New York is doing and Detroit, we forget that there’s a Utah and New Mexico and a North and South Dakota and a whole series of states that have been doing testing and contact tracing and have been testing at rates higher than that per capita rate that we all have discussed."
2020-04-10,01:56:53,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So we’re looking at that. What did they do? Where are the most vulnerabilities? Where are the outbreaks most likely to occur? That’s why I’ve been talking about nursing homes, because we do believe that there’s a relationship between age and seriousness of disease. Not to say that there can’t be young people with serious disease, but proportionally it’s a smaller piece with serious disease. So when you have that kind of spectrum where the older and the more complicated, the higher the severity, you have the impression that there may be more asymptomatic in younger age groups. And that’s where the antibody test comes in."
2020-04-10,01:57:31,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So when you put all these pieces together, you’re trying to understand where would be the first signals, so we have surveillance out there right now with the CDC’s influenza like illness. I hope you’re all tracking that. It is showing these small changes. I think we can believe in that as a surveillance tool married with their syndromic piece, giving us the insight about where to test and then where to proactively test, in nursing homes and other vulnerable groups, because that has been the signal in a series of the states that have very, very low prevalence and incidence of disease."
2020-04-10,01:58:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So that’s the kind of factors we’re putting all together to really define the best way forward. And we have superb roadmaps. I hope you all have seen them. There’s been about six different roadmaps to opening that people have put online and, again, there’s no literature that you can cite and say, “Well, we did this 20 years ago and what really worked.” There’s isn’t that, there’s brilliant public health people giving us their insights."
2020-04-10,01:58:35,Unnamed,"I guess more of the question is because those are the models you’ve been using. If you do go with opening up … Starting to open up the economy again on May 1st, doesn’t that lead to more deaths?"
2020-04-10,01:58:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, look at how much it changed with mitigation and now we’re looking at those state by state, and there’s some states in there that are still in contact tracing. So we’re looking at the impact of that model, what that model predicted based on the type of contact tracing, less mitigation, more contact raising. Are you getting what I’m talking about? Okay. So there are states that didn’t stay at home orders, but we’re doing contract tracing from outbreak. So we’re looking at them and how they have done and we’re looking at certainly what’s happened in the big metro areas and we’re integrating all of that data together to make a plan going forward."
2020-04-10,01:59:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I can’t tell you … Because look at how much the model has changed in just a week. Remember just a week ago, it was 80,000 now it’s 60,000, and the curves, I’m sure you’re all watching it, the curves are getting much broader confidence intervals. There is still the dotted line, but the confidence intervals around the dotted line are getting bigger. When you see that, you know the model has a bit of an instability. And so that’s why Tony and I base a lot of our decision and discussion on cases and what physically is happening in that county and that state at the same time, not ignoring the models, but integrating the models as one piece of our thought process. Do you want to come up here and say what you think about models? Okay."
2020-04-10,02:00:16,Donald Trump,"I just want to say that you’ve talked about couldn’t it lead to death, meaning you open up could lead to death and you’re right, but you know what? Staying at home leads to death also. And it’s very traumatic for this country, but staying at home, if you look at numbers, that leads to a different kind of death perhaps, but it leads to death also. So it’s a very big decision. As I say, it’s the biggest decision I’ll ever make. All right. We’ll do a couple of more and we’ll go. Thank you."
2020-04-10,02:00:47,Kristen,"Thank you, mister president, before you came out here, you said one of the last people that you talked to was Governor Cuomo."
2020-04-10,02:00:53,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-04-10,02:00:54,Kristen,"And at his news conference today, he said that he was asking you to use the Defense Production Act to require companies to make more tests to streamline testing. Is that something that you would consider? Because you’ve considered it with ventilators-"
2020-04-10,02:01:10,Donald Trump,"The other side seems to keep using that, and I have used it. I’ve enacted it, and I’ve used it, some people thought viciously, just ask a couple of companies if you want, you can just look up the names. And I’m surprised that he would’ve said that. We actually have great tests. We have others under development. You don’t need full testing, as the doctors have been talking about ad nauseum. So I would be surprised that he would’ve said that meaning it that way. If he did, I’d have a much different type answer. Go ahead."
2020-04-10,02:01:43,Unnamed,[inaudible 02:01:43] didn’t talk about it on the phone.
2020-04-10,02:01:44,Donald Trump,"We talked about testing. Yeah, we did talk about testing and one of the things I did was I put the two doctors in charge of that call. I said, “You know what Andrew? I have two very talented people standing here. We’re getting ready to go on. Let me put them and let me have them talk to you.” And they talked to him really at length and I think by the time they finished he understood what he was, what we were saying. He understood it very clearly."
2020-04-10,02:02:09,Kristen,One more question please. You’ve talked a lot this week about holding the World Health Organization responsible for its response to the coronavirus. I’m curious if you’ve given any more thought to holding China financially responsible for the part that it played and the economic toll that it’s taking on the American people.
2020-04-10,02:02:31,Donald Trump,"I understand the question very well. Nobody has done to China or treated China as strongly as I have, used the word strongly. As you know, you’ve reported on it. Billions and billions of is flowing into our treasury because of what I’ve done with China. I think it’s a very sad thing that happened, and I think if people knew, including the World Health Organization, and I do believe they knew, but they didn’t want to tell the world, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it, and we’ll have reports on all of this and we are … We’re not happy about it, but I wanted to leave the world health war later and I can tell you that we’re constantly in touch with China. We’re talking to China, and we’ve expressed how we felt. We’re not happy about it. We’re not happy about it at all, Kristen. Okay. One or two more. Yeah?"
2020-04-10,02:03:28,Doug,"Mister president, we hear from a lot of people who see these briefings as sort of happy talk briefings and-"
2020-04-10,02:03:36,Donald Trump,No happy talk today.
2020-04-10,02:03:37,Jim (Reporter),"And you and some of the officials paint a rosy picture of what is happening around the country. If you look at some of these questions, do we have enough masks? No. Do we have enough tests? No. Do we have enough PPE? No."
2020-04-10,02:03:50,Donald Trump,Why would you say no?
2020-04-10,02:03:51,Jim (Reporter),Do we have enough medical equipment?
2020-04-10,02:03:53,Donald Trump,I think the answer is yes. Who said no to that?
2020-04-10,02:03:56,Jim (Reporter),I’m saying this is-
2020-04-10,02:03:56,Donald Trump,"No, no, you’re saying no, but who said no? You’re asking me do we have enough masks? Yes."
2020-04-10,02:04:01,Jim (Reporter),"We hear from doctors, we hear from health experts-"
2020-04-10,02:04:02,Donald Trump,"No, you didn’t say that. You said, do we have enough masks? Do we have enough tests? Yes. Plus we developing new tests. Do we have enough ventilators? Yes. Do we have enough hospital beds? Yes. We’ve built 20,000 hospital beds. We have enough hospital beds. Go ahead Jim. Let’s go."
2020-04-10,02:04:19,Jim (Reporter),"What do you say to … I mean, you watch the coverage-"
2020-04-10,02:04:22,Donald Trump,You know what I say.
2020-04-10,02:04:23,Jim (Reporter),You’ve been watching a lot of the coverage.
2020-04-10,02:04:23,Donald Trump,"Well, a lot of it’s fake news."
2020-04-10,02:04:24,Jim (Reporter),"No, it’s not."
2020-04-10,02:04:24,Donald Trump,A lot of it’s fake news-
2020-04-10,02:04:28,Jim (Reporter),When the doctors and the medical experts come on our air and say-
2020-04-10,02:04:29,Donald Trump,The governors reported-
2020-04-10,02:04:31,Jim (Reporter),"… We don’t have enough tests, we don’t have enough masks."
2020-04-10,02:04:34,Donald Trump,"Yeah, depending on your air, they always say that because otherwise you’re not going to put them on. Let me just tell you. The governors have said last night, they had a group of governors, 14 governors. They went together someplace and they said, “It’s been unbelievable what’s happened. We’ve been totally responsive. Ventilators. Everyone has the ventilators they need.” To a point where we’re getting calls from foreign countries saying, “You have all the ventilators. Can we get some?” And we’re going to try and help some of these countries. These people have done an incredible job. This is not happy talk. Maybe it’s happy talk for you. It’s not happy talk for me. We’re talking about death. We’re talking about the greatest economy in the world, one day I have to close it off and we did the right thing because maybe it would have been two million people died instead of whatever that final number will be, which could be 60, it could be 70, it could be 75, could be 55."
2020-04-10,02:05:25,Donald Trump,"Thousands of people have died, there’s nothing happy about it, Jim. This is sad talk. This is the saddest … These are the saddest … These are the saddest news conferences that I’ve ever had. I don’t like doing them. You know why? Because I’m talking about death. I’m talking about taking the greatest economy ever created, we had the greatest numbers we’ve ever had in almost every aspect of economics, from employment to companies. Look at the airlines, they were having the best year. Now all of a sudden we have to save them. Okay, there’s no happy talk, Jim. This is the real deal and I’ve got to make the biggest decision of my life, and I’ve only started thinking about that. I mean, I’ve made a lot of big decisions over my life. You understand that. This is by far the biggest decision of my life because I have to say, “Okay, let’s go. This is what we’re going to do.”"
2020-04-10,02:06:17,Jim (Reporter),You have doctors or you have hospital administrators-
2020-04-10,02:06:18,Donald Trump,"Sure. But you have many doctors that say unbelievable job. I watched this morning and I watched a certain network and it wasn’t Fox and you had doctors saying that we’ve done an incredible job. You just read off these no, no, no. Well, we have ventilators, we have equipment, we have beds. How about beds? I mean, Governor Cuomo just told me a little while ago, he’s got plenty of beds. In fact, they are having a hard time filling Javits Center. We built them 2,900 beds. So that’s not a fair question."
2020-04-10,02:06:52,Jim (Reporter),"When you’re sanitizing masks, and you’re talking about reusing PPE, obviously you don’t have enough-"
2020-04-10,02:06:57,Donald Trump,"No, no. Excuse me. We have masks, we have everything, and we were trying to get ready for the search and a lot of people said, “It will never happen.” Deborah said it, you’ll never need that many beds. They said we needed 40,000 ventilators, 40,000 it’s like building a car. 40,000 ventilators. People said, I felt it too, you’ll never need that many. Guess what? We have tremendous … We’re the envy of the world in terms of ventilators. Germany would like some, France would like some, we’re going to help countries out. Spain needs them desperately. Italy needs them desperately. Mexico needs them desperately."
2020-04-10,02:07:38,Donald Trump,"He asked me last night, “Would it be possible to get 10,000 ventilators” within a short period of time, I’ll be able to help out Mexico. No Jim, just the opposite of your question. It’s not, no, no, no. It’s yes, yes, yes. We’re in great shape and you know what? What’s happening now is those numbers are horrible, but take a look at the number of beds. We have beds available all over New York, New York really being the epicenter. New York has experienced something that has been absolutely horrific. I saw Hart’s Island yesterday. I saw those people being buried yesterday."
2020-04-10,02:08:14,Donald Trump,"Fortunately, we have the beds and you can speak to Mayor de Blasio. You can speak to Governor Cuomo. People can’t even believe the job we’ve done. They can’t even believe it, and I give tremendous credit to the military .. There’s been a military operation with private people, but wait a minute, wait, wait. I give tremendous credit to our military, to the Army Corps of Engineers, to FEMA, to these people. The job they’ve is incredible, and you shouldn’t be asking that kind of a question, Jim, honestly-"
2020-04-10,02:08:48,Jim (Reporter),[crosstalk 00:26:49].
2020-04-10,02:08:50,Donald Trump,"I really don’t believe you’re that bad a guy, you shouldn’t be asking that kind of a question. You should say, “You know what? It’s been really incredible what’s been happening.” Jim. Nobody’s asking. What governor … Let me ask you this. What governor? We have more tests than anybody in the world. We have every … We have virtually every country in the world calling us, asking us, “How do we get these tests that you have? Your testing is the best in the world. How do we get it?” They’ve done a fantastic job. And when you ask a question like that, it’s very insulting to a lot of great people. Okay, one more, please. Please Doug."
2020-04-10,02:09:27,Doug,"Thank you mister president. You may have seen how Sweden has responded to the pandemic. The schools are open, bars and restaurants are open."
2020-04-10,02:09:34,Donald Trump,Sweden’s is different.
2020-04-10,02:09:35,Doug,Do you regret not following that approach? Is that approach working-
2020-04-10,02:09:39,Donald Trump,"I could’ve followed that approach. And if we did follow that approach, I think we might have two million people dead and Sweden is having a lot of difficulty. Look, I’m very friendly with the leadership in Sweden. They took a different approach. They’re a very disciplined country to start off with, but they did take it different, and other places tried it, UK tried it, the herd approach. Okay? Herd, and they tried it and you saw what happened in UK. It set them back a lot. A lot of time, it’s been having a tough time. Other countries have tried it and Sweden is suffering greatly. I mean, Sweden’s suffering greatly. If we did the herd, if we went with the herd as they say, we would have had potentially … I mean, you see the charts. Nobody knows. Nobody will ever know fortunately because we’re going to be substantially less than the minimum. I certainly hope, unless something happens that would be tragic."
2020-04-10,02:10:39,Donald Trump,"So they had a minimum number. If we did … One of the reasons were so far below that number is because nobody thought the American people could be so disciplined. Nobody thought it was possible. And I guess when they watched us up here every day and they watched other people and they listened to their representatives and governors, nobody thought that the American people could be so disciplined. They’ve been unbelievable. And because of that, so you have a minimum number of 100,000, and then you had the 2.2 number that if we did nothing, if we just kept working, everybody go to work, people would be dropping dead on the subways. No. If we would have lost a million people … Take the 2.2 million and cut it in half, make it … Cut it in more than half, make it a million people."
2020-04-10,02:11:28,Donald Trump,"Okay? Now take that number and cut it in half. Make it 500,000 people. That’s if we did nothing. Right? It’s unacceptable. It’s too many people. So we spent more money on stimulus. Who cares by comparison? You take 2.2 you cut it in half, you cut it in half, you cut it in half, you keep cutting it in half. I don’t care what number you choose. 500,000, 400,000. Well, we’re going to have, we were talking 50, 60, 65 maybe, maybe. But if we would’ve done what one country tried and it has been very tough for them, you know that, very, very nasty, very tough. But if we would have done that here and again, you’ve got to remember UK tried it, and I was a little surprised and I watched it … They were going about what, two weeks? And they said, “We’ve got to stop.” Because it was … They were going to have a whole country infected."
2020-04-10,02:12:25,Donald Trump,"So with all of that being said, we’ve got to get back to work. We’ve got to get our country open, but we could have lost two million people. We could have lost one million people. We could have lost a half a million people if we would’ve lost 500,000 people … Now I’ll say this also from the standpoint of being president and vice president, and we’re up there and we’re doing that herd and we’re going to bullet through it. Do you honestly think people like Jim and yourself and other people would have … Jeff would’ve put up with it? As people are dying all over, they would have said, “This man is crazy.” Because the numbers, Tony, at a minimum would have been many, many times greater than the numbers we’re talking about."
2020-04-10,02:13:07,Donald Trump,"So I’m very honored by our decisions, all of us. We talk about it all the time. I said, “Do you want to let them just, you just ride it, you just ride it right through.” We would have lost potentially millions of people. Now it would have been unsustainable. It would have been impossible to do, and the American people have been so disciplined. It’s been my honor to be their president. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again, I’ll say it always. It’s been my great honor to have been their president and I have a big decision coming up, and I only hope to God that it’s the right decision, but it’ll be based on the input from a lot of very talented people, very smart people, and people that love our country. Thank you all very much. Thank you."
2020-04-13,11:23,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, everyone. Before I begin, I’d like to offer my condolences and best wishes to the people all across our great South who have endured deadly tornadoes and other severe weather in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina."
2020-04-13,11:42,Donald Trump,"My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet. We’re speaking with their governors and representatives. FEMA’s already on its way and they got there. As soon as we heard the word. I said, “Get out there.” So FEMA’s there and you know the great job that FEMA does, it’s really something very special. So we just want to say warmest condolences and we’re with you all the way. It’s a tough deal. That was a bad, bad level five. That was a bad group. That’s as high as it gets. It was a bad grouping of tornadoes, something that’s something incredible, the power, the horrible, destructive power."
2020-04-13,12:26,Donald Trump,"America is continuing to make critical progress at our war against the virus. Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat. Nationwide flat. Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Louisiana. This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines. It’s been incredible what they’ve done."
2020-04-13,12:54,Donald Trump,"You looked at the charts, and the charts are, and the models from early on predictions were 100 and 120,000 people look like if they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish. And we’re going to be hopefully way, way below that number. So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it’s still just a horrible thing all over the world, 184 countries. This is attribute the wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning. We appreciate it so much. In fact, Dr. Fauci is here. Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further. Thank you very much, Tony. Please."
2020-04-13,13:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you Mr. President. Just a couple of things and then I just want to make a comment about something that happened yesterday. You’re going to hear from Dr. Birx soon about the numbers that we’ve been talking about, how things are starting to balance off. And I think the more as we go by each day, I think we’re going to see, and again, I never like to get ahead of myself, or of Dr. Birx. But it looks like even though we’ve had a really bad week last week, remember when I was speaking to you before I was saying this was really a bad week. There’s still going to be a lot of deaths, but we’re starting to see in some areas now that flattening, particularly in a place that was a hot spot like New York. That’s the first thing."
2020-04-13,14:25,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The second thing is that I had a really very, very productive conversation with the Congressional Black Caucus this morning for about an hour. And they really wanted to know what exactly are we going to be doing in the immediate, as well as the long range about the health disparities and the discrepancies both in infection and in poor outcome in the minorities in general, specifically African American. And I made it very clear to them that what we have to do is focus on getting the resources where the vulnerable are to be able to get testing done, to be able to get the appropriate identification where proper and where appropriate to isolate and contact trace if we can. But also to help mitigate in a community that is suffering and suffering much more disproportionately. So I just wanted to get that to the way."
2020-04-13,15:17,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The other point I wanted to make is that I, I had an interview yesterday that I was asked a hypothetical question. And hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty, because it’s what would have, or could have. The nature of the hypothetical question was if in fact we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved? And the answer to my question was as I always do and I’m doing right now perfectly honestly say, “Yes.” Obviously, mitigation helps. I’ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works. So if mitigation works and you instigate it and you initiate it earlier, you will probably have saved more lives. If you initiated it later, you probably would have lost more lives. You initiate it at a certain time. That was taken as a way that may be somehow something was at fault here."
2020-04-13,16:13,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So let me tell you from my experience, and I can only speak from my own experience, is that we had been talking before any meetings that we had, about the pros and the cons, the effectiveness, or not of strong mitigations. So discussions were going on mostly among the medical people about what that would mean. The first and only time that Dr. Birx, I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president to actually have a “shutdown”, in the sense of not really shut down, but to really have strong mitigation. We discussed it. Obviously there would be concerned by some that in fact that might have some negative consequences. Nonetheless, the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation. The next second time that I went with Dr. Birx into the president and said, “15 days are not enough. We need to go 30 days.” Obviously there were people who had a problem with that because of the potential secondary effects. Nonetheless, at that time, the president went with the health recommendations, and we extended it another 30 days. So I can only tell you what I know and what my recommendations were. But clearly as happens all the time, there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question that I just thought it would be very nice for me to clarify because I didn’t have the chance to clarify. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:17:50]. Excuse me?"
2020-04-13,17:51,Unnamed,The date?
2020-04-13,17:52,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You know what, to be honest with you, I don’t even remember what the date was. But I can just tell you the first and only time that I went in and said, “We should do mitigation strongly.” The response was, “Yes, we’ll do it.”"
2020-04-13,18:02,Unnamed,And what did he do? Was that the travel restrictions?
2020-04-13,18:04,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No. The travel restriction is separate. That was whether or not we wanted to go into a mitigation stage of 15 days of mitigation. The travel was another recommendation when we went in and said, “We probably should be doing that.” And the answer was yes. And then another time was, “We should do it with Europe.” And the answer was yes. And the next time, “We should do it with the UK.” And the answer was yes."
2020-04-13,18:25,Unnamed,"In this interview, you said there was pushback."
2020-04-13,18:27,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Yeah.
2020-04-13,18:28,Unnamed,Where did that pushback come from?
2020-04-13,18:29,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, it wasn’t. That was the wrong choice of words. You know what it was when people discuss, not necessarily in front of the president, when people discuss, they say, “Well, this is going to have maybe a harmful effect on this, or on that.” So it was a poor choice of words. There wasn’t anybody saying, “No, you shouldn’t do that.”"
2020-04-13,18:45,Unnamed,"Are you doing this voluntarily, or did the president [crosstalk 00:18:47]."
2020-04-13,18:45,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, I’m doing it…. Everything I do is voluntarily. Please. Don’t even imply that."
2020-04-13,18:53,Unnamed,"So Mr. President, the question is…"
2020-04-13,18:55,Donald Trump,"And by the way, the travel ban, that was earlier. Travel ban was done earlier. And if you look at statistics, I happened to write a couple of them down, if you look at statistics… So on January 6th, that’s long before the dates you’re talking about, CDC issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, a notice before there was even a confirmed case of the virus in the United States. That’s on January 6th. It’s all documented because we have so much fake news, I like to document things."
2020-04-13,19:29,Donald Trump,"January 6th long before the dates we’re talking about. CDC issued travel notice for Wuhan. On January 11th, we have zero cases in the United States. Zero. We don’t have any cases, so there are no cases reported that we know of. This is January 11th. The CDC issued a Level 1 travel notice for health while there were still no confirmed cases. So we had zero cases. People want me to act. I’m supposed to close down the economy, the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we don’t have one case confirmed in the United States. That’s January 11th."
2020-04-13,20:10,Donald Trump,"On January 17th to CDC began implementing public health entry screenings at three major U.S. Airports that received the greatest volume of passengers from Wuhan, at my instructions. There was not a single case of the coronavirus in the United States. So on January 17th, there wasn’t a case. And the fake news is saying, “Oh, he didn’t act fast enough.” Well, you remember what happened, because when I did act, I was criticized by Nancy Pelosi, by sleepy Joe Biden. I was criticized by everybody. In fact, I was called xenophobic. I was asking Biden to please define that for me. I was called other things by Democrats. And some others, not too many others actually, by the media, definitely."
2020-04-13,20:58,Donald Trump,"Now, on January 21st this is long before the time we’re talking, because when Tony’s talking, I believe he’s talking about the end of February. On January 21st, it was still early, there was one case of the virus at that time. We called it the Wuhan virus. Wuhan. There was one case in the whole United States. We had one case. This is all documented. It all comes from you. A lot of it comes from your people."
2020-04-13,21:27,Donald Trump,"On January 21st the CDC activated an emergency operation center. There was just one case, one person. That’s why that ad was such a phony. There was one person in the United States, you see it, there’s only one person, that statement was made at that time. One case in the whole United States, one case. I’m supposed to shut down the government, the biggest economy in the history of the world, shut it down. We have one case. Seven cases were on January 31st. Now in January 21st there was a case, not one person had died. You heard that Steve, right? Not one person."
2020-04-13,22:08,Donald Trump,"So we have this massive country, the United States of America. We have the greatest economy in the world. Bigger than China’s by a lot, right? Because of what we’ve done over the last three and a half years, prior to the virus, but including the virus. So we have the biggest economy, the greatest economy we’ve ever had, the highest employment numbers, the best employment numbers, best unemployment numbers, also, the best of everything. So on January 31st, think of it, not one person has died. Not one. Nobody died. Not one, John, I don’t think you’ll find any."
2020-04-13,22:46,Donald Trump,"This is reported by CDC, confirmed by the news, which doesn’t mean anything to me, because they don’t tell the truth. But CDC reported, January 31st not one person has died. And I issued a travel restriction from China. Think of it. So nobody died. And I issued, you can’t get earlier than that. So we have, nobody died. And I said, “China, you can’t come in. I’m sorry”, because I saw what was going on. Wasn’t so much what I was told, it was that I saw what was going on and I didn’t like it. But I didn’t speak to Tony about, didn’t speak to very many people about it. I didn’t like it. So what did I do?"
2020-04-13,23:28,Donald Trump,"Ready? January 31st in the United States, not one person had died because of, again, the Wuhan virus, so I issued travel restrictions on that date, even though nobody died and I got brutalized over it by the press, because I was way too early. I shouldn’t have done it. Brutalized by the press, but I’ve been brutalized for the last four years. I used to do well before I decided to run for politics, but I guess I’m doing okay, because to the best of my knowledge, I’m the president of the United States despite the things that are said."
2020-04-13,24:06,Donald Trump,"So then, first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years, we did. First mandatory in 50 years. The same restrictions that the Democrats in the media called xenophobic. Now Joe Biden said he’s a racist. Call me a racist, because I said, “We’re shutting down entry from China. We’re shutting it down.” He called me xenophobic and he called me a racist and other things. Since then, on a Friday night, two weeks ago, Joe Biden issued a… It wasn’t him. He didn’t write it. I’m sure he doesn’t even know that it was issued."
2020-04-13,24:46,Donald Trump,"But the people from his campaign who are smart, people that write these little PR releases are pretty smart, reasonably good, not the best, but they’re not bad. But they issued a statement saying that Joe Biden agrees that that President Trump was right to close it down to China. Now he did that. Now he issued it on a Friday night. We’ve all heard about that, John, Friday nights, right?"
2020-04-13,25:07,Donald Trump,"In fact, his was later Friday night than I ever released mine on Friday nights. Okay? [Crosstalk 00:25:12] So he did it pretty late, at like at 11 o’clock in the evening or something, it’s pretty late. Anyway, so Joe Biden issued, and it’s one of those things. But in February, Nancy Pelosi said, “We should come to Chinatown.” This is late February. “Come to Chinatown. We think it’s very safe. Come here. Let’s all have the big parade. Chinatown parade.” Probably referring to San Francisco, and that’s it. But I took this action early."
2020-04-13,25:42,Donald Trump,"And so the story in the New York Times was a total fake. It’s a fake newspaper and they write fake stories. And someday, hopefully in five years when I’m not here, those papers are all going out of business, because nobody’s going to want to read them, but now they like them because they wrote about me. Now with that, I have a couple of interesting… We have a few clips that we’re just going to put up. We could turn the lights a little bit lower. I think you’ll find them interesting and then we’ll answer some questions. I’ll ask you some questions, because you’re so guilty, but forget it. But most importantly, we’re going to get back onto the reason we’re here, which is the success we’re having. OK, please. You can put it on. Thank you."
2020-04-13,14:59,Video Woman,People should be more concerned right now with the flu in this country.
2020-04-13,15:01,Video Man,"Probably, people are concerned about the coronavirus because they’re hearing a lot of news about it right now, but the reality is comparing it to the flu, for example, it’s not even close to being at that stage."
2020-04-13,Video,Sean Hannity (Video)," (15:10) What if it is worse? Is this a moment where maybe countries put politics aside, a little bit of pride aside, and do we have US officials? Should US professionals such as yourself get involved?"
2020-04-13,15:24,Video Woman,How worried should Americans be about coronavirus?
2020-04-13,15:27,Video Man,Coronavirus is not going to cause a major issue in the United States.
2020-04-13,15:39,Donald Trump,"Well, we’ve asked them to accelerate whatever they’re doing in terms of a vaccine."
2020-04-13,15:43,Donald Trump,We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.

2020-04-13,16:03,Donald Trump,
2020-04-13,16:09,Video Woman,"As there were more cases, and it was clear that it was spreading out of China where it originated, the president took this move that he was widely criticized for by Democrats and even some Republicans at the time, which was he halted a number of flights from China into the US. The idea was to halt the spread of the disease, keep transmissions to a minimum. He was accused of xenophobia. He was accused of making a racist move. At the end of the day, it was probably effective because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus."
2020-04-13,Video,Andrew Cuomo (Video)," (16:55) His team is on it. They’ve been responsive late at night, early in the morning, and they’ve thus far been doing everything that they can do. And I want to say thank you, and I want to say that I appreciate it."
2020-04-13,Video,Gavin Newsom (Video)," (17:08) He returns calls. He reaches out. He’s been proactive. We got that Mercy ship down here in Los Angeles. That was directly because he sent it down here. Two thousand medical units came to the state of California, these FMS, these field medical stations, and that’s been very, very helpful."
2020-04-13,Video,Ron DeSantis (Video)," (17:28) The president has been outstanding through all this. The vice president’s been outstanding. Members of the coronavirus task force, very responsive."
2020-04-13,Video,Phil Murphy (Video)," (17:37) We had asked if we could have, New Jersey could have, access to a piece of the beds that are on the USNS Comfort, and the president came back, called a short few minutes before I walked in here to say indeed they would grant that to New Jersey. So that’s a big step for us in addition to all the other capacity. That news is literally hot off the press, and I thank the president and vice president who were on the call together."
2020-04-13,Video,Arizona Governor (Video)," (18:02) President Trump approved Arizona’s requests for presidential major disaster declaration. I want to thank the president for a quick turnaround. We requested this on a Wednesday, and we had approval by Saturday morning. And we are grateful to the administration for their continued support and responsiveness."
2020-04-13,Video,Larry Hogan (Video)," (18:25) Well first of all, I want to thank the president and the vice president for doing a really good job of communicating with all the governors."
2020-04-13,18:37,Donald Trump,"So we could give you hundreds of clips like that from governors, including Democratic, or Democrat as I call them, governors, which is actually the correct term. We could give you hundreds of clips just like that. We have them. We didn’t want this to go on too long, but I just want to say it’s very sad when people write false stories, like in that case, I guess it was gotten mostly from The New York Times, which is a highly… I mean if you had libel laws, they would have been out of business even before they’ll end up going out of business, so it’s too bad. But we could have given you some other statements. We have hundreds of statements, hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors, and if you look, they were all saying, “We need ventilators.”"
2020-04-13,19:27,Donald Trump,"You don’t hear ventilators anymore. They have all the ventilators they need, which we were right about. We said, “You’re asking for too many. You don’t need that.” And in all fairness, these two people right here, Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, they said, “I don’t think they need that many ventilators.” I said, “I agree.” At one point, and I’m not docking in New York for this, but they were asking, you remember, 40,000 ventilators. And that’s more than they have all over the country, and we got them a lot of ventilators and nobody’s complained. We got them, as you know, beautiful. We built hospital rooms all over the country. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, was very nice. He said, “You know what? You don’t have to build the second hospital.” Because good news is happening. They’re not able to fill the beds. They needed two hospitals. We built one. It was perfect. We’re just starting the other."
2020-04-13,20:20,Donald Trump,"I called him up. I said, “Do you think we should build the second one? I don’t think you’re going to need it.” And you said, “Let me get back.” He got back, we didn’t need it. With Governor Cuomo, in all good spirit and faith, he wanted to have the Jacob Javits Center done, and we built 2,900 incredible beds, incredible. Then we made it COVID, or to be exactly accurate, COVID-19, which was a lot of work. We had to change the duct work. We had to seal up certain areas. We had to put areas of rooftop things over the beds. We did a lot of work, and we had it… but they never really had too much use for it. And they called also, Mayor de Blasio, rightfully he called. He said, “Would it be possible to get more medical help?”"
2020-04-13,21:10,Donald Trump,"So now not only are we building facilities, they’re asking us to help because they’re unable to man it. And we got him the help. We got Mayor de Blasio a lot of help. Then when the Javits Center wasn’t used much, and then as you know, the Mercy, we took the Mercy and we took the Comfort. And we made them both Los Angeles and New York. We made them a COVID adaptable, which was not easy to do. And we didn’t get almost any people sent there. They didn’t need them at the beginning because they didn’t need it for anything but this because there were fewer accidents, fewer motorcycles, fewer everything. And what we did was an incredible job, but they didn’t need them. It turned out they were there, we were ready. You know the expression, they have an expression, “Ready, willing, and able.” We were ready, willing, and able. What the Army Corps of Engineers did was a miracle. What FEMA did was a miracle. What the doctors did, so I got a call two days ago from the mayor of New York. He said, “Could you help us even more with medical personnel?” And we sent, I think it was 448 doctors, nurses, and respiratory experts, real experts, and I got a call from the mayor and he said, “I want to tell you, incredible. These people are incredible.” He said, “They lifted the spirits of the hospital workers from New York City like nothing I’ve ever seen.” It was unbelievable, what he said was really appreciated, and I let them know that. I let the military people… He said, “They went in there so brave, so incredible. They lifted the spirits of everybody.” We did all of this work, but when you read the phony stories nobody acknowledges this."
2020-04-13,22:51,Donald Trump,"And it doesn’t have to be acknowledged from my standpoint, but it does have to be acknowledged from the great work that these doctors and nurses, the Army Corps of Engineers team, all these people, they’ve done this incredible job. And they shouldn’t be abused because you take a look at what’s happened, nobody’s asking for ventilators except outside of our country. Outside of our country, they’re calling me. Every country, they’re calling me. So many countries, and I’m going to try and help them because we have thousands of ventilators being built. But nobody’s asking for ventilators. Nobody’s asking for beds because we built hospitals. I think we built 20,000 beds in a period of a couple of weeks. The job they’ve done is incredible. With all of that being said, I’m getting along very well with the governors, and if I wasn’t… Mike Pence had a call today with the governors and it was like a 10."
2020-04-13,23:42,Donald Trump,"I said, “How was it?” He said, “It’s a 10.” He used one of my expressions actually, but he said it was a 10. And I’m sure you people were probably on the call, although you weren’t supposed to be, but you were sitting in somebody’s office listening to it because every time we have these… And you would know that for weeks those calls have been very good, but there wasn’t a raised voice. There wasn’t even a statement of, “We think you should do this or that.” I heard it was just a perfect phone call. It might not be reported that way. They’ll say, “I thought that somebody maybe slightly raised…” Didn’t even raise their voice. My only point of saying this because I want to get back to why we’re here, the press has not treated these incredible people who’ve done such a great job, they haven’t treated unfairly."
2020-04-13,24:27,Donald Trump,"They’re way off. We were way ahead of schedule, and remember this because The Times [inaudible 00:24:32] was a fake, but everything… Remember this, everything we did, I was criticized because I was too early. If I waited longer, you would have been critical. If I went way early, if I went three months earlier, I would have been criticized for being way too early. So with all of that being said, we understand it. I think I’ve educated a lot of people as to the press, and I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press. Honestly, John, there’d be nothing I would be more proud of if the press would work, and I don’t mind being criticized. But not when they’re wrong. Not when people have done a great job. Yes?"
2020-04-13,25:14,Unnamed,"Let me talk to you about the video, so I’ve never seen a video like that played in this room. It looks a bit like a campaign ad. Who produced that video for you?"
2020-04-13,25:23,Donald Trump,"That was done by a group in the office, and it was done just by… we just put some clips together. I’ll bet you I have over a hundred more clips even better than them. They were just pieced together over the last two hours. That was just… Oh, we have far better than that. That’s nothing compared to some of them."
2020-04-13,25:39,Unnamed,This was produced here in the White House by-
2020-04-13,25:40,Donald Trump,"Yeah, this was done by Dan and a group of people, and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hours."
2020-04-13,25:46,Unnamed,Why’d you feel a need to do that?
2020-04-13,25:48,Donald Trump,"Because we’re getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected. They’re saying what a great job we’re doing, these are the governors of California, governor of New Jersey, governor of New York. Look in New York, we work very close with Andrew. In New York, ventilators were going to be a problem. They didn’t have a problem. We got them tremendous numbers of… thousands, but we got them tremendous number of ventilators. You don’t hear ventilators are a problem. Beds were going to be a problem. I mean, I’m happy about it. The Javits Center, which is incredible, is almost empty because they don’t need them. That’s good news, not bad news. I’m not saying, “Gee, I wish more people were there.” I don’t want more people there. We brought in the boat. We brought in the Comfort, and the Comfort was originally not supposed to be for this at all, the coronavirus, was not supposed to be for that at all."
2020-04-13,26:36,Donald Trump,"They called, they said, “Could we have it?” That was a number of weeks ago. We said, “We don’t think you need it, but if you need it, we’ll do it.” Then they said, “Could you get the medical personnel to run the Javits Center? Could you get the medical personnel to run the ship?” We said, “If it’s necessary, we will, and we did.” There were military personnel. That’s the ones that Mayor de Blasio was so great to in terms of his statements. I mean, I really appreciated his statements. He was so impressed with them, and I am too. The level of genius and bravery, they’re great people, the military people, and we pieced that together. I would say it took less than two hours. It was done in-house. Steve?"
2020-04-13,27:14,Unnamed,"But just to be clear, this was produced by government employees, by people here at the White House, this campaign-style video here?"
2020-04-13,27:20,Donald Trump,"I wouldn’t use the word produced. All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you. And the reason they did is to keep you honest. Now, I don’t think that’s going to work. It’s not going to have any impact, but just think of it. You heard the clips, you heard what I said. They said I acted late on closing down the country. Some people wish we never closed it down. Now if we didn’t, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people interestingly, so I’m against it. We did the right thing. Everything we did was right. If we would have closed down-"
2020-04-13,27:48,Unnamed,There’s going to be dangerous [inaudible 00:27:49] along the way here. You think everything you did was right?
2020-04-13,27:51,Donald Trump,"Well look, governors should have had ventilators. They chose not to have them. We were able to get them ventilators. You haven’t heard other than there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, “We want ventilators.” They got the ventilators. You don’t have that anymore, and the surge is supposed to be coming now. And if they do need ventilators, John, we’ve got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock. We have people standing with those ventilators right now. If you needed 2000 in New York, which you don’t, but if you did, we can have them here in less than 24 hours. We’re ready to rock. [crosstalk 00:28:24] This was a great military and beyond that operation. Let’s get back to the regular. Well shouldn’t we get back to the regular?"
2020-04-13,28:31,Donald Trump,"We can talk about this, but all I’m doing is this, I could have given you… Those are four or five clips that we just played for you, I could have given you hundreds of people. Gavin was on television two days ago with one of your competitors singing praise. The question was asked in a negative way. He said, “Look, I know what you want me to say, but he’s been really good. It’s hard for me to say that. In fact, it’s impossible for me to say.”"
2020-04-13,29:02,Donald Trump,"Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. I have many clips. I have some clips from Anthony that I didn’t want to put up, which were really good. I think Anthony would be the first one to say when I closed the country to China, the China ban, whatever you want to call it, Anthony said I saved a lot of lives by doing that. I mean, am I correct? I don’t want to put words in Anthony’s mouth, by the way, and I like him. Today I walk in, I hear I’m going to fire him. I’m not firing him. I think he’s a wonderful guy. [crosstalk 00:00:29:32]. I retweeted somebody, I don’t know. They said fire, doesn’t matter."
2020-04-13,29:41,Unnamed,Did you notice that when you retweeted it?
2020-04-13,29:41,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I notice everything."
2020-04-13,29:44,Unnamed,So you retweeted it even though it said time to fire Fauci?
2020-04-13,29:46,Donald Trump,"Well, no, that’s somebody’s opinion. All that is is a opinion."
2020-04-13,29:49,Unnamed,"But you read it, and you elevated it."
2020-04-13,29:50,Donald Trump,"Well, I was called about that. I said, “I’m not firing.” In fact, if you ask your friends in the public relations office, I was immediately called upon that, and I said, “No, I like him. I think he’s terrific.” Because this was a person’s view. Not everybody’s happy with Anthony. Not everybody’s happy with everybody, but I will tell you, we have done a job the likes of which nobody has ever done. The mobilization, getting of equipment, all of the things we’ve done, nobody’s ever done a job like this. We have 50 governors and territories, by the way, people don’t ever mention that. We have territories. We have 50 governors and territories, and many of those governors are Democrats. And they can’t find anything to complain about, and honestly, many of them didn’t do their jobs. I’ll let you know someday. Let’s see what happens, but I may let you know who’s not doing their job."
2020-04-13,30:41,Donald Trump,"I can tell you the ones that are good, both Republican and Democrat, and the ones who don’t know what they’re doing. But we help some of the ones that don’t know what they’re doing. They should have had their own stockpiles, and now if they want, we can build them stockpiles of ventilators. The hardest thing is the ventilator because it’s expensive. It takes a while to get. We got them and nobody believed we did. Now, many of the governors were asking for far too many, and we said they were asking for far too many. We talked and we said, you said very strongly that they just don’t need that, but you said they don’t need that many beds, Deborah. So that’s it. Go ahead."
2020-04-13,31:18,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:31:18] you and Dr. Fauci are on the same page?
2020-04-13,31:21,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we have been from the beginning. I don’t know what it is exactly, but if I put somebody’s opinion up, I don’t mind controversy. I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing, but I want it to be honest controversy. Now, when I got a call, I got a call not very quickly, and nobody saw that as being any big deal. They said, “How are you doing with Dr. Fauci?” I said, “I’m doing great,” and I didn’t talk to Dr. Fauci even until we just got here. Dr. Fauci asked one of the people if he could get up and speak, and he did. [crosstalk 00:31:53] And they totally misinterpreted him. I saw what they did."
2020-04-13,31:56,Unnamed,"Can I ask you, he said the question was hypothetical, but what he was just acknowledging is that lives would have been saved if the mitigation practices were put into place earlier."
2020-04-13,32:03,Unnamed,That seems obvious. Do you not agree with that?
2020-04-13,32:06,Donald Trump,"Here’s the thing. Now what he really is saying though, but how could you have done it? Look, I just went over stats with you, right? Here, right here. How do you close it up? You have no deaths and no cases, on January 11th. Doctor, would you recommend closing the United States of America? Oh, this must be terrible. How many cases do we have? None. How many deaths do we have? None. January 17th, go back another week. On January 17th, this is 10 days before I did the, little bit less than 10 days, before I did the ban. I did a ban on China. You think that was easy? I then did a ban on Europe and a lot of people said that was an incredible thing to do because you look at Spain, and by the way, we’re doing very well because when you look at all of those flat graphs and you add it all up, the United States is very low."
2020-04-13,32:54,Donald Trump,"And per capita we’re very low. We’re doing very well. But how do you close up the United States of America? So on January 6th, no deaths. On January 11th, no deaths, and no cases. On January 17th, no cases, no cases, no deaths. I’m supposed to close up the United States of America when I have no cases."
2020-04-13,33:16,Unnamed,You didn’t close down until the middle of March. Should you have closed it down earlier? [crosstalk 00:33:19].
2020-04-13,33:19,Donald Trump,"I closed down from China. Excuse me, I closed it down from China. And by the way, some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out. I disagree with them, okay? But it was thought of. I mean, that was an alternative. You know, there are a lot of people that would’ve said, “Let’s ride it out.” Now, I’ll give you the good news. If I would have done that, it would have been, I think, catastrophic, because their numbers are, Anthony, 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have died if we tried to do that. And I did this last time, cut it in half."
2020-04-13,33:54,Donald Trump,"Don’t say 2.2 million. Cut it in more than half, say a million people died. Well, that’s much more than the Civil War. Cut it in half. Take the million and cut it in half. That’s 500,000 people would have died. Now that number we would’ve reached, okay? That would have been easy to reach if we did nothing. So we did the right thing and our timing was very good. But here’s the one thing, and you have to say this. When you asked me, “Why didn’t you do this?” How come when I did the ban on China, and instituted some very tough things, how come Nancy Pelosi, a month later, is in Chinatown saying, “Let’s all march. This is not going to happen.” How come we have many of the experts from CNN and many other networks, if you call CNN a network, I don’t personally, but we have CNN, we have many other places, and they’re all saying he doesn’t need to do it. He doesn’t need to do it."
2020-04-13,34:50,Donald Trump,"All I’m saying is this, how do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world, when on January 17th, you have no cases and no death. When on January 21st, you have one case and no death. One case, think of that. Now we’re supposed to close down the country? But here’s what happened. When on January 31st, I instituted the ban, Joe Biden went crazy. He said, “You don’t need the ban.” He didn’t go crazy. He didn’t even know what the hell the ban was, so he didn’t go crazy. But he did say, [crosstalk 00:35:24] he did call me xenophobic, wait a minute, he called me xenophobic. He called me a racist because… He has since apologized and he said I did the right thing."
2020-04-13,35:34,Donald Trump,"So when you say, why didn’t you do this? Every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I did it. I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives [crosstalk 00:35:43] by him."
2020-04-13,35:44,Unnamed,"What did you do with that time that you bought? The argument is that you bought yourself some time. You didn’t use it to prepare hospitals. You didn’t use it to ramp up testing. Right now, nearly 20 million people are unemployed."
2020-04-13,35:50,Donald Trump,"You’re so disgraceful. It’s so disgraceful the way you say that. Let me just, listen. I just went over it."
2020-04-13,35:57,Unnamed,Tens of thousands of Americans are dead. How is this [crosstalk 00:35:57] or this rant supposed to make people feel confident in an unprecedented crisis?
2020-04-13,35:59,Donald Trump,"I just went over it. Nobody thought we should do it, and when I did it-"
2020-04-13,36:06,Unnamed,"But what did you do with the time that you bought? The month of February. That video has a gap, the entire month of February."
2020-04-13,36:10,Donald Trump,You know what we did? What do you do when you have no case in the whole United States?
2020-04-13,36:15,Unnamed,You had cases in February.
2020-04-13,36:18,Donald Trump,"Excuse me. You reported it. Zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th-"
2020-04-13,36:23,Unnamed,"January, February, the entire month of February."
2020-04-13,36:25,Donald Trump,I said in January.
2020-04-13,36:25,Unnamed,That video has a complete gap.
2020-04-13,36:27,Donald Trump,On January 30th-
2020-04-13,36:28,Unnamed,What did your administration do in February for the time that your travel ban bought you?
2020-04-13,36:33,Donald Trump,A lot.
2020-04-13,36:33,Unnamed,What?
2020-04-13,36:33,Donald Trump,"A lot, and in fact, we’ll give you a list. What we did, in fact, part of it was up there."
2020-04-13,36:37,Unnamed,It wasn’t. Your video had a gap.
2020-04-13,36:37,Donald Trump,"We did a lot. Look, look, you know you’re a fake. You know that. Your whole network, the way you cover it is fake, and most of you, and not all of you, but the people are wise to you. That’s why you have a lower approval rating than you’ve ever had before times probably three."
2020-04-13,36:53,Unnamed,20 million people are unemployed. Tens of thousands are dead.
2020-04-13,36:54,Donald Trump,"And when you asked me that question, let me ask you this, why did Biden apologize? Why did he write a letter of apology?"
2020-04-13,37:03,Unnamed,I don’t think anyone in this room cares about why Joe Biden didn’t apologize to you.
2020-04-13,37:03,Donald Trump,"No, that’s very important. Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly? You know why? Because they really thought that I acted too quickly. We have done a great job [crosstalk 00:05:12]. Now I could have, I could have kept it open and I could have done what some countries are doing. They’re getting beat up pretty badly. I could have kept it open. I thought of keeping it open because nobody’s ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America. But if I would’ve done that, we would’ve had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead. We’ve done this right, and we really have done this right. The problem is the press doesn’t cover it the way it should be. Go ahead. One more question, Steve. Go ahead."
2020-04-13,37:47,Unnamed,There’s a debate over what authority you have to order the country reopened. What authority do you have?
2020-04-13,37:53,Donald Trump,"Well, I have the ultimate authority, but we’re going to get into that in a minute. We’re going to just finish this up. We’re going to tell you about other things that we’ve done right, but I will say this, had we said, “Let’s just keep going and let’s not do a closing,” whether it’s 2.2 that they at one point predicted as an outside, or 1.6 at a lower number, you cut it all the way down to six or seven or 800,000, take just a fraction of the number that could have happened, it literally would have been more than the Civil War. It would have been a disaster. So the minimal number was 100,000, and I think, I feel pretty good that we’re going to be substantially below, Anthony, the hundred thousand, and I hope we will."
2020-04-13,38:33,Donald Trump,"All right, so today the Department of Health and Human Services announcing five new contracts to procure large numbers of additional ventilators under the Defense Production Act, which we used a lot by the way, which you didn’t like to talk about, in addition to the 1,300 we received today. We received today 1,300 additional ventilators."
2020-04-13,38:55,Donald Trump,"Now we’re probably not going to need them, but we can add that to our stockpile, which is very big and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge. We’re ready to rock. The contracts are with General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, Resmed, and VIAIR combined with the DPA contracts that we announced last week with General Motors and Phillips, and two other contracts with Hamilton and Zole, we’re adding 6,190 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile of which we have a lot already, thousands, close to 10,000, but this will be added by May 8th, another 29,000 by the end of May, and more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year. Now we’re going to help other countries. We’re going to help states if they need it. We may help some state stockpile."
2020-04-13,39:49,Donald Trump,"You know, they’re supposed to buy their own stockpile. They have state stockpiles. They’re supposed to be using that and unfortunately most of the states weren’t there, and a lot of people didn’t want to talk about it, but they weren’t there. We will talk about it the right time if you want to. I, at this point, I’m more focused on getting past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic, anything you want to call it. We got to get past it. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. Think of that. You know, you heard all about ventilators, ventilators, we need ventilators, because they didn’t have them, because the states should’ve had them. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. No one who has needed a hospital bed has been denied a hospital bed. That’s not even really our responsibility."
2020-04-13,40:34,Donald Trump,"Now if we can help, we’re going to do it, but that’s where the Army Corps of Engineers did such a great job. We built over 20,000 beds. In fact, we built thousands more than we’ve actually needed to be safe. We wanted to be safe, and they rose to this incredible occasion. I mean, we built more beds than we thought. We thought in Louisiana, we were going heavy. And again, when I called the Governor, I said, “Maybe we shouldn’t build that second hospital because we don’t want to build it if you don’t need it.” He called back, he said, “I don’t think we’re going to need it.” They had a thousand rooms, a thousand beds, and they used a lot of them, but they didn’t need the other ones, so we stopped it because we don’t want to waste. But we’re prepared to build thousands more, should we need it. I don’t think we’re going to need it because it looks like we’re plateauing and maybe even in many cases coming down."
2020-04-13,41:21,Donald Trump,"In addition, we’ve ordered a total of 16 mobile decontamination systems. So the decontamination is system from Battelle, Ohio, is an incredible thing because it takes the masks and up to 20 times you can decontaminate a mask. And I’ve been asking from the beginning, “Why can’t we sterilize and sanitize these masks?” And it turned out we can, and there was a great company in Ohio. They sent us some great equipment and they’re doing that now, and now we’re going to have more than 33 million N95 masks per week will be cleaned, decontaminated, and it’ll be great. It’s something that frankly, I think people should have thought of a long time ago."
2020-04-13,42:07,Donald Trump,"Five more flights landed today as part of the Project Air Bridge, our massive airless lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the United States, which has now delivered nearly half a million N95 masks, 370 million gloves, 25 million surgical masks and 4.9 million gowns. So we have millions of gowns, gloves, masks, all surgical equipment coming in should the states need it. Now the states are supposed to be buying their own stuff, but should they need it, we are ready to give them because we’re building up our stockpile again like crazy."
2020-04-13,42:44,Donald Trump,"Remember, and you saw the stories, I inherited this administration, Mike, myself, the whole administration. We inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare. There was nothing, and I say it and I’ll say it again, just like we didn’t have ammunition, we didn’t have medical supplies, we didn’t have ventilators, we didn’t have a lot of things that should have been had, and you can read your own stories on that because you know what happened. They didn’t want to spend the money, but we did. To date, we’ve facilitated the supply of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide. This week we’ll be sending two million N95 masks to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Vice President will go into more detail. He’s got great detail on that and I think it’s a pretty amazing story. We have a lot of masks already in stock and we have more coming."
2020-04-13,43:35,Donald Trump,"We’re further expanding hospital surge capacity in key areas of the opening, and we have a portion of certain VA hospitals and non-veteran coronavirus patients including at the East Orange New Jersey Medical Center as well as facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn. They’re ready, they’re able, they’re beautiful. Hopefully we won’t need too many of them because frankly we built everything that the governors wanted and in many cases it’s too much. We told them it was too much, but we wanted to err on the side of caution."
2020-04-13,44:06,Donald Trump,"The United States has now conducted nearly 3 million tests for the virus, 3 million, the most of any nation. We’re performing approximately 115,000 tests every single day, and our rate of testing is especially high in areas hardest hit by the virus. If you look, and it’s hit some areas of the virus, very, very hard. For example, per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world. The NIH, CDC and FDA are also currently validating several antibody tests that will allow us to determine whether someone has already had the virus and potentially become immune to infection. We’re looking at that. The antibody tests are going to be very interesting over the next short while. A lot of things are being developed as we speak."
2020-04-13,44:54,Donald Trump,"In the race to develop effective treatments, the drug company Gilead announced that its drug Remdesivir has shown promising results, very promising in compassionate use settings. In addition, the FDA has just granted Emergency Use Authorization for a device that removes certain proteins from the bloodstream, possibly preventing a patient’s immune system from overreacting to the virus and damaging vital organs, which is a big problem."
2020-04-13,45:23,Donald Trump,"Furthermore, over the last seven days, my administration has deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from our national stockpile. We have millions of doses that we bought and many people are using it all over the country. And just recently a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that drug. So, who knows? And you combine it with Z-Pak, you combine it with zinc depending on your doctor’s recommendation, and he’s having some very good results. I’ll tell you, I think of anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place, to be honest with you. I think the fact that I recommended it, I probably set it back a lot. But it’s a lot of good things are happening with it, a lot of good tests."
2020-04-13,46:07,Donald Trump,"Scientists are also pursuing a blood therapy known as a convalescent plasma, convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat those who are sick, and this is something that actually is a very old procedure, but it’s done in a very modern way. During this difficult time, we’re also working to ensure that the 2020 census is completed safely and accuracy. We may be asking for an extension because obviously they can’t be doing very much right now. They wouldn’t even be allowed to do it. So the census, we’re going to be asking for a delay, a major delay, I think. How can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now? The Census Bureau recently made the decision to temporary suspend its field operation data collection activities to help stop the spread. In addition, while millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online, the Census Bureau has asked Congress for a 120 extension."
2020-04-13,47:07,Donald Trump,"I don’t know that you even have to ask them. This is called an act of God. This is called a situation that has to be, they have to give, and I think 120 days isn’t nearly enough. My administration’s also taking bold action to help American workers. On Friday, Americans began receiving the cash payments authorized by a historic $2 trillion relief bill. By the end of the week, nearly 80 million Americans will receive a total of $147 billion and from what the Secretary of the Treasury tells me, that’s very much on time and going very nicely. He’ll be speaking in a moment. In payments, these payments go directly into the banks and the bank accounts of these people. Millions of additional payments will follow. The typical family of four will receive $3,400, that’s for a family of four. That’s something. Additionally through our paycheck protection program, which is a tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase-"
2020-04-13,48:03,Donald Trump,"… tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase it. This has been a tremendous success. So successful that the banks should take it a little bit longer to distribute the money, but it’s going rapidly."
2020-04-13,48:12,Donald Trump,"We’ve now processed over $200 billion in loans to help small businesses retain their workers. Now we urgently need lawmakers to set aside the partisan agendas and to replenish this program with new funds, because it’s really something that has been an incredible success and they need more money to keep it going, to take care of these business and keep them open."
2020-04-13,48:35,Donald Trump,"I want to thank the many governors, health professionals, scientists, and business leaders for their incredible hard work and input over the past month. And even long beyond a month, Mike, I would say. We’ve been working together with a lot of them for it seems like forever."
2020-04-13,48:50,Donald Trump,"I’ve been having many discussions with my team and top experts. We’re very close to completing a plan to open our country, hopefully even ahead of schedule. That’s so important. We will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states. My administration’s plan and corresponding guidelines will give the American people the confidence they need to begin returning to normal life. That’s what we want. We want to have our country open, we want to return to normal life. Our country’s going to be open. It’s going to be successfully opened. We’ll be explaining over a very short number of days exactly what is going to be."
2020-04-13,49:35,Donald Trump,"We’ve also, as you probably heard, developed a committee. We’re actually calling in a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields. We’ll be announcing them tomorrow."
2020-04-13,49:49,Donald Trump,"This weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC-Plus. That’s OPEC plus additional energy producing nations, representing many of the world’s largest oil producing countries to stabilize all markets. We have, in fact, and I think you’ve seen, a big stabilization over the last couple of days. Together, countries around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrels. People are saying 10 million, but we think that the number that they’ll actually hit is going to be closer to 20 million barrels a day. That will help a lot with saving jobs all over Texas, and Oklahoma, and North Dakota, and many other of our big energy states."
2020-04-13,50:33,Donald Trump,"This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the US oil and gas industry. It’s a very monumental agreement. I want to thank Saudi Arabia and the king of Saudi Arabia, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, both. I want to thank President Putin of Russia. And I want to thank a very good friend of mine, man who’s become a friend of mine, the president of Mexico showed great flexibility. President Lopez Obrador. He showed great flexibility and tremendous intelligence doing what he did. It was not that easy for him, and I want to thank Mexico and the president. This is a very historic deal, very historic, so we’ll see how it all goes."
2020-04-13,51:18,Donald Trump,"In this time and challenge, and we are certainly in a time probably like we haven’t been in many, many decades, we are strengthened and sustained by the bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans. I’m so proud of the American people. Everywhere you look, you see the patriotism of our people shining through, and the courage of our doctors and nurses on the front lines, and the dedication of our food supply workers, and in the commitment of every citizen to achieving victory over the virus. That’s what’s going to happen. It’s going to happen sooner than people think."
2020-04-13,51:54,Donald Trump,"We’re going to be smart about it. Very, very smart about it. We’re going to be safe about it. We’re going to be listening also to the great doctors and medical professionals. Together, we’re beating back the invisible enemy, and we’re paving the way for great resurgence. It’s really a great resurgence, the American prosperity. Our country wants to go back. They want to go back to work. They’re going to go back safely. That’s what we want."
2020-04-13,52:18,Donald Trump,"I’d like now to ask Vice President Pence to say a few words, followed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. I think before we do this, because I know there’s an emergency where they want Steve to come. So what I’ll do is I’ll ask Steve to come up, secretary of the treasury. You can talk a little bit, and then maybe take a couple of questions about what’s happening. Tell them the success we’re having. Thank you very much."
2020-04-13,52:45,Steve Mnuchin,"Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. As you announced, we are very pleased that we are ahead of schedule on delivering the economic impact payments. These were what was known as the checks in the mail that we want to deliver in direct deposit. This is ahead of schedule. We started processing those last Friday. We expect that over 80 million hardworking Americans will get the direct deposit by this Wednesday. We know how important that is to all of those hardworking Americans, many of which are at home, not working at the moment."
2020-04-13,53:20,Steve Mnuchin,"If you do not receive them by Wednesday, on Wednesday, we will be launching at irs.gov, click on irs.gov, go to “Get your payment.” If you filed a tax return in 2018 or ’19, have that information available. You’ll be able to ID yourself. You’ll be able to put in your direct deposit information, and within several days, we will automatically deposit the money into your account. We want to do as much of this electronically as we can. It’s very important in this day and age. It’s more secure, and you don’t have to go to the bank."
2020-04-13,53:56,Steve Mnuchin,"If you are a social security beneficiary, you do not need to do anything. You will get a direct deposit. If you have not filed and did not need to file a 2018 and ’19 return, you can go to irs.gov now, and enter your information and authenticate yourself. Again, we are very pleased that that is ahead of schedule."
2020-04-13,54:18,Steve Mnuchin,"I’d also like to announce the progress we’re making on the new SBA program, the PPP. Let me just remind everybody, this is a brand new program that is now one week old. We have distributed and confirmed 230 billion of loans to over 4,600 lenders participating. That is multiples and multiples of anything that the SBA has ever done in one year before. I especially want to thank the broad-based community banks that are participating. Again, over 4,600 banks. If you haven’t had your loan processed, you will get it processed this week. As the president said, we’ve gone back to Congress and asked them for more money to make sure that every business has access to this."
2020-04-13,55:08,Steve Mnuchin,Let me also comment for the states. We are distributing out half the money this week to the states. That’s a week ahead of time. We’ll deliver the other half of the money to the states next week.
2020-04-13,55:19,Steve Mnuchin,"Then let me just finally comment, we’ve been working very closely with the Federal Reserve. Last week, we announced expanded facilities and new facilities that total $2.3 trillion of liquidity. In particular, I’d just like to highlight a main street lending facility that will be for companies between one worker and 10,000 people, so mid-size businesses. Also, a municipal facility for states and local governments to be able to access funds, given the shortages that they have. With that, I’m happy to answer any questions."
2020-04-13,55:54,Donald Trump,"Do you have any questions for Steve, press?"
2020-04-13,55:55,Unnamed,"Secretary Mnuchin. Thank you, sir. Both Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer have said that they’re in negotiations with you right now on additional funding for these small business loans, that package. Leader McConnell though has said that nothing should be added to the package. They should just be specific to small business loans. What is the opinion of your administration? Should there be some sort of horsetrading here, or should it just be small business loans?"
2020-04-13,56:24,Steve Mnuchin,"The president’s view, and the vice president’s, and my view is this was a bipartisan program. This SBA program, it wasn’t a Republican program, it wasn’t a Democrat program. It was a bipartisan program. We’ve committed to small businesses. We should top up that program now. I know the Democrats want to talk about more money for hospitals and states. Right now we’re just sending the money out to the hospitals and states. They haven’t come close to using that money."
2020-04-13,56:50,Steve Mnuchin,"I know the president and vice president have said, once we get the SBA done, we can go into a another funding bill. The president’s talked about potentially adding infrastructure and other things. We think there is a likelihood we will need more money. We will sit down and try to get a bipartisan bill. But this is important we deliver on small businesses. 50% of the people work for small businesses."
2020-04-13,57:13,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir."
2020-04-13,57:14,Unnamed,What’s the emergency that the president said you had to go for? The president said you had an emergency-
2020-04-13,57:20,Donald Trump,Negotiation.
2020-04-13,57:21,Unnamed,Over this bill?
2020-04-13,57:22,Steve Mnuchin,"Yeah. Well, because we don’t want to run out of money. We’ve used about 220 billion of the 350 billion. We don’t want to run out of that money. We don’t want to create panics that people won’t get it. That’s why we want to top that up, and we’ve asked for another 250 billion for that program."
2020-04-13,57:40,Steve Mnuchin,"Again, let me just remind you, every dollar we spend in this program, we save a dollar of unemployment insurance. Even though we’re asking for 250 billion, it really won’t cost that much."
2020-04-13,57:52,Unnamed,Could I follow up?
2020-04-13,57:52,Unnamed,"Do you have concerns about lifting the guidelines too soon? I mean, what’s the economic impact? I understand the economic argument for getting people back to work, obviously. But what’s the economic risk of lifting them too early and seeing a spike in cases again?"
2020-04-13,58:07,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, of course there’s economic risks in both directions. We reviewed with the president today a very broad list of over a hundred business people that are going to help advise the president on what needs to be done to reopen the economy. We want to make sure, and again, the combination of economic impact payments, small business payments, enhanced unemployment insurance. The president made very clear, we want to make sure that hardworking Americans have liquidity while we wait to reopen the government."
2020-04-13,58:37,Unnamed,"Do you believe the country, excuse me, should be reopened on May 1?"
2020-04-13,58:41,Steve Mnuchin,I’ve had discussions with the president. I know he’s considering it. I believe he’s going to make a decision later in the week.
2020-04-13,58:47,Donald Trump,Everything has to be safe. We want safe.
2020-04-13,58:48,Unnamed,What is your advice to the president?
2020-04-13,58:50,Steve Mnuchin,"My advice is as soon as it’s ready to open, and based upon the medical professionals… Again, we’re working very closely with the president and outside business leaders to develop a plan."
2020-04-13,59:00,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:59:00] ask you, Mr. President. If you could sketch for us what reopening the economy looks like, do you think it’s going to be everything open or do you think-"
2020-04-13,59:09,Donald Trump,"Well, I’ll be doing that over the next few days, because we’ll probably be making a statement about that and exactly what it looks like. I know what that looks like, but I also want to get the advice, in a sense. We have some of the biggest from every business on this council. We’re actually setting up a number of different councils or committees, I guess you could call them. We have a lot of smart people. I think that they will give us some also good advice. But no, we want to be very, very safe. At the same time, we’ve got to get our country open."
2020-04-13,59:41,Unnamed,Mr. President.
2020-04-13,59:41,Unnamed,"I don’t understand though, Mr. President. Do you think there is a possibility then that what you do is you open it incrementally? Do you think people would go back to restaurants, concert, the cinema-"
2020-04-13,59:49,Donald Trump,"I do think so. Eventually, they will. Yeah. We hope so."
2020-04-13,59:52,Unnamed,Let me ask one final-
2020-04-13,59:53,Donald Trump,"I think eventually they will do that. I think we’re going to boom. I think it’s going to go quickly. Our people want to get back to work, and I think there’s a pent up demand like there hasn’t been in a long time."
2020-04-13,01:00:05,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:00:05].
2020-04-13,01:00:05,Steve Mnuchin,One other-
2020-04-13,01:00:06,Donald Trump,"That’s why you see the stock market… I mean, to think that the stock market’s at the level it is right now with all that this world and this country has gone… And look at the European Union, how badly decimated they’ve been. Look at other countries. Look at China, by the way. I’ve seen the numbers. Look at China. Look at how these countries have been just decimated by this. And to think that the stock market is at this tremendously high number. Not that much… It was looking a little bleak for a while, but it hit a certain point and then started going up. I think that’s a great tribute to the fact that there’s a demand. Yeah."
2020-04-13,01:00:39,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you, sir. In regards to some of your tweets earlier today, and I think it was Steve’s question, my question to you is what provision in the Constitution gives the president the power to open or close state economies? And then-"
2020-04-13,01:00:54,Donald Trump,Numerous provisions. We’ll give you a legal brief if you want.
2020-04-13,01:00:58,Unnamed,"We’ll be looking forward to that, sir. But following up, what happens if you say, for instance, we want states to reopen, but California or New York do not open, what would you do then?"
2020-04-13,01:01:08,Donald Trump,"Well, I think everybody wants to open. I mean, I guess-"
2020-04-13,01:01:09,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:01:10].
2020-04-13,01:01:11,Unnamed,"Sorry, could I just ask one other thing on the-"
2020-04-13,01:01:12,Donald Trump,"I guess that could happen, but I don’t think that would happen."
2020-04-13,01:01:13,Unnamed,Mr. President [crosstalk 01:01:14].
2020-04-13,01:01:13,Unnamed,"The states that have closed, ordered schools closed, it’s been states that have ordered businesses like restaurants and bars and place-"
2020-04-13,01:01:21,Donald Trump,"That’s because I let that happen, because I would’ve preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up. But I let that happen. I like the way they’ve done it."
2020-04-13,01:01:29,Donald Trump,"The seven that remained, really, in sort of a semi-lockdown, if you look at those states, they’ve really done a very good job. They’re very much different from a New York or from other places where they’ve been hit very hard. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-13,01:01:39,Unnamed,"So you’re prepared then to [crosstalk 01:01:40] states and say, “I order you to open your schools. I order you to force kids to be able to go.”?"
2020-04-13,01:01:44,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-04-13,01:01:45,Unnamed,"Yeah. Yes, Mr. President. Following up on that, there are two consortiums of states today, California, Oregon, Washington on the West Coast, Northeastern states, totally representing about a hundred million people, who said they’re going to cooperate and decide when to reopen those states."
2020-04-13,01:02:00,Donald Trump,"Well they can decide, but-"
2020-04-13,01:02:01,Unnamed,Does that undermine what you’re trying to do?
2020-04-13,01:02:03,Donald Trump,"No, not at all. Let me just tell you very simple. I’m going to put it very simply. The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful. The president of the United States calls the shots. If we weren’t here for the states, you would have had a problem in this country like you’ve never seen before. We were here to back them up, and we’ve more than backed them up. We did a job that nobody ever thought was possible. It’s a decision for the president of the United States."
2020-04-13,01:02:31,Donald Trump,"Now, with that being said, we’re going to work with the states, because it’s very important. You have local governments. They’re pinpointed. It’s really, you talk about… It’s like a microchip. They’re pinpointed. We have local government that hopefully will do a good job. If they don’t do a good job, I’d step in so fast. But no, they can’t do anything without the approval of the president of the United States."
2020-04-13,01:14:21,Unnamed,"So if some States refused to reopen and you ordered them to, the 10th amendment of the constitution says all powers that don’t reside in the president of the Congress reside in the states, how do you overcome that?"
2020-04-13,01:14:30,Donald Trump,"Well if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election. They’re going to open. They’re going to all open."
2020-04-13,01:14:37,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:14:37] the ballot box, I think that –"
2020-04-13,01:14:38,Donald Trump,"That’s something that’s not going to happen. They want to open. They have to open. They have to get open. Every one of those states, the people want to go and they want to … Now, some will be, are in a different situation. You have, I won’t name states now, but I will over the next two or three days. I’m going to be very specific, but you have some states where this is not the kind of a problem than it is in New York or Louisiana or Michigan or other places that got hit very hard. Illinois got hit very hard, but all states want to open and they want to open as soon as possible, but they want to open safely and so do I. Yeah please."
2020-04-13,01:15:15,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Today, the French president, Emmanuel Macron , said that he will keep the shutdown down in France till the middle of May. Does that mean that the US will keep the ban of flights from New York?"
2020-04-13,01:15:26,Donald Trump,"No, France got hit very hard. France got hit very hard and again, he has to do what he has to do. He’s a friend of mine, but France, Spain has just been decimated. You look at what’s happened in Italy, it’s a very well known fact what happened in Italy. No, they were hit very hard."
2020-04-13,01:15:43,Unnamed,"Question for secretary Mnuchin. Has everybody that you would like to have, the 100 business people on the economic council, have they all been invited already? Have they all agreed to [crosstalk 01:15:51]?"
2020-04-13,01:15:52,Steve Mnuchin,They haven’t been invited yet. We just reviewed the names with the President today [crosstalk 01:15:55].
2020-04-13,01:15:56,Unnamed,And are they from all sectors? Energy-
2020-04-13,01:15:57,Steve Mnuchin,"Yes. Basically there’s vertical, so every single area of the economy, we want it to be represented."
2020-04-13,01:16:03,Unnamed,"Great. One other thing. Is there anything else needs to be done to work on industry, oil industry jobs to save oil industry jobs after the deal this past weekend?"
2020-04-13,01:16:12,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, I think there’s always things. So we’re working with Larry Kudlow. We have-"
2020-04-13,01:16:15,Unnamed,Anything specifically that needs to be done?
2020-04-13,01:16:16,Steve Mnuchin,"We have economic plans for every single part of the economy. Obviously in the case of the oil industry, they’ve been hit especially hard because you’ve had both the supply issue and you’ve had the demand issue."
2020-04-13,01:16:30,Unnamed,"Have you figured out the bail-out money for the airlines, the allocations for the airlines?"
2020-04-13,01:16:33,Steve Mnuchin,"So I’m pleased to say we’ve worked very hard. I think as you probably have seen, we put out a press release that we have now had discussions with almost all the airlines. I’ve personally had discussions with all the major airline CEOs. We specifically created an exception for small airlines that we could process very quickly and I think you’ll see, very quickly, decisions coming out. I’m very pleased with the discussion we’ve had."
2020-04-13,01:16:59,Donald Trump,We’ve had very good [inaudible 00:13: 00].
2020-04-13,01:17:01,Unnamed,Mr. Secretary?
2020-04-13,01:17:02,Steve Mnuchin,Yes.
2020-04-13,01:17:02,Unnamed,Do you still see a need for a Phase Four stimulus or is it just [crosstalk 01:17:04]-
2020-04-13,01:17:04,Donald Trump,Steve I just want to say we have had discussion-
2020-04-13,01:17:06,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:17:06] with that?
2020-04-13,01:17:06,Donald Trump,Excuse me one second. We’ve had very good discussions with the airlines. Very good discussions.
2020-04-13,01:17:12,Unnamed,Is it possible to reopen the economy on May the 1st?
2020-04-13,01:17:15,Donald Trump,I don’t want to say that. You’ll be hearing over the next few days.
2020-04-13,01:17:18,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:17:18] do you still see a need for a Phase Four this push in lieu of another stimulus?
2020-04-13,01:17:25,Steve Mnuchin,"Okay. So again, let me just comment. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, approved an unprecedented amount of money to help American workers and American business because it was no fault of their own that business was closed down. We have been very diligently executing on that. Everybody said it was going to take months to get people money. We are executing very quickly. We created a whole new SBA program in a week. Our job right now is to execute the 2.3 billion, which we can add several trillion dollars with the Fed."
2020-04-13,01:17:59,Steve Mnuchin,"The one area we are particularly concerned about is the small business program. Quite frankly, it’s even more incredibly popular and successful than we anticipated. So the President wants to be very clear. We have money for that and once we get done with that, we will review with the President. If there is more money that needs to be to support this economy, to support hardworking Americans, we will work with Congress to get that in time."
2020-04-13,01:18:22,Donald Trump,"And Steve, do you want to talk about Phase Four?"
2020-04-13,01:18:25,Steve Mnuchin,"So Phase Four, the President has talked about infrastructure for a long period of time. We’ve talked about to the extent that the hospitals need more money because of the medical issues, we’ll monitor that. We want to make sure there are incentives for restaurants, entertainment, people to get back to those types of things. So we’ll be looking at very specifically provisions to stimulate parts of the economy. Some of them may be money issues, some of them may be regulatory issues."
2020-04-13,01:18:55,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:18:55] just to clarify your understanding of your authority vis a vis governors. Just to be very specific. For instance, if a governor issued a stay at home order-"
2020-04-13,01:19:06,Donald Trump,"When you say my authority, the president’s authority, not mine, because it’s not me. This is when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be."
2020-04-13,01:19:17,Unnamed,It’s total. Your authority is total?
2020-04-13,01:19:19,Donald Trump,It’s total. It’s total-
2020-04-13,01:19:19,Unnamed,What part of the [crosstalk 01:19:19].
2020-04-13,01:19:20,Donald Trump,And the governors know that.
2020-04-13,01:19:21,Unnamed,So if a governor-
2020-04-13,01:19:22,Donald Trump,The governors know that. Now you have a couple of bands of-
2020-04-13,01:19:24,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:15:24]-
2020-04-13,01:19:24,Donald Trump,"Excuse me, excuse me."
2020-04-13,01:19:25,Unnamed,Could you rescind that order?
2020-04-13,01:19:26,Donald Trump,"You have a couple of bands of Democrat governors, but they will agree to it. They will agree it."
2020-04-13,01:19:34,Unnamed,What does the authority cover?
2020-04-13,01:19:35,Donald Trump,The authority of the President of the United States having to do with the subject we’re talking about is total. [crosstalk 01:19:41]. Yeah please go ahead.
2020-04-13,01:19:43,Unnamed,"One of the things you spoke we saw in your video about was the travel ban from Europe. As part of reopening America, do you want to reopen the borders so that people from Europe, from the UK-"
2020-04-13,01:19:56,Donald Trump,At the right time.
2020-04-13,01:19:57,Unnamed,How soon [crosstalk 01:19:57]-
2020-04-13,01:19:58,Donald Trump,"A very good question actually. Well, I would have to take a look. I wouldn’t say Italy’s doing great right now and I wouldn’t say Spain’s doing great right now and we just heard that France is extending its stay inside order. They’ve extended it. I just see that and I think for short period of time, but no. When they’re back, we want to do it very quickly, but we want to make sure everything’s good. No, right now we have a very strong ban. We’re going to keep it that way until they heal."
2020-04-13,01:20:24,Unnamed,"Weeks, months? What would you-"
2020-04-13,01:20:26,Donald Trump,"Well, I can’t tell you that. I have to see. How are they doing? France just went for another two weeks. We have to see. John."
2020-04-13,01:20:32,John (Reporter),"So Dr. Fauci said that you took his advice on the question of mitigation. He made the recommendation, you accepted and you put it into place. As you make this next decision which you have said-"
2020-04-13,01:20:41,Donald Trump,"Well, I’m not sure who … John, I’m not sure who really gave me advice on the ban. I think I took my own advice on the ban. I don’t know."
2020-04-13,01:20:50,John (Reporter),"Not the ban [crosstalk 01:20:50] the social distancing, I’m talking about, the shutting down, not of travel, but of activity. So my question is, as you make this next decision, which you have said maybe the most difficult or important decision of your presidency, will you assure the American people that you will again take the advice of the doctors of Dr. Fauci, of Dr. Birx? Will you take the advice of the health experts before you do that?"
2020-04-13,01:21:13,Donald Trump,"I will and many other people also, but I will absolutely take their advice. Please go ahead."
2020-04-13,01:21:18,John (Reporter),Would you go against their recommendation if they say you need another 15 or 30 days-
2020-04-13,01:21:20,Donald Trump,I don’t think it would be likely because I think we’re not very far from being on the same page. Please.
2020-04-13,01:21:26,Unnamed,"Yes, Mr. President. One thing that Governor Cuomo said today is that states do not have the capacity to do mass COVID-19 testing ahead of a reopening [crosstalk 01:21:36]-"
2020-04-13,01:21:36,Donald Trump,"Well, they have to do it. [crosstalk 01:21:37] supposed to be [crosstalk 01:21:38]."
2020-04-13,01:21:38,Unnamed,They can’t purchase the diagnostic tests or equipment and needs federal help. So will the states get that?
2020-04-13,01:21:42,Donald Trump,They may need help but-
2020-04-13,01:21:43,Unnamed,Will they get it?
2020-04-13,01:21:43,Donald Trump,"But they’re there. They’re on ground. They’ve got local mayors, local representatives. They have people that do it-"
2020-04-13,01:21:50,Unnamed,But needs the supplies.
2020-04-13,01:21:50,Donald Trump,"And what we did last time is unprecedented. We literally rebuild tests. We rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing. What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say. Not only were the cupboards bare as I say, but we inherited broken testing. Now we have great testing. I just left the top executives at Abbott. Who would have thought that would have happened where they have such a great test as that?"
2020-04-13,01:22:18,Donald Trump,"And in fact what I’ll do, I think unless you have any further questions for the Secretary of Treasury, do you have anybody for Steve? Anybody? Is that for the secretary of the treasury or for me? Because if it’s for me, we can wait."
2020-04-13,01:22:28,Unnamed,It’s for the secretary [crosstalk 01:22:28].
2020-04-13,01:22:29,Donald Trump,We have to get him back to work okay?
2020-04-13,01:22:30,Unnamed,"Yes sir. For Secretary Mnuchin, I have a question from one of my colleagues who’s not able to be in the room. They’re curious about the SBA rule that prevents small casinos from getting some of this relief. Is that something that you’re taking a look at? Is there going to be a change [crosstalk 01:22:48]?"
2020-04-13,01:22:48,Steve Mnuchin,"Not small casinos, but there are such things as small taverns and restaurants that have literally small gaming things, and we are coming out with some additional guidance on that. But I want to be clear, it’s not small casinos."
2020-04-13,01:23:02,Unnamed,Thanks sir.
2020-04-13,01:23:03,Unnamed,Secretary Mnuchin?
2020-04-13,01:23:04,Unnamed,Secretary?
2020-04-13,01:23:04,Steve Mnuchin,Yes.
2020-04-13,01:23:05,Unnamed,There was a letter that some house Republicans sent this weekend about the liquidity for mortgage service owners.
2020-04-13,01:23:11,Steve Mnuchin,Yes.
2020-04-13,01:23:11,Unnamed,Can you explain what you’re looking at in that front?
2020-04-13,01:23:14,Steve Mnuchin,"Sure. So I think I commented on this a week or so ago. We had a sub committee task force at FSOC that specifically studied this issue. We have all the appropriate people on it. Ginnie Mae has automatically taken some action. We’ve had conversations with the FHFA as to what they’re going to do for Fannie and Freddie. And we’ve said that to the extent they need certain authorities from the treasury, we will accommodate that. So we’re very aware of the issue. Quite frankly, we’ve been studying this issue way before COVID and had concerns about some of these non-bank servicers not being well-capitalized, but we’re going to make sure that the market functions properly."
2020-04-13,01:23:54,Unnamed,"Thank you sir. We have seen in a number of these relief bills that Democrats and Republicans have been able to push forward different non coronavirus specific funding priorities. Are you trying to keep funding specific to coronavirus and then if there are going to be other additions, for instance a change to labor rules is something that many on the left wanted. Some on the right are wondering if they should also, if you should also be pushing for their preferred add-ons."
2020-04-13,01:24:24,Steve Mnuchin,"I think our expectation has always been this is COVID related. Some people have a rather broad view of what COVID related is because it has impacted almost every single business. I think we’ve, the President has talked about the Kennedy Center, which is a good institution. Obviously that was not the major priority of the bill, but they were hit with COVID related. So, but no, the President instructed we want to be very specific in the next bill, it’s COVID related items."
2020-04-13,01:24:52,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:24:52] it’s been reported with the Kennedy Center just so you understand and that was done … The Democrats wanted it and we didn’t want that, but they wanted it in and we had to agree in order to get something done for the workers. But we want this to be for the workers and for companies that employ the workers. That’s what we’re looking for. We’re not looking for extraneous nonsense."
2020-04-13,01:25:11,Unnamed,"You argued that at the time of that the China man was being discussed, that was too disruptive to the global economy. Was that accurate?"
2020-04-13,01:25:18,Steve Mnuchin,"Let me be clear. I had nothing to do with the China ban. I wasn’t on the task force at the time. I’m not even sure I was … I think I was traveling at the time, but I never had any … I was not part of … I did become very active in after the China ban, but that report in the New York Times was not accurate. I was not part of the task force at that time and I was not involved. Matter of fact, I think I may have been traveling."
2020-04-13,01:25:41,Unnamed,A proposal by Senator Hawley to get direct payments to employers to pay people who’ve been laid off and to keep people on payroll. Does administration support that proposal?
2020-04-13,01:25:57,Steve Mnuchin,"Again, that is the PPP. The PPP is basically sending money to small business, 50% of American workers, to keep those people paid and it’s the most efficient way. Every dollar, as I said, we do through that, it’s one less dollar of unemployment and more importantly, we want those people to be associated with the business so as soon as the President is ready to open up the economy, those businesses are together. We don’t want those businesses to fall apart. That’s why this is such a successful program [crosstalk 00:22:26]-"
2020-04-13,01:26:26,Donald Trump,But are you talking about the unemployment or you’re the unemployment?
2020-04-13,01:26:28,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:26:29]-
2020-04-13,01:26:30,Donald Trump,"Sending it indirectly to the states. We would have preferred that it was sent directly to the people. The Democrats wanted it to be sent through the unemployment system. And I’ve talked to you about it, we have 40-year-old equipment in many of those systems that run by the state, but I’m hearing to getting the money out anyway."
2020-04-13,01:26:47,Steve Mnuchin,"So some of them are and some of the states aren’t, and we encourage … We’re working with the states to try to update their computers, but it’s a long haul. [crosstalk 01:26:55] thank you. Thank you Mr. President."
2020-04-13,01:26:58,Donald Trump,Phase Four Steve. Phase Four. Come on Steve.
2020-04-13,01:27:01,Unnamed,"A quick question on something you just said. You said when someone is President of the United States, their authority is total. That is not true. Who told you that?"
2020-04-13,01:27:10,Donald Trump,"You know what we’re going to do? We’re going to write up papers on this. It’s not going to be necessary because the governors need us one way or the other, because ultimately, it comes with the federal government. That being said, we’re getting along very well with the governors and I feel very certain that there won’t be a problem. Yeah please, go ahead."
2020-04-13,01:27:28,Unnamed,Has any governor agreed that you have the authority to decide when their states [crosstalk 01:27:32]?
2020-04-13,01:27:32,Donald Trump,I haven’t asked anybody because-
2020-04-13,01:27:34,Unnamed,That no one is [crosstalk 01:27:34]-
2020-04-13,01:27:36,Donald Trump,You know why? Because I don’t have to. Go ahead please.
2020-04-13,01:27:36,Unnamed,But who told you the president has the total authority?
2020-04-13,01:27:36,Donald Trump,Enough. Please.
2020-04-13,01:27:40,Unnamed,You mentioned the Vice President’s call with the governor’s today. Governor Hogan of Maryland has urged your administration to ask Congress for 500 billion to help stabilize budgetary shortfalls created by coronavirus.
2020-04-13,01:27:52,Donald Trump,It’s nice to have Governor Hogan very much. We appreciate Governor Hogan’s statement.
2020-04-13,01:27:56,Unnamed,Governor Cuomo said the CARES Act ignored state government [crosstalk 01:27:59] shortfalls. Do you [inaudible 01:28:01] that request and [crosstalk 01:28:02]-
2020-04-13,01:28:01,Donald Trump,Which one? Where is it?
2020-04-13,01:28:03,Unnamed,He said the CARES Act ignored the budgetary shortfalls.
2020-04-13,01:28:08,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re looking at things in Phase Four where they talk about states and they’re also talking about hospitals. They’re talking about States who have been battered and they’re also talking about hospitals and we’re certainly willing to look at that."
2020-04-13,01:28:21,Unnamed,Will you urge Congress on their behalf?
2020-04-13,01:28:22,Donald Trump,We’ll see what we all come back with but they are talking about states and they’re talking about hospitals. [inaudible 00:24:29].
2020-04-13,01:28:29,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President. Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has on Thursday signed an executive order banning the sale of non-essential goods. If other states follow her-"
2020-04-13,01:28:39,Donald Trump,The sale of what?
2020-04-13,01:28:40,Unnamed,"Non essential goods. She has banned the sale of non essential goods. Many are calling this draconian, unconstitutional. As president, do you think that if other states were to follow her example in the coming weeks that the federal government should intervene?"
2020-04-13,01:28:56,Donald Trump,"Well I don’t think that’s going to happen. I think it’s very extreme, but she’s doing it and I think it’s going to be over a long way before we have to start thinking about it too much. It is strong. It’s a very strong position to take, but they’re making a lot of progress in Michigan, so let’s see how it all works out."
2020-04-13,01:29:12,Unnamed,What is the status of the funding for the World Health Organization?
2020-04-13,01:29:15,Donald Trump,"We’re going to be talking about that very soon. I’m getting a full report. I’m not happy with the World Health Organization. Not happy with the World Trade Organization either. We’ve been ripped off by everybody. We have, this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it’s the World Health or World Trade. They’re like, I call them, the Bobbsey Twins. They look at our country, for years and years, we had people that did nothing about it. We’re doing a lot about it. So we’ll have a report and we’ll also, we’re also talking about the World Trade Organization, but we’ve made a lot of progress there. We’re now winning cases for the first time because they know I’ll leave if we don’t get treated fairly."
2020-04-13,01:29:52,Donald Trump,"This country, our country, was at a point where we’ve rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization, but now we’re winning a lot of them because they know I’m not playing games. We will pull out if we have to. We just won a $7 billion lawsuit, which was very nice."
2020-04-13,01:30:11,Unnamed,Do you expect a decision this week on cutting funding for the WHO?
2020-04-13,01:30:14,Donald Trump,"Yeah. I would say by the end of the week, I’m going to make a decision, yeah. Right now there’s a lot of things happening. Go ahead."
2020-04-13,01:30:21,Unnamed,"From China, why are there no consequences for China for the misinformation that they shared-"
2020-04-13,01:30:27,Donald Trump,How do you know that there are no consequences?
2020-04-13,01:30:28,Unnamed,"Well, you’ve been asked and it appears that they’re weren’t-"
2020-04-13,01:30:28,Donald Trump,How do you know that there are no consequences?
2020-04-13,01:30:29,Unnamed,What are the consequences Mr. President of the misinformation-
2020-04-13,01:30:30,Donald Trump,I wouldn’t tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you?
2020-04-13,01:30:34,Unnamed,But people are concerned that they stone-walled [crosstalk 01:30:35]-
2020-04-13,01:30:35,Donald Trump,"No, you started off by saying why are there no consequences?"
2020-04-13,01:30:39,Unnamed,"But you’ve been asked this a few times, [inaudible 01:30:39]. Why are there no consequences for China?"
2020-04-13,01:30:41,Donald Trump,How do you know that there are no consequences?
2020-04-13,01:30:43,Unnamed,Because we’ve asked you and said-
2020-04-13,01:30:44,Donald Trump,You’re going to find out.
2020-04-13,01:30:45,Unnamed,You’ve said [crosstalk 01:30:45].
2020-04-13,01:30:45,Donald Trump,I wouldn’t tell you. You’d probably be the last person on earth I’d tell.
2020-04-13,01:30:48,Unnamed,So you’re saying there was no consequences?
2020-04-13,01:30:49,Donald Trump,"Go ahead. Yeah, please."
2020-04-13,01:30:51,Unnamed,"Mr. President, actually this is a question for Mr. Vice President. Do you agree with the President’s statement and his understanding of federalism that his power is total in a way that he described it? Is there anything you’d like to add or any context you’d like to add to the way he was discussing that?"
2020-04-13,01:31:07,Mike Pence,"I support the president’s leadership under the national emergency declaration that he signed. We’re standing before you today, the first time in American history, when all 50 States have issued emergency declarations and the territories. This is an unprecedented time in the life of the nation. Unfortunately, as the President’s reflected and our health experts will continue to reflect, because the American people have heeded the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America, because state governors have taken those and implemented them even in States where there was not a significant outbreak, and implemented additional measures as we provided them with data about cases and best practices, we’re making real progress as a country. But make no mistake-"
2020-04-13,01:32:00,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:32:00] more circumscribed than total.
2020-04-13,01:32:03,Mike Pence,"Well, make no mistake about it. In the long history of this country, the authority of the President of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. You can look back through times of war and other national emergencies. And as the president said, we’ll happily brief that. But in the days ahead, what the president’s charged us to do is to work with our health experts. We’re going to bring together an extraordinary group of American business leaders to council the president. And then working with the CDC, we’re going to produce new guidelines based upon the data for every state and territory in this nation. We’re going to give them guidance and as the president’s indicated, we’ll continue to respect the leadership and partnership that we’ve forged with every governor in America, but this is an unprecedented time."
2020-04-13,01:32:58,Mike Pence,"But I have to tell you, when you look at the fact, despite the heartbreaking loss of more than 22000 Americans, when you look at the fact of what the health experts told us this could be, I think I only can feel a sense of gratitude to the American people, gratitude to the extraordinary team that has counseled this President, the steps of President Trump has taken, the policies that governors have implemented all across America. We were discussing today at the task force that when you look at the European Union as a whole, they have nearly three times the mortality rate that the United States of America has today, and that is a tribute to our extraordinary healthcare workers, their dedication, their tireless work. But it’s also a tribute to the fact that the American people put into practice the mitigation efforts that the President counseled the nation to do on the advice of our best scientists now more than a month ago. And our hospitals were not overwhelmed and are not overwhelmed at this hour."
2020-04-13,01:34:09,Mike Pence,"And I have to tell you, standing here today, I couldn’t be more proud to stand alongside this president and to be a part of this team that has served the American people during this challenging hour. And I’ll just say to you, to every American looking on, as we see the numbers leveling and maybe even beginning to go down, I just encourage you to keep doing what you’re doing. Because of the sacrifices that Americans and American families have made through these mitigation efforts, you’re saving lives and you’re seeing our nation through this time."
2020-04-13,01:34:46,Unnamed,"Sir, did the States tell you, you’ve been talking to the governors quite a bit. Did those coalitions of states on the West coast and in the Northeast, did they tell you what they were going to be announcing before they announced it?"
2020-04-13,01:34:59,Mike Pence,Governor Phil Murphy and the Governor of Connecticut expressed today that they were going to be speaking on and discussing on a regional basis what their recommendations would be. And we assured them today-
2020-04-13,01:35:11,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:35:11] house about that though sir?
2020-04-13,01:35:11,Mike Pence,"We assured them today on our conference call with I think 48 governors that were with us today for the better part of an hour and a half, we told them that what the president would be producing is directed to be produced are additional guidelines for the states, certified by the CDC, that would inform those governors and local communities and mayors about the best way forward based on the unique circumstances that those states and those communities are facing."
2020-04-13,01:35:43,Mike Pence,"I think what’s clear is the American people have seen the experience in Washington State, where this really all began for us, and in California, and now the extraordinary challenges in the greater New York City area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, the challenges in New Orleans and Louisiana and Detroit, still Chicago-"
2020-04-13,01:36:02,Mike Pence,"… New Orleans and Louisiana and Detroit, still Chicago, parts of Houston, but they’re also seeing that in each one of those cases that the mitigation efforts are truly working. So we’ll work with those States, and in some cases it’ll make perfect sense for them to work together on a regional basis."
2020-04-13,01:36:20,Unnamed,But you know ahead of time what they were planning?
2020-04-13,01:36:22,Donald Trump,[inaudible 01:36:24].
2020-04-13,01:36:24,Mike Pence,The president will be …
2020-04-13,01:36:26,Donald Trump,You don’t know that yourself.
2020-04-13,01:36:26,Mike Pence,"I’m sorry, I didn’t hear your question."
2020-04-13,01:36:28,Unnamed,Can you tell us? Did they let you know?
2020-04-13,01:36:29,Donald Trump,[inaudible 01:36:31].
2020-04-13,01:36:29,Mike Pence,I didn’t hear what you said. I’m sorry.
2020-04-13,01:36:30,Donald Trump,"We would like to have their cooperation, and we are going to have that cooperation. They will cooperate perfectly. Watch."
2020-04-13,01:36:42,Mike Pence,"Let me just affirm what the president said. We heard it again today in what I think was our ninth conference call with governors is I think every American would be proud to see the partnership that this president has forged with governors across the country. It is an extraordinary statement, and you’ll see some data when Adam Polowczyk gets up in just a few moments, but the flow of resources from around the world that we’ve moved into areas that have faced challenges … I mean, this president has directed us to ensure that every state has what they need, when they need it. The spirit that I heard again from republicans and democrat governors today was reflective of that partnership, and as we move forward to the president’s goal of reopening America, we expect the same kind of partnership in the interest of the nation."
2020-04-13,01:37:31,Donald Trump,"All right, go ahead."
2020-04-13,01:37:34,Unnamed,"Sir, if you can hear me through the mask."
2020-04-13,01:37:37,Donald Trump,Barely. I hear you well.
2020-04-13,01:37:39,Unnamed,"The District of Columbia argues that they were short changed in the most recent funding bill, because they were treated as a territory instead of as a state. Will that be made right in phase four?"
2020-04-13,01:37:52,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re looking at that certainly. I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we’ve done, and she was on today saying very good things. Okay, yeah. Go ahead in the back."
2020-04-13,01:38:03,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you talked about this being the most difficult decision that you’re going to have to take about whether to reopen the economy. I wonder how much it weighs on your mind the thought that if there is a second wave, you’ve reopened the economy and you might have to shut things down again."
2020-04-13,01:38:20,Donald Trump,"It does, and I hope that won’t happen. I certainly hope that won’t happen, but it does weigh on my mind. Okay, in the back. Go ahead. Go ahead, yes."
2020-04-13,01:38:26,Unnamed,Mr. President?
2020-04-13,01:38:29,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-13,01:38:33,Unnamed,Thank you. A question for one of my colleagues who wasn’t able to be here. China deployed an aircraft carrier to the South China Sea this weekend amid claims by Chinese state media that COVID has reduced U.S. military readiness in the region. What kind of responses are you thinking of? Will you have a response to this action?
2020-04-13,01:38:57,Donald Trump,"China has their own difficulties. We have a relationship with China that we’re not happy with certain things that happened over the last period of time, as you know, and I’ve been very explicit on that, but we know all about that and know China is … We’ve seen what they did. We’ve seen many other things that they’ve done both pro and constitution, and we’ll be just fine."
2020-04-13,01:39:24,Unnamed,"At the [crosstalk 01:39:25] earlier where you said that you’re putting together the economic task force and that you thought that the recommendations were happening earlier than expected, did you mean to suggest that it could be before May 1st that you start recommending?"
2020-04-13,01:39:36,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to say that, but we’re going to be putting our guidelines and recommendations fairly quickly in a few days."
2020-04-13,01:39:43,Unnamed,You’re not rolling out that it would be before?
2020-04-13,01:39:44,Donald Trump,"I’m not going to say it, but look. Certain states are doing very well. Certain big parts of the country are doing very well. They’re doing really very well, so we’re going to be putting out recommendations and guidelines very soon. Stay with us."
2020-04-13,01:39:55,Steve (Reporter),"What would your guidelines be? Would they fit each area, or would they be a uniform set of guidelines?"
2020-04-13,01:40:00,Donald Trump,"See, I don’t want to tell you now, but right now we have a very strong indication that we know pretty much we have some good ideas. I also want to have … We’ll have video conference or at least a conference call with a lot of very good people having to do with certain fields, whether it’s energy or whether it’s entertainment and restaurants, et cetera, et cetera. We have to get people back into restaurants. We have to do what we have to do, whether it’s deductability or not. We’ll see, but it should be deductability. You’ll get them back so fast. I mean, they used to have deductability. The restaurant business, it was one of the hot businesses, and then they ended it a long time ago, many years ago, but we may need that to get people back into the restaurants."
2020-04-13,01:40:43,Unnamed,Yep. Michelle Obama today got behind mail-in voting nationwide as a possible solution to what’s been going on in the states. She said it shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Have your advisors told you that that could save lives?
2020-04-13,01:40:56,Donald Trump,Absentee ballot are you talking about?
2020-04-13,01:40:58,Unnamed,"Yeah, but on a massive scale because of the coronavirus."
2020-04-13,01:41:00,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t know what she did. I mean, I didn’t see that. When did that happen? Today?"
2020-04-13,01:41:03,Unnamed,"Yeah, today. That’s a nonpartisan group."
2020-04-13,01:41:05,Donald Trump,I wish her a lot of luck.
2020-04-13,01:41:06,Unnamed,"On Abbott labs, you said-"
2020-04-13,01:41:06,Donald Trump,"Please, go ahead."
2020-04-13,01:41:08,Unnamed,"Yes, Mr. President. There’s a little bit of confusion about your phone calls yesterday with President Putin. The Kremlin is saying that you discussed current issues of ensuring strategic security. That wasn’t referred to in the White House readout. Can you enlighten us?"
2020-04-13,01:41:28,Donald Trump,"We discussed many things. We did discuss China. We discussed many different things, but it was primarily a call on the oil, as you can imagine, and they were very helpful in getting a stabilization price, a stabilization of the number of barrels. I think the number is going to be closer to 20, maybe 15, but closer to 20 than it is going to be to 10, and I think it was a very important call. I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia, and that was a very important call. The bottom nine is OPEC+. It’s called OPEC+ because there are other states, also other nations. We came to a very good agreement. Please. Go ahead."
2020-04-13,01:42:04,Unnamed,What was the part about strategic security? Was that …
2020-04-13,01:42:07,Donald Trump,"I would say mostly we were talking about China. We were talking about their borders, and we were talking about our borders a little bit, our borders with Mexico, because as you know, Mexico was a big part of the deal. Mexico, really, it was very complex from the standpoint of Mexico. It was not an easy deal for Mexico and the president. We appreciated a certain amount of flexibility, but we talked about borders, we talked about China, talked about Mexico."
2020-04-13,01:42:31,Unnamed,Security sounds more like arms treaties.
2020-04-13,01:42:32,Donald Trump,"Well, we did talk about the arms. Yes, we did. That was a very important part of the call actually. Yeah, good point."
2020-04-13,01:42:39,Unnamed,"So on Abbott Labs, you said testing is going great. We know that these machines had been sent to some of the governors, but some of them were saying they don’t have the materials to actually conduct the tests."
2020-04-13,01:42:50,Donald Trump,"Well, they have to get the materials. The governors have to get the material. Now, if they can’t get it, they’re going to see us."
2020-04-13,01:42:54,Unnamed,The federal government has distributed-
2020-04-13,01:42:56,Donald Trump,"I’m talking about the local government. I’m talking about governors have to get the material. Now, they have machines. In fact, we were going to go into it. Why don’t you ask Mike, to go into it as soon as I leave? They have very powerful machines that they don’t know they even have. I’m not talking about Abbott, I’m talking about the governors. They have machines that are used for this. You know what I’m referring to?"
2020-04-13,01:43:14,Unnamed,"I do, the two different machines."
2020-04-13,01:43:15,Donald Trump,"Very big, very powerful machines where in a certain state’s case, they’re only using 10% of their capacity and they didn’t know it. That happens to be Illinois."
2020-04-13,01:43:23,Unnamed,"Okay, well, real quick. These 15-minute tests that you’ve sent out, these new ones that you had in the Rose Garden, they say, including Governor Sununu in New Hampshire, that they don’t have the cartridges to actually conduct the test, so when will they get those cartridges?"
2020-04-13,01:43:36,Donald Trump,What do you think the answer to that is?
2020-04-13,01:43:39,Mike Pence,We’re rapidly increasing the numbers.
2020-04-13,01:43:40,Donald Trump,Rapidly increasing the numbers.
2020-04-13,01:43:40,Unnamed,Are we looking at tripling?
2020-04-13,01:43:41,Donald Trump,"Rapidly increases. Well, pretty quickly. Yeah?"
2020-04-13,01:43:43,Steve (Reporter),"They can show 50,000 a day."
2020-04-13,01:43:45,Donald Trump,"Well, you have other machines where they can really work. A lot of the states have the big machines that can do a lot. They didn’t even know they had them. They didn’t even know that they had them, and Mike is going to be talking about that."
2020-04-13,01:43:57,Unnamed,Remember you mentioned several weeks ago that Google was putting together that website or that would handle the drive through testing.
2020-04-13,01:44:04,Donald Trump,Google and Apple.
2020-04-13,01:44:05,Unnamed,Have you given up on it? Have you moved past that?
2020-04-13,01:44:08,Donald Trump,"A lot of people don’t like it from the standpoint of constitutional rights. A lot of people don’t like it, and some people think it’s great. No, they are working on that as I understand."
2020-04-13,01:44:17,Unnamed,I’m talking about the testing website. Remember you said a website for Google. It’s only operating in I think five counties in California right now.
2020-04-13,01:44:24,Donald Trump,"No, Google’s looking at it, but Google is also working with Apple, who are looking at something. We have the greatest companies in the world looking at things that, in a year from now, everything that we’re looking at now is going to be obsolete. That’s how good it is. We have things happening that are unbelievable. I saw a presentation today that I can’t talk about yet, but it’s incredible. Plus, I think they’re doing … Tony, I think they’re doing very well in the vaccines. They’re working hard on the vaccines, and I think you’ll have an answer for vaccines. I believe that there’s some great things coming out with respect to that. Now, you need a testing period, but you’re going to have some great things. Please."
2020-04-13,01:44:59,Unnamed,"Yeah. Sir, on the contact tracing that Google and Apple are doing, so different subject, on the contact."
2020-04-13,01:45:04,Donald Trump,"No, this is the Google and Apple. I don’t know if it’s a partnership or what, but they’re working on some-"
2020-04-13,01:45:08,Unnamed,Correct. There’s the one-
2020-04-13,01:45:09,Donald Trump,"They’re working on more than one element. They’re working on a couple of different things, Google and Apple. Google is also working on something as you know, having to do with testing. I believe they’re doing that in a singular fashion."
2020-04-13,01:45:20,Unnamed,"So my question is not about the drive through testing website, not that. On Google and Apple’s contact tracing that they’ve got this process now where they can put contact tracing on your phone. If you opt in, you can be alerted if you’ve been in contact with someone with the coronavirus. How do you feel about that?"
2020-04-13,01:45:36,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s an amazing thing, but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problems with it. You know that. It’s an amazing thing, and would be actually, as you know, other countries are thinking about using something similar, but not as good."
2020-04-13,01:45:49,Unnamed,Which other countries are thinking about doing something?
2020-04-13,01:45:51,Donald Trump,"I hear Singapore is. Singapore had a little bit of a setback, because they had a break. You know that, but they’ll take care of it. I know the folks in Singapore, they’re doing a great job, and they’re going to put it back very quickly, but Singapore and other countries are looking at other things, and some countries are doing other things."
2020-04-13,01:46:10,Unnamed,Would you prefer that Americans use some other thing?
2020-04-13,01:46:11,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t want to get into that, because we have a whole constitutional thing. We have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem, but we will be making a determination on that. That’s something we’re going to be discussing with a lot of people over the next four weeks. That would be a very accurate way of doing it, but a lot of people have a problem with it. Yeah, please. Go ahead."
2020-04-13,01:46:30,Unnamed,A testing question maybe for Dr. Fauci as well. Can you talk about where the antibody test is and how quickly it’s happening?
2020-04-13,01:46:37,Donald Trump,"It’s moving along. I think I can answer it, because I have to leave. Moving along quickly, moving along well .it’s a test that’s been going along for many, many years, except now we have very modern, very incredible versions of it, but that’s moving on. The antibody test, moving along very well. Okay, any more COVID-19? COVID-19?"
2020-04-13,01:46:56,Steve (Reporter),"[inaudible 01:46:56] Theodore Roosevelt has died. Have you decided the status of Captain Crozier, the former [crosstalk 00:11:03]."
2020-04-13,01:47:02,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s going through the Navy as I understand it. The Navy is going to be making decisions on all of that, and they had a break in. I don’t think the ship should have been stopping in Vietnam when you have a pandemic to be honest with you. I don’t think the captain should have been writing letters. He’s not Ernest Hemingway, as I said before, and he shouldn’t have been writing letters. I don’t know who gave the orders to stop in Vietnam, but they stopped in Vietnam, and all of a sudden they get on and now you have over 500 sailors and people on the ship that are affected. I don’t know whose idea that was, but that wasn’t such a good idea in the middle of a pandemic. Yes, please?."
2020-04-13,01:47:42,John (Reporter),One last thing on this question on this question of constitutionality. I’m just wondering what changed your view because-
2020-04-13,01:47:46,Donald Trump,"Nothing changed it. I know exactly what you’re going to say. Nothing changed it. The fact that I want to rely on states, or maybe will or have, and the fact that we’ve gotten on, that’s one thing. The fact that I don’t want to use the power is another thing. Look-"
2020-04-13,01:47:59,John (Reporter),But you said from the standpoint of the constitution.
2020-04-13,01:48:02,Donald Trump,"Yes, the constitution."
2020-04-13,01:48:03,John (Reporter),You thought it should be up to the governors.
2020-04-13,01:48:05,Donald Trump,"You can look at it constitutionally, you could look at federalism. You can look at it any different way. John, the fact that I don’t want to exert my power is much different. We have the power. You asked does the federal government has the power? The federal government has absolute power. It has the power as to whether or not I’ll use that power. We’ll see."
2020-04-13,01:48:23,John (Reporter),[crosstalk 00:12:24].
2020-04-13,01:48:24,Donald Trump,"John, I would rather work with the states, because I like going down to a local government. That’s why, with I guess it’s now seven states, not eight, because South Carolina did. They went away from what we discussed the last time, so that’s why I looked at the individual states. They’re doing a very good job. They’re really doing a very good job. I’d rather have them make the decision. Now, the fact that I’d rather have, that’s fine, but I have the absolute right to do if I want to. I may not want to. We have a very good relationship now. We’ll see what happens. If you notice the few states you’re talking about, they’re all with democrat governors, but if governors are doing a good job and they control it better, because you don’t have somebody in Washington saying, “Set up a testing site in the parking lot of a Walmart.” We’re in Washington, and they’re in a state that’s very far away."
2020-04-13,01:49:15,Donald Trump,"That’s really, it should be, and it should have always been. I’ve always said it was, but the relationship we have now with the states and governors is very good, and we’ll be announcing over the next very short period of time exactly what we’re going to be doing. Okay, a couple more. Go ahead."
2020-04-13,01:49:30,Unnamed,"On coronavirus and Joe Biden, he’s the presumptive democratic nominee. Do you have any plans yet on when you’ll start sharing or when the White House will start sharing some of that information about the coronavirus? Your president [crosstalk 01:49:42]."
2020-04-13,01:49:41,Donald Trump,"Well, nobody’s called about what about coronavirus from their standpoint. Look, they had the H1N1, and that was a big failure. That was a tremendous failure. They had a lot of failures. You take a look at the history, and 17,000 people died, and you talk about late. They were so late, they were late like it never even existed. That was a big problem. It caused a lot of other people a big problem too. If Joe Biden would like a briefing, I’d certainly get him a briefing. I don’t know what he’d do with it. Yeah, please."
2020-04-13,01:50:23,Unnamed,"Are Jared and Ivanka serving on new task force, and how are you going to balance-"
2020-04-13,01:50:27,Donald Trump,No.
2020-04-13,01:50:28,Unnamed,What?
2020-04-13,01:50:28,Donald Trump,"No, they’re not. Yes, go ahead, please."
2020-04-13,01:50:29,Unnamed,"Just wanted to clarify. In earlier conversation, there was a description of multiple different councils or task forces. Can you just explain exactly what the structure is of those [crosstalk 00:14:42]."
2020-04-13,01:50:40,Donald Trump,"Well, you have Mike’s task force, which is the White House task force, which really brought us up to this point brilliantly, I must say. Dealt with governors and dealt with governors all the way through. I was on many of those calls, and every call got better and better and better. It was hostile at the beginning. By the time we finished, today’s call was a very good call, very friendly call. I think everyone’s online, and again, you don’t have anybody driving you crazy saying they’re not getting ventilators and not getting all of the different things, they need more beds. They have a lot of beds right now. We always are, and I think it’s important."
2020-04-13,01:51:15,Unnamed,[inaudible 01:51:16].
2020-04-13,01:51:16,Donald Trump,"We always erred on the sake of give them more, even when we didn’t think … We didn’t think New York needed the beds that they were asking for. We didn’t think they needed the ventilators that they asked for, and they were right. Now, on ventilators, we’re ready to march. I told you this. We’re ready to march. We have 10,000 ventilators. We’re ready to move them anywhere in the country where we need them, if we need them. We’re also building lot of ventilators, and that’s going to be used at some point, I believe. We’re going to have stockpiles including state stockpiles if they want to work out some kind of an arrangement with us, but we’re also going to help other countries, whether it’s Italy or Spain or other. France is having a big problem. They all desperately need. Germany too. They need ventilators, so we’re going to have a lot of ventilators. We have a lot. You heard the numbers. We have a lot coming next week. Next week, we have a tremendous amount coming. Okay, final question."
2020-04-13,01:52:06,Unnamed,I’d ask how the task force is going to be structured. Is it one?
2020-04-13,01:52:09,Donald Trump,"No, but then we have, in addition to that, we have a number of committees. We’ll have a transportation committee. We’re going to have a manufacturing committee. You’ll see it tomorrow. We’re also having a religious leaders committee. We have a great group of religious leaders. We’re having committees with religious leaders. You’ve been seeing what’s going on at the churches and all of that, and we’re going to have a faith leaders committee. We’re going to have a few committees. I’ll call them committees, and then ultimately we’re going to make decisions. We’re going to make decisions fairly quickly, and I think they’re going to need to be the correct decision. I hope so. Steve?"
2020-04-13,01:52:46,Steve (Reporter),You form the economic task force tomorrow. When do you want them to have recommendations for you?
2020-04-13,01:52:51,Donald Trump,"Soon, and they already know what I want. When we form, when you say form, I don’t have to give them instructions. These are very sophisticated people. These are the best people in their fields, so I’d have to say, “Gee, we just met, and we’re going to meet in two weeks, and here’s what we’re …” I said, “Here’s what I want. We’ve already told them, and they’re the best names in the various businesses and professions and religions. These are the greatest names, the people that I think probably know the best, so we’ve called them and we’re going to be speaking to them very soon. If it’s questions or statements, we want them to have that for us, and we will have either response. Or maybe, ideally we’re going to be learning from them, and we’ll be able to do that and put everything we learn from those calls into our new guidelines. We’re going to have new guidelines coming soon. I think it’s going to be very good. I think it’s going to be very smooth, and I hope it’s going to be very safe. Thank you all very much."
2020-04-13,01:53:48,John (Reporter),Any thoughts on Stanley Chera? Any thoughts on Stanley Chera?
2020-04-13,01:53:51,Donald Trump,"Stanley Chera is a friend of mine for a long time. He’s a great real estate person, passed away. Was a great real estate person. Great, great. Sort of a legend in New York real estate. He called me a couple of weeks ago, said he’s tested positive. Stanley’s in his early to mid-80s I guess, and Stanley went to the hospital, and he never came out. He went into a coma. He was unconscious for a long period of time, and he never made it. A great man. He left very charitable, really a great philanthropist, a very, very successful person in Manhattan, in the real estate business. I got to know him a lot."
2020-04-13,01:54:39,Donald Trump,"He was so excited when his friend from New York became the President of the United States. He was like a young boy, and he was not a young boy, but he was like a young boy. He was so excited. He thought I would do such a good job, and he was so happy. He was very proud of what we’ve done in this administration, but he was tested positive, and unfortunately he didn’t make it. To me, it’s a very sad thing. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thanks, doctor. Thank you."
2020-04-13,01:55:16,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. As the president mentioned, the task force today spoke to 48 of the nation’s governors. On that call, we reflected on the fact that all 50 States had emergency declarations in place, which was a first for American history. 5.2 billion dollars had been distributed to the states under the Stafford Act, and it was a productive call and reflective of President Trump’s ongoing direction for us to work closely with the states to make sure the states in the areas most impacted by the coronavirus have what they need when they need it. We spoke about the issue of testing and supplies, and I’m going to ask Dr. Deborah Birx to come forward as well as Admiral Polowczyk to reflect on both of those topics for you."
2020-04-13,01:56:12,Mike Pence,"Dr. Birx has been leading an effort from the task force from early on on rapidly expanding testing. It was early on that the president formed that public-private partnership with commercial labs, and as we stand here today, more than a 2.5 million tests have been performed, and when we add in the estimates of labs that we have to assume, with reasonable projections, have not yet reported in to the CDC, we think that number could be closer to three million tests that have been performed."
2020-04-13,01:56:50,Mike Pence,"As has been mentioned, the new 15-minute test, we are working closely with Abbott Laboratories that the president and our team met with today here at the White House to rapidly increase the availability of cartridges. Abbott is producing roughly 50,000 cartridges a day. FEMA acquired an initial supply of that and distributed those to the states, but we’re working with the states to not only distribute what’s being made, but also work with other suppliers to create additional cartridges. A point that I’ll ask Dr. Birx to expand on in just a moment is the fact that, beyond the new 15-minute test by Abbott Laboratories, beyond what we expect to be a new antibody test, which may well be approved by the FDA in just a matter of days, and antibody tests that would be produced at the rate of 20 million tests a month."
2020-04-13,01:57:50,Mike Pence,"The reality is that those commercial laboratories that the president brought in here the better part of two months ago and initiated that public and private partnership with have been producing hundreds of thousands of tests every single week. But as a Dr. Birx and our team have apprehended, we believe at this point in time that of the Roche equipment that is out there that does the high speed testing, and we informed governors of this today, we think that some 20% of that capacity is not being used. With regard to the Abbott m2000 systems, we told governors today that we think 75% of that laboratory capacity that exists in the United States today is not being utilized by our governors."
2020-04-13,01:58:43,Mike Pence,"We sent a very clear message to governors today to reach out to their hospitals, reach out to their labs, to identify the presence of the Roche Amplicore 500 and the Abbott m2000 to get those activated. We literally estimate that, although we’re doing over 110,000 tests a day in the United States, that if our governors and state labs would simply activate the machines that are already there, we could double the amount of testing in the United States literally overnight. I know that governors’ teams watch these briefings, and we’ll remind them very respectfully again to identify those labs. We have a team that now is deploying, reaching out to labs to see if we can activate all of those labs."
2020-04-13,01:59:36,Mike Pence,"Secondly, on the subject of supplies, I’ve said it a couple of times from this podium today, but let me say it one more time. President Trump’s direction to us in dealing with the states on personal protective equipment and ventilators has been to make sure the states have what they need when they need it. We recognize that while we all watch the overall curve of the coronavirus in America, understandably the national numbers, the reality is this outbreak has taken place in its own individual curves, first on the West Coast, then the New York City area, then Louisiana, Michigan, and now we continue to contend with it in Chicago and Houston and other metropolitan areas."
2020-04-13,02:00:22,Mike Pence,"It has given us the opportunity to ensure that personal protective equipment and ventilators are made available on a critical basis. I have to tell you, we’re incredibly proud of the effort and the partnership with states that has us standing here today that no one who has required a ventilator has been denied a ventilator in the United States of America. At this point, we have just short of 7,000 ventilators in the strategic national stockpile, but as Admiral Polowczyk will detail, we’re already beginning to receive newly manufactured ventilators. We’ll get another thousand in this week. By the middle of May, we’ll literally have another 8,000 ventilators available for deployment around the country."
2020-04-13,02:01:12,Mike Pence,"I’m going to let him describe to you the specific detailing of those resources, but I want to share these numbers most especially for care workers around the country in the areas most impacted by the coronavirus so that you know the resources are surging into the hospital systems at the point of the need, and we will continue to do just that. Let me recognize a Dr. Birx to reflect on the data and also on maybe some comments on testing, and then, Admiral Polowczyk, can you just step up, and then you’ll describe supplies. We’ll hear from Dr. Fauci again and then take a few questions."
2020-04-13,02:01:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Great. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I don’t know if we can get the first slide on cumulative cases. Yes, thank you so much. I wanted to show you a different way of looking at it today. Obviously, we look at case counts per 100,000 Americans in each of our states and metro areas, but I wanted you to see an absolute numbers how much the New York, New Jersey metro area dwarfs all other metro areas. You can’t even see Chicago, Detroit, or Boston, all of those Metro areas are under 25, 000 cases. You can see that the New York, New Jersey metro area is about almost 250,000 when you bring those cases together almost, a lot more. That’s why you hear us talking a lot about the metro area of New York and New Jersey and the counties of Rockland and Westchester and Suffolk and not Nassau and Bergen, New Jersey, and why we’re so focused on getting resources to that metro area."
2020-04-13,02:02:58,Dr. Deborah Birx,"If I can see the next slide then. If I take New York and New Jersey metro area out, this is the other metro areas that we have been tracking very closely. I wanted to show this to you so that you could see how those curves are already starting to plateau. If you look at Detroit, if you look at Philadelphia, if you look at Louisiana. Louisiana’s in green. Detroit is in gray. You can see across the board, across these metro areas, across metro areas which have a higher concentration of individuals, this is what the American people in these large cities have done, where it is more difficult often to socially distance. We’re just really impressed by the work of the mayors and the governors to make this happen. I also wanted you to see this, because you can clearly see Chicago and Boston. Chicago is in the orange and Boston is in the yellow. They’re crossing Detroit, and that’s why we have been very much focused on the needs of those areas. Providence is also in that category. It’s difficult for them to you to see them because they’re a much further down on the slide."
2020-04-13,02:04:12,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But the highest, if you look at the axis on this slide, it’s 25,000. The axis on the last slide was 300,000, so that’s why I really want people to understand each of these small epidemics in each of the metro areas we’re tracking independently as well as epidemics and outbreaks that are happening in some of our other States. I just wanted you to have that perspective of how significant the New York/New Jersey issue is and why we’ve been tracking that so closely, but I also wanted to assure all the other States that were tracking them also very closely and really working with the governors and mayors. That’s why I wanted you to just see that not only are the curves flattening in some of those major metropolitan areas, but they’re starting to decrease. This is what we’re very excited about. These are cases we also know that mortality will lag, so we’re really tracking also the number of individuals who have succumbed to the COVID-19."
2020-04-13,02:05:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I also wanted to really note here that, yes, our mortality is less when you combine European countries equal to the size of the United States, and I think this is really two things. One, it’s the incredible work of the American people, but it’s also the incredible work of our healthcare providers and the system of each of these hospitals that have the resources and the ability to respond to the needs of the COVID-19 patients. I think you can really see the superb healthcare delivery that is happening by the low mortality."
2020-04-13,02:05:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Just to mention really quickly about testing, because you’ve heard me before talk about it, and then it was a little bit misquoted and misaligned, but there are multiple Abbott machines. I’m going to be very clear, having spent years in the laboratory. The high throughput machines, which are the Roche 6800, and I think it’s the 8800 on Roche, and the Abbott m2000, these are the machines that run between 500 and a thousand assays at a time. The Abbott company worked really hard three weeks ago and getting a million tests out there to be utilized, and they can make a million tests a week for all of our laboratories that have these platforms. So far to date, somewhere around 250,000 tests have been utilized in three weeks worth of work. That’s why we’ve really been appealing to the laboratory directors to really bring all those machines on."
2020-04-13,02:06:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Last week, Dr. Fauci and his incredible team of researchers have agreed to really reach out and find additional Roche and Abbott high throughput machines that are in research institutions and doing critical research work to bring them online also to supplement the other laboratories’ work to create a mosaic and a complete strategy that brings together the high throughput platforms with the medium throughput platforms with what are the low throughput but rapid platforms, which is this ID NOW. ID NOW is not going to be the answer to the number of tests that we need over the next few weeks. Those run a test every 15 minutes, and we can get about 55,000 cartridges a day. But I just got done saying that these other machines, of which we have hundreds of, can run 500 to a thousand in a single timeframe. We need to bring all of these assays together, and a team has been created to call every single laboratory and every single research institution across the United States to define the complete capacity in every …"
2020-04-13,02:08:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Across the United States to define the complete capacity in every single state because it shouldn’t be our expectation that every governor understands exactly everything that’s in his state. But we have to understand everything and every state in order to be able to meet the needs of the American people as we increase testing. Now I know you all know that in three weeks we went from 300,000 tests total to 3 million tests total in three weeks. We know that we have to further increase that. That has been done really by HHS and Admiral Gerard and the team up there and we’re going to supplement that team to really bring on all of the additional resources and platforms that we have in the United States of America. Just like we did with ventilators to bring all of the capacity to bear so that we can also continue to increase testing."
2020-04-13,02:08:53,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Also of course as these epidemics decrease, you can also be able to use more and more testing for surveillance. But I do want to call out the 19 States that aren’t ever represented in these graphics. And by and large the States have been Kenyon to do containment and outbreak investigation. And I’ve been able to talk to many of those States and I would just remind all of us when I talked to each one of these state health officials where they are finding outbreaks are in nursing homes. And so we really need to continue to protect and we continue to test in nursing homes because we know that that’s a particularly vulnerable group and it’s a group where often now that we’re beginning to understand asymptomatic transmission, no one is intending to pass the virus on to others. But we know in essential workers around the United States, people are unknowingly infected and then passing the virus on."
2020-04-13,02:09:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so those are the ones that we’re very interested in finding. And you might say, “Well how do you find them because they don’t have symptoms?” And so this is where we really have to increase surveillance in a very deliberative and understand way. And so we’re really looking what are Sentinel surveillance sites? I think we can see where there’s outbreaks because once people have symptoms you can see them, but where do you do Sentinel surveillance so that you find them before they have symptoms? This is what we have done for decades in HIV and it’s what’s allowing us right now to really control the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Subsaharan Africa because we’re finding people when they’re asymptomatic and treating them when they’re asymptomatic. So this is something we know how to do and it’s something we’re working very closely with CDC and others on to make sure that we can bring that full capacity to the American people."
2020-04-13,02:10:41,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So these are just some insights and what we’re working on. We’re continuing obviously to track every single County and community. And then finally I’m going to call on one additional group. There’s a group out there of our HIV/AIDS activists and community workers that understand these tests that I have been talking about, these RNA based test. Because they often get viral loads in HIV, but they will know how to explain this to the community about sampling and what it means to run those assays. They are essentially virologists. They understand all of these assays. They also understand the antibody assays because it’s the antibody assays that they cancel and utilize in HIV testing across the United States. And they will be our translator to the American public and to their local mayors. They understand these tests, they essentially understand all the virology and all the immunology and I’m really asking all of them to help us communicate what these tests are so the community is ready for them. Because antibody tests measure something very different than the viral load in the front of your nose that we’re using for diagnosis. And so really being able to understand all of those tests, when to use them, how to use them will be really critical. But the great thing is in the United States of America, we have these community groups that understand these tests very well and we’ll be able to discuss them at every level with their community."
2020-04-13,02:12:07,Mike Pence,"Great. I’m going to call in [inaudible 02:12:11] up in a minute, but I have to call on Dr. Tony Fauci and let me just say something really straight from my heart if I can. I lost my dad 32 years ago today. April 13th is always a tough day for our family. And this morning when my brothers and sisters were sending around pictures of dad like we always do, I just thought of the families of the more than 22,000 Americans that we’ve lost. And I just want to tell you that you’re on our hearts and you’re in the prayers of millions of Americans as you deal with this heart breaking loss. As well as families that have family members that are struggling with serious illness. But let me just encourage everyone that in the midst of that loss because the American people have been putting these mitigation measures into practice there are families that are still together today."
2020-04-13,02:13:21,Mike Pence,"And I just want to encourage you here at roughly the halfway point of 30 days to slow the spread, to take that to heart. In no way minimize the losses that we’ve experienced as a nation and as families but to be encouraged to know when you see those numbers on the vast majority of States that because of what the American people are doing, it’s working. And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and the entire team continually ask us to remind the American people and we do so again today, keep doing what you’re doing with the 30 days to slow the spread and we will hasten the day that we heal our land. Dr Fauci."
2020-04-13,02:14:09,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I just want to make one comment that related to a question that was asked and then we’ll have questions. I don’t want to take too much time. The idea about how we would evaluate from a purely public health standpoint about what I call reentry into some sort of normality as health people I don’t know anything about nor do I have a claim to know anything about economics. They’re going to be people that know a lot more than I do who are going to give advice about all of the committees that the president was talking about. But the one thing we do know as health people, as physicians and scientists and public health people, as I mentioned I think over the weekend on one of the shows is that some people may think it’s going to be like a light switch on and off, we’re either out and we’re in."
2020-04-13,02:14:57,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"It’s just not going to be that way because we have a very large country and there are different impacts, as you see New York is very different from other parts of the country, from the Midwest, from the mountain region, California and Washington different than new Orleans. So as we discuss and consider the public health aspects, it likely would be something that I refer to as sort of like a rolling re-entry. It’s not going to be one size fits all. So I don’t know what it’s going to be yet because we still have time to look at it. Dr Birx, who does an amazing job with showing you the data and the charts that’s going to likely influence some of the recommendations that we will make. But I can assure you there will be recommendations that we’ve based purely on public health and the president will get a lot of other input from others, but we’ll give the honest public health recommendation."
2020-04-13,02:15:49,Mike Pence,Thank you Tony. Have Admiral Polowczyk get an update on supplies and then we’ll take a few questions.
2020-04-13,02:15:58,John Polowczyk,"Thank you Mr vice president. Can I have the ventilator slide back up and just stop there right, thank you. So you start with what’s in the stockpile this morning and then here’s the contract that we’ll be delivering over the next few weeks. We had 8,600 ventilators to the pool we already have. That’s the math that you get there. That’s included the DPA action with GM and we’ll say that we’ve also issued what would be called rated orders with all of these vendors to allow them front of the line privileges so to speak within their supply chain. So there’s written the contract, this is the a hundred thousand plus families we were talking about and they continue to work with them too ensure that the ventilators actually show up. So those continue to work there. And as we did that, we realized that downstream supply chains needed some additional defense production act work as well."
2020-04-13,02:16:59,John Polowczyk,"You go out to the air bridge, eight flight’s scheduled, 37 complete, 43 on the horizon and you could see the numbers of material that’s been brought in to supplement the volume that’s that’s needed. I’m going to go through a series of slides of New York first. Dr. Birx provides me what I would call as a geographic reference to align the supply chain. So all of those cities, you’ll see a little bit of a theme here. I’ll be talking about a lot of the cities and geographic areas. I align the supply chain to those geographic areas to try to get as much there while realize the rest of the nation needs supplies as well. And then we aligned the supply chain to site of care, public hospitals, VA private hospitals, nursing homes, first responders, acute care and on down the line. So the last business week, so Monday of last week through Friday, Saturday of the past week, these are the mass materials that came into the New York, New Jersey Metro area. And you could see the volumes there."
2020-04-13,02:18:22,John Polowczyk,"So you can go to Detroit. We talked about their hotspot, here’s the volumes of deliveries going into Detroit for that same time period. You can go to Chicago and I’m going to run through this kind of quick, but you can see that the geographic alignment, the places that Dr. Birx has talked about is where we’re concentrating supplies. You can go to New Orleans to give you an understanding. Washington DC all right so Joe Nan talked about that. Today was a very kind of early entry into the Washington DC, Baltimore, positioning supplies ahead of need we hope in Washington. Go to Baltimore and you could see the volumes there are trying to get ahead of that and it ended up. Philadelphia’s next."
2020-04-13,02:19:21,John Polowczyk,"And then now the next slide is a nine city roll up. And so to save a little time, I did not include Boston and Houston in there. So you could see the volume of material flowing through a commercial network, Airbridge, their supplies and the geographic regions and then further prioritize to site of care. Now final topic, N95 masks so the department of defense announced a DPA action this weekend that came over from DOD on Friday into the white house approved on Saturday and contract awarded today 131,000,000 five companies 3M, Honeywell [inaudible 02:20:16] and Drager. The cares act was signed before March was ending or towards the end their, so essentially two weeks from that money being put in the title three authority for DOD. This action takes us from a baseline of what was being produced domestically of about 30 million masks upwards to as we go through the fall into the end of the winter, 120 million masks domestically."
2020-04-13,02:20:51,John Polowczyk,"So currently we’re filling some of that demand from overseas sources. And so the additive masks here through this will ramp up lower dependence on oversee sources and that will essentially secure a big piece of the supply chain. Five companies, six cities, Smithfield, Rhode Island, Phoenix Arizona, Del Rio Texas, Lexington, North Carolina, Sheboygan falls, Wisconsin and Aberdeen North Dakota, all either producing more fabric or increasing production facilities to have that ramp up."
2020-04-13,02:21:40,Mike Pence,"All right, great job. Thank you Admiral and can we put that slide, I guess it’s still up. This is for just the week ending April 11. We have distributed or directed the distribution of 5.3 million N95 masks, 5.5 million surgical masks, 110 million gloves. We share that mostly just to make sure our healthcare workers know that the resources are flowing. We’re going to continue to flow them, but this is just the numbers for this week. And don’t include for instance what the president announced. I was able to tell governor Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania today that next week they’ll be receiving two million N95 masks to support some of the healthcare challenges that they’re facing in the broader Philadelphia area. So with that we’ll be happy to take a couple of questions. Go ahead."
2020-04-13,02:22:44,Unnamed,"Thank you so much. One for the Admiral and then one for Dr. Fauci if you don’t mind. For the Admiral, wouldn’t it have been useful as you’re going through all of those supplies that are now making their way into the system you talked about having to buy foreign products as we’re catching up and making it. Wouldn’t it have been useful if it hadn’t taken until mid March for the government to start placing bulk orders for these kinds of supplies?"
2020-04-13,02:23:06,John Polowczyk,"I came over from the Pentagon 20th of March, so I’ll speak from the 20th March on now. We’re using the defense production act. I think you’ll see a much more use of that as we go forward. You know we make-"
2020-04-13,02:23:18,Unnamed,My question is about the time in here [crosstalk 00:15:20].
2020-04-13,02:23:21,John Polowczyk,I’m not equipped to talk about other than from about the 20th of March forward. I was over at the joint staff I wasn’t [inaudible 02:23:29].
2020-04-13,02:23:29,Unnamed,"I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci, you said that you’d be giving the president your recommendations, you and Dr. Birx coming up with a plan that you guys are comfortable with. Once the president has made his decision, are you willing to come here and tell us, tell the American public what you actually had recommended to him and whether he followed through with what you recommended?"
2020-04-13,02:23:52,Dr. Anthony Fauci,What do you mean?
2020-04-13,02:23:58,Unnamed,"So when the president stands up here, whether it’s May 1st whatever day it is and outlines his plan, are you willing to stand up here after him and tell us all, tell the American public what it was that you had recommended he do if there is a difference?"
2020-04-13,02:24:14,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I have to think about that because when you have conversations with the president, sometimes they really should be confidential and what you give him because he’s going to have to make his own choice. I have to think about that."
2020-04-13,02:24:28,Unnamed,So that we would know whether he was actually listening to the health advice that he’s being provided.
2020-04-13,02:24:34,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"He is, I mean I can tell you one thing, he’ll listen, but I think what’s going to happen, I don’t know for sure is that he will get input from a number of individuals representing a number of aspects of society. One of them will be health. The only thing that I can tell you is that I will give him the advice based on evidence. My observation of what the best public health approach would be."
2020-04-13,02:24:59,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci just to go back to where we started today, which was with the president seeming frustrations with some of the reporting about his early decision making process in January and February. As I’m sure you know, the reason we in the press do that kind of reporting is so that the next president that comes along that has to deal with a pandemic learn some of those lessons. Having watched this unfold up close, what do you think were the mistakes that were made early on that a future president could learn from? What would the benefit of hindsight of course? There’s no [inaudible 02:25:39] against you know obviously, I understand."
2020-04-13,02:25:42,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I don’t want to use the word mistakes because when you’re in the fog of war when you’re doing something, you have to make decisions, you get input from a number of individuals. It’s always a moving target and I just don’t want to have anything taken out of context because I already had one of those already in the last couple of days, so I don’t want to go through it again. I wouldn’t say mistake could things have done better, of course. I mean nothing is perfect and you could always do better. But I mean, I hesitate to say something is a mistake."
2020-04-13,02:26:16,Unnamed,"With the benefit of hindsight that with that caveat, what could have been done better?"
2020-04-13,02:26:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, I mean I can’t comment about anything outside of my own field, but the thing that when I think back on was evolving in my mind was something that was a virus that was much worse than what I had thought it was going to be based on what we had learned early on when it was first felt to be something that just jumped from an animal to a human and really didn’t have much capability of going human to human. And then all of a sudden you find out that not only was it not just animal to human, that’s probably the way it started, but then as you go back and you realize there were probably a lot of infections that maybe if we had dealt into that a little bit more, we could have learned that not only is it affecting human to human, but it’s transmitting really efficiently."
2020-04-13,02:27:21,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"When I question myself, I’m not perfect. Maybe I, I wouldn’t say made mistakes, but maybe I should have really tried to delve into that a little bit more about what was going on, but the information wasn’t as forthcoming as I would have liked. And then all of a sudden when you find out that you’re dealing with something that is not only what had been your worst nightmare, because people ask me that, what is your worst nightmare? A brand new virus that’s respiratory transmitted that has a high degree of transmissibilities that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality. You know, is that a mistake? Maybe I should have been able to realize that earlier, I’m not sure it’s a mistake. It was just an evolving thing that we finally realized and said, “Whoa, this is really worse than we could have imagined.”"
2020-04-13,02:28:11,Unnamed,All right last one guys.
2020-04-13,02:28:11,Mike Pence,One more.
2020-04-13,02:28:12,Unnamed,[inaudible 02:28:12] you’ve met whenever Abbott laboratories. What did you ask them to do? What did they say they could do?
2020-04-13,02:28:21,Mike Pence,"Well we spoke with Abbott laboratories today about how we can increase significantly the production of cartridges for the 15 minute test. Because remember we’re not only scaling to rapidly expand testing across the country today. And it’s one of the reasons why you heard me and Dr. Birx say that we have an entire team now that’s going to be working with governors and with laboratories around the country to identify the machines that already exist today and that could be activated and doing tests. But we also want to work with Abbott laboratories for the longer term because if the current trend lines hold and I hope and I literally pray that we will soon find ourselves on the down slope of the coronavirus in this country. This epidemic in its current form will come to an end, but as we make decisions and in the days ahead to reopen America what president Trump also wants to do is have a policy in place to stay open."
2020-04-13,02:29:33,Mike Pence,"And having the kind of surveillance testing available around the country so that CDC can do the immediate contact tracing when you have a positive test so that we can deploy resources like the new Abbott 15 minute test specifically to nursing homes. We spoke today to governor Baker in Massachusetts, governor Hogan in Maryland, both of whom have been very innovative implementing federal guidelines for preventing the spread of infectious disease at nursing homes. And we commend them for that, but being able to increase the manufacture of those devices so they can be deployed going forward in the months ahead is also a focal point of our efforts. So rapidly continuing to expand testing today and the governor of Louisiana told me today that they have tested at the highest per capita according to his numbers of any state in the union. We congratulate him for that, but making sure that going forward we’ll have the infrastructure of testing all across America to deal with the coronavirus should it return in the future. With that, let me bid you all a good evening. We will be back tomorrow."
2020-04-13,02:30:48,Unnamed,"Vice president have still a question about these cartridges and this timeline because the New Hampshire governor says the federal government is in charge of distributing those, FEMA is. So what is the timeline for when they’ll have enough of them? Because they said that they’ll end up Illinois but they didn’t have enough, so what’s the timeline that you’re working with?"
2020-04-13,02:31:04,Mike Pence,"Yeah, let me let Dr. Birx address that. But there was an initial traunch that we purchased. There’s some 18,000 Abbott laboratory machines around the country. And FEMA acquired a certain amount that were immediately distributed across the states, but now Abbott laboratories is literally producing some 50,000 a day. Those are available on the open market and we’re also going to be working with Abbott and with the states to deploy those resources. And we’re also working with other manufacturers to increase the production of cartridges. But if there’s more to that do you want to add [inaudible 02:31:45]."
2020-04-13,02:31:45,Dr. Deborah Birx,"No that was perfectly said. You ask these questions and I just want to make sure that people understand. So a third of them went specifically to Indian health service and in these states that have smaller epidemics. Two thirds of it went into the public market, mostly targeted to the places where there’s high disease. But only two thirds one that way so that people could purchase them directly and one third went to the Indian health service and to the smaller states that really need these. And so I think what we’re trying to do now is balance the entire testing framework of medium low and high throughput machines to give everyone the maximum flexibility state by state based on what the needs are at that moment."
2020-04-13,02:32:35,Dr. Deborah Birx,"If there’s an outbreak and you have to do 5,000 tasks, you’re not going to do them on an ID mat now machine that takes 15 minutes for every negative, but you’re going to do it on your high throughput machine. So making sure everybody knows where everything is and what is being run will be really critical moving forward because we can’t leave anything not on, everything has to be on the table in order for us to be able to dramatically increase testing yet another. We went up by a log in three weeks, so if we’re going to increase again, it’s going to have to be getting every piece of equipment on."
2020-04-13,02:33:10,Mike Pence,"Let me just again say thank you all for your time and attention and thanks to every American who’s joined us tonight. I just want to encourage you, we’re going to continue to lean into this effort to expand testing across the country to deploy supplies to our incredible healthcare workers that have done such an amazing job in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic. But my last word on behalf of the president and on behalf of our entire task force is 30 days to slow the spread. And I know we’re almost at the halfway point and I know it’s been a month of these mitigation strategies. But I hope as you look on, as you see the progress that’s made on the West coast, the beginnings of real progress in the greater New York city area, Louisiana, Detroit and elsewhere. I hope it will only still your resolve to continue to do your part to slow the spread. Because we’ll get through this, but it’ll take all of us to continue to do it. So thank you the American people for all your efforts and we’ll see you tomorrow."
2020-04-14,00:03,Donald Trump,"Very importantly, I’d like to begin by saying that we’ve just reached an agreement, the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, with the major airlines, all of our great airlines, to participate in a payroll support program. This agreement will fully support airline industry workers, preserve the vital role airlines play in our economy and protect taxpayers. Our airlines are now in good shape. And they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them. The United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus. We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness we can see the rays of light. We see that tunnel, and at the end of that tunnel, we see light. We’re starting to see it more than ever before. We’ve held our rate, the numbers, everything we’ve done. We’ve been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it."
2020-04-14,01:16,Donald Trump,"You look at what’s happening in other countries, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, we’re working with them. We’re trying to help them, especially with ventilators. They’ve been calling a lot. They need ventilators so badly. 15% of counties within the United States have zero cases, and many counties within the United States have a very small number of cases. Large sections of our country are really looking at other sections and saying, “Wow, that looks bad.” But they don’t have the problem. I salute the American people for following our guidelines on social distancing, even you people are so different looking out there, when I look at you. Their devotion, your devotion is saving lives. Today, I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus. Everybody knows what’s going on there."
2020-04-14,02:24,Donald Trump,"American taxpayers provide between 400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO. In contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year. And even less as the organization’s leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability, one of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations. They were very much opposed to what we did. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives. Thousands and thousands of people would have died. Had other nations likewise suspended travel from China, countless more lives would have been saved. Instead, look at the rest of the world. Look at parts of Europe. Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world. Many countries said, “We’re going to listen to the WHO.” And they have problems the likes of which they cannot believe."
2020-04-14,03:43,Donald Trump,"Nobody can believe. The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO’s attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures. Travel bands work for the same reason that quarantines work. Pandemics depend on human-to-human transmission. Border control is fundamental to virus control. Since its establishment in 1948, the American people have generously supported the World Health Organization to provide better health outcomes for the world, and most importantly to help prevent global health crises. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America’s generosity has been put to the best use possible. The reality is that the WHO fail to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion. The world depends on the WHO to work with countries to ensure that accurate information about international health threats is shared in a timely manner, and if it’s not to independently tell the world the truth about what is happening."
2020-04-14,05:08,Donald Trump,"The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable. It’s time after all of these decades. The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan, that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts. There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December, 2019, which should have speared the WHO to investigate and investigate immediately. Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary."
2020-04-14,05:53,Donald Trump,"The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency cost valuable time, tremendous amounts of time. More time was lost in the delay it took to get a team of international experts into examine the outbreak, which we wanted to do, which they should have done. The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples to this date has deprived the scientific community of essential data. New data that emerges across the world on a daily basis, points to the unreliability of the initial reports. And the world received all sorts of false information about transmission and mortality."
2020-04-14,06:47,Donald Trump,"The silence of the WHO on the disappearance of scientific researchers and doctors, and our new restrictions on the sharing of research into the origins of COVID- 19, and the country of origin, is deeply concerning. Especially when we put up by far the largest amount of money. Not even close. Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China’s lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death, very little death, and certainly very little death by comparison. This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China’s assurances to face value and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising China for its so-called transparency."
2020-04-14,07:55,Donald Trump,"I don’t think so. The WHO pushed China’s misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bands. They told us when we put on our travel ban, a very strong travel ban, there was no need to do it. Don’t do it. They actually fought us. The WHO’s reliance on China’s disclosures likely caused a 20 fold increase in cases worldwide, and it may be much more than that. The WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many. America and the world have chosen to rely on the WHO for accurate, timely, and independent information to make important public health recommendations and decisions. If we cannot trust that this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals. We’ll have no choice but to do that."
2020-04-14,09:06,Donald Trump,"Our countries are now experiencing, you look all over the world, tremendous death and economic devastation, because those tasked with protecting us by being truthful and transparent failed to do so. It would have been so easy to be truthful. And so much death has been caused by their mistakes. We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms. For the time being, we will redirect global health and directly work with others. All of the aid that we send will be discussed at very, very powerful letters and with very powerful and influential groups and smart groups, medically, politically and every other way. And we’ll be discussing it with other countries and global health partners. What we do with all of that money that goes to WHO, and maybe WHO will reform, and maybe they won’t, but we’ll be able to see."
2020-04-14,10:20,Donald Trump,"As you know, in other countries, hit hard by the virus, hospitals have been tragically forced to ration medical care and the use of ventilators, but due to our early and aggressive action, the skill of our healthcare workers, and the resilience of our healthcare system, no hospital in America has been forced to deny any patient access to a ventilator. With all of the talk you’ve heard, where some states wanted 40,000 ventilators. I said, “That doesn’t work. 40,000.” And they ended up with seven or 8,000. And they had no problem. 40,000 ventilators for one state. It was ridiculous. The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators."
2020-04-14,11:23,Donald Trump,"That we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators. This is the system we inherited. I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have. And you look at the states, the states didn’t have, the states were not prepared. I knew that every person who needed a ventilator and didn’t get one would die. And that’s what we were told. They would die. I saw another country’s doctors having to make decisions on who got a ventilator and who didn’t. And I knew that this would be a defining challenge of the crisis. Those that didn’t get ventilators were said to be in a position, only of one alternative, and that was death."
2020-04-14,12:17,Donald Trump,"Would we be able to prevent Americans from dying because we couldn’t get them ventilators, and the ventilators that they needed and they needed immediately. I instructed my team to move heaven and earth to make sure that this didn’t happen. We started to smartly ration and distribute the ventilators that we had and that others had. And I got daily updates on the supply we had, from requests coming in and people wanting to have updates. We had a great group of people working on it. I instructed my team to use the Defense Protection Act."
2020-04-14,12:58,Donald Trump,"And the Defense Production Act was used very powerfully, more powerfully than anybody would know. In fact, so powerfully that for the most part, we didn’t have to officially take it out. It was a hammer. It was a very powerful hammer, in order to manufacture as many ventilators as possible. Last year, America manufactured from a dead start, 30,000 ventilators. And this year the number will be over 150,000 ventilators. It could be as high as 200,000. Far more than we’ll ever need. So we’ll be able to stockpile, we’ll be able to talk to states about stockpiling. These are high quality ventilators. We had a choice. We could do inexpensive, less productive ventilators or high quality. We’ve done a high quality ventilator, so we should have anywhere from 150 to 200,000 ventilators."
2020-04-14,13:58,Donald Trump,"In addition to that, we have 10, 000 ventilators right now in the federal stockpile ready to move, should we need them. We might not. Should we need them in New York, or New Jersey, or in Louisiana, or in Illinois, or any other state that may need them, if we have a surge. I’d like to ask Adam Bowler to come up and just say a few words. He’s done a fantastic job. A young man who worked 24 hours a day on handling this situation. And I’d just like to have Adam, wherever he may be, come up and say a few words. Adam, please. Thank you very much."
2020-04-14,14:41,Adam Boehler,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. At your direction, this country has worked hard over the past few weeks to ramp up ventilator production through all means possible. Thousands of ventilators are coming in now monthly, with over 100,000 by the end of June. At the same time, there are over 60,000 ventilators in our hospitals right now that are not in use. Knowing this and at your direction, we reached out to the American Hospital Association to design a system that allows hospitals to lend ventilators to other hospitals right when they need it. Within the past week alone, 20 top health systems have signed up for this dynamic ventilator reserve representing over 4,000 ventilators. Not only do we have top academic systems, like Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic, but we also have top health systems from New York City, New Orleans, Washington State, and California. Over a week ago, these places would have needed help, but now they are here to help."
2020-04-14,15:47,Adam Boehler,"There’s been no American that has needed a ventilator that has not received one. This dynamic virtual reserve, combined with our strategic stockpile, will ensure that this is always the case. I’d like to thank the president for his leadership and directive to focus on public private partnerships like this one. I’d also like to thank Sam Hazen from HCA, Lloyd Dean from Common Spirit, for leading this effort with the AHA and the Federation of American Hospitals. These have been difficult times. A few weeks ago, the Vice President came into my office and he reminded us of the power of the resilience of the American people and of private companies. We needed it that day, Mr. Vice President. This partnership is another example of Americans helping Americans. Thank you."
2020-04-14,16:41,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Fantastic.
2020-04-14,16:43,Adam Boehler,"Thank you, sir."
2020-04-14,16:45,Donald Trump,"I’d shake his hand, but I’m not allowed to. Times have changed, haven’t they? Thank you very much. You did a fantastic job. We’re very proud of you and your whole team. Thank you. Today, we are taking further action to maximize our oversupply and available-"
2020-04-14,17:03,Donald Trump,"… to maximize our oversupply in available ventilators. This afternoon I met with the leaders, the top people of many of America’s big, powerful, beautiful and very, very important hospitals and hospital associations who join us today. We had a great meeting, learned a lot, and they’ve been going through a lot. They’ve been doing a fantastic job as everybody here will attest. I’m pleased to announce that my administration is partnering with the hospitals across the country to create an innovative new system called the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve so that we’re going to have tremendous numbers of ventilators that we’re able to help our states with at a later date. If there’s ever a problem like this, which we hope to God will never happen again. It was 1917, 1918, that’s a long time ago. We hope it never happens again. And I’d like to ask Rick Pollock, CEO of American Hospital Association, Sam Hazen, CEO of HCA Healthcare, it’s the largest in the United States, Warner Thomas, CEO of Oschner Health, and if I could, Ami Hall. Are you here from Cleveland Clinic? Somebody? Good, thank you. Come on up, [Faulx 00:00:18:25], please. Thank you. Say a few words."
2020-04-14,18:32,Ami Hall,"Thank you very much Mr. President. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your team on the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve Program. This will provide a really important mechanism for us in serving our patients and communities by ensuring that this vital equipment will be available to critical areas that are in need. As this battle against this disease has affected the country a little bit unevenly, the rates of infection, hospitalization and ICU use varies from one region to another. In some places with lower infection rates some ventilators may not be in use while other areas are potentially stretched beyond their capacity. The database of available ventilators that we are creating will allow us to flex so that we can make sure that available equipment can be shared with those in need."
2020-04-14,19:28,Ami Hall,"We appreciate the leadership of the health systems that are here today that has stepped forward and Adam mentioned a few, I don’t know if he caught Dr. Fritz Francoise from NYU Langone and David Dill, the CEO of LifePoint as well. We appreciate the work of the administration in helping us find innovative solutions to ensure the best care for our patients. We’ll continue to work with hospitals and health systems across the country to add to this reserve further. Your team has provided us with important leadership and we look forward to working with you in making this a success. Thank you Mr. President."
2020-04-14,20:04,Donald Trump,Thank you very much.
2020-04-14,20:08,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Adam, the team. I stand here before you in front of our 285,000 colleagues who provide care to patients every day across the country. One of the guiding principles we had when we went into this COVID-19 battle was to find partnerships, partnerships with other components of the industry, partnerships with other health systems, but partnerships with governments, both local and federal and we’re proud to be a part of this private-public sector partnership and I think it’s going to do great good for the community. So thank you very much."
2020-04-14,20:42,Donald Trump,Great job. Thank you [inaudible 00:20:43].
2020-04-14,20:48,Oschner Health Representative,"Thank you Mr. President. It’s great to have Oschner Health be part of this program. We certainly have been a recipient and the State of Louisiana has been a recipient of help getting ventilators to our state and to Ochsner Health. We’re currently taking care of about 60% of the Covid patients in New Orleans and we did see a spike over the past few weeks, but we’re starting to get on the other side of that and heading in the right direction. I also want to thank you personally for helping Ochsner Health. A couple of weeks ago we were running short on surgical gowns and you and your team were able to direct some to New Orleans, which was helpful to us and other hospitals around the New Orleans area. So we’re excited to be part of this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve and we are proud to be a part of that and help other communities around the country. Thank you."
2020-04-14,21:38,Cleveland Clinic Representative,"Thank you Mr. President for the invitation here. On behalf of the Cleveland Clinic, I would just like to offer a slightly different story about a Covid pandemic. In our home state of Ohio, we did an early institution of a social distancing. Our ability to scale up the testing and ramping out the capacity, we have actually seen a stable number of patients over the last 8 to 10 days. Only 160 patients have been hospitalized with Covid infection in Cleveland Clinic Health System. We are also very grateful for the support from our state government as well from our federal government. This is a battle where we’re all in together. We coordinate our efforts, share our resources and work together as one. I’m firmly convinced that we can do a lot of good when we work together. Thank you very much for having us. Thank you, sir."
2020-04-14,22:36,Donald Trump,Thank you all. Great job.
2020-04-14,22:36,Donald Trump,"That was a terrific meeting and thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. The United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation. We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain. Think of that, 34.7 we have and 6.6 in the UK. There are more than 60,000 ventilators at hospitals and other healthcare facilities that are not in use at this moment. They didn’t need them. We got a lot of them out and they didn’t need them and that’s a good thing that they didn’t need them, but a lot of good brain power was involved in making a lot of fantastic decisions. I want to thank our vice president for the task force and I want to thank all members of your task force on having done an incredible job. You really have done an incredible job. Thank you Mike very much."
2020-04-14,23:41,Donald Trump,"Through this new partnership with the hospitals, where they have unused ventilators they will voluntary lend those ventilators to other hospitals and other areas of greater need. Within the last several days, more than 20 of our nation’s largest health systems have already pledged more than 4,000 ventilators should we need them, and I have been told that if they need more, there are more there. We’re going to be helping very soon when the supply really starts pouring in, which started but will really start in about less than a month. We’re going to be helping other countries and they need it very badly. They have no chance without these ventilators. They have to have ventilators."
2020-04-14,24:35,Donald Trump,"As we continue our medical war against the virus, the FDA has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients. The first one. These tests can be self administered by patients in healthcare settings, which will reduce exposure for medical workers and save personal protective equipment. Rutgers will begin processing 10,000 tests daily. So by using saliva, that’s a first, they’ll be able to do things in terms of speed and ease that we haven’t been able to do before. So a lot of great innovation is taking place during this period of time and that’s innovation, I call it innovation under pressure. There’s a big difference. Innovation under pressure, right? Cleveland Clinic knows all about that."
2020-04-14,25:28,Donald Trump,"As we prepare for the next phase of this great struggle, we must also do everything in our power to restore prosperity for the American worker. There’s tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the administration’s efforts to get the economy roaring once again, and I think it’s going to roar once it gets open. I think it’s going to go up tremendously. You see what’s happening with the stock market already because a lot of the very smart financial people, the great minds, they’re looking at the stock and they’re saying, “Wow,” because what they’re really seeing is how we’re doing. If we weren’t doing well, the market wouldn’t be at a level that it is today. They have a lot of confidence that we’re doing the right thing and that our country’s going to be open soon and our country’s going to be booming."
2020-04-14,26:18,Donald Trump,"We’ve had requests to participate from the best in the world as we share their enthusiasm to get our country going. So I thank them for wanting to contribute and we look forward to speaking with many industry leaders seeking their input on how we can return to what was until very recently the greatest economy anywhere in the world. And I can say the greatest economy in the history of the world, there’s never been an economy like we had just a little bit more than a month ago. We set every record you could set. More people working than we’ve ever had working before, almost 160 million. The best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had and the best employment numbers we’ve ever had. Everybody was doing well. Stock market at a record, 142 days it hit a record and I think we’re going to top those records. Okay? And I think we’re going to top them soon once we get rid of the invisible enemy, which will happen."
2020-04-14,27:20,Donald Trump,"The plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody. I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly and I will then be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state at a time and in a manner as most appropriate. The day will be very close because certain states, as you know, are in much different condition and in a much different place than other states. It’s going to be very, very close, maybe even before the date of May 1st. So that will be for some states. Actually, there are over 20 that are in extremely good shape and we think we’re going to be able to get them open fairly quickly and then others will follow."
2020-04-14,28:36,Donald Trump,"The federal government will be watching them very closely and we’ll be there to help. We’ll be there to help in many different ways as we’ve been where we built hospital beds at a number that nobody’s ever seen before, where we did the ventilators that we just discussed at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. Nobody can even believe, other foreign countries, even powerful countries can’t believe what we were able to do with ventilators. Big powerful countries, big producing countries can’t believe what we were able to do. We will hold the governors accountable. But again, we’re going to be working with them to make sure it works really well."
2020-04-14,29:18,Donald Trump,"Now, we have a list of people that I’ll be speaking to over the next very short period of time and in many cases tomorrow. We’re going to have elected officials and we’ll be submitting that list to you within the next 24 hours. But we have a list of different industries that I’ll be discussing by meeting by telephone because we don’t want people traveling right now. The American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall; Cisco Systems; Tyson Foods; Purdue Farms; Cargill; Archer Daniels, Midland Company; Corteva; Tractor Supply Company; Seaboard Corporation; Grimmway Farms; Mountaire Farms and others in the agricultural business. In banking it’s Bank of America. Brian Moynihan has been great. JP Morgan Chase, Jamie Diamond; Goldman Sachs; Citi Group; Wells Fargo; US Bank Corp; Morgan Stanley, James Gorman, Grand Rapids State Bank; Southern Bank Corp, all great institutions with lots to say and lots of good ideas."
2020-04-14,30:37,Donald Trump,"And if you look at how Paycheck has been working out, the numbers are incredible and I hope Congress is going to be able to supplement the amount of money going to our workers. I hope they are able to get that done very quickly because it’s been an incredible success and many are already spending that money and the money’s been distributed at numbers that nobody believed possible for this short period of time. It was only a week ago, but a lot of money has been distributed already. It’s going to keep our small businesses open."
2020-04-14,31:09,Donald Trump,"The Construction Labor Workforce; International Union of Operating Engineers, Jim Callahan; North America Building Trades Union, Sean McGarvey. These are a lot of friends of mine. Labor’s International Union of North America, Terry O’Sullivan; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James Hoffa; National Electrical Contractors Association, David Long; Bechtel Floor, National Association of Home Builders; Association of Builders and Contractors; Associated General Contractors; Richard Trumka, AFL-DIO, GH Palmer. So these are some of the unions, pretty much almost all of the ones that will be on the line."
2020-04-14,31:59,Donald Trump,"In defense we have Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman. These are all the top of each company, CEOs, chairmans, presidents. Raytheon, General Dynamics. Energy, we had a tremendous success recently with energy over the weekend. It finished with a tremendous credit going to Russia and to Saudi Arabia, and it could be as much as 20 million barrels a day a cut so that we can get rid of some of the tremendous excess oil that’s been produced because of the fact that the virus just knocked out almost 50% of the business. It’s been an amazing achievement. Some people say one of the biggest oil deals ever made, maybe the biggest oil deal ever made they’re saying. I didn’t know that, but we were involved in getting that done and it was very important. We’re going to save hundreds of thousands of jobs for our energy industry, Texas and North Dakota, Oklahoma, all of our different energy states. It’s great. So we’re very happy about it. I want to thank everybody. We had the, it’s called OPEC Plus. That’s OPEC Plus, meaning some nations outside of OPEC. And I also want to thank the president of Mexico because he was terrific. He showed great dexterity and flexibility in getting the deal done. We want to thank him very much."
2020-04-14,33:24,Donald Trump,"On the energy front, we had ExxonMobil, Continental Resources, Chevron, Southern Company, Alabama Power, Conoco Phillips, Occidental Petroleum, Kinder Morgan, Pess Corporation, Perot Group, and a few others, big ones, great ones. Financial services we have Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman; Paulson and Company, John Paulson; Citadel, Ken Griffin; Elliot Management, Paul Singer; Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith; Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson; Mas-"

It worked out well for everybody. Proctor and Gamble, Abbott Laboratories, Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Thermo Fisher Scientific."
2020-04-14,36:04,Donald Trump,"They’ve been helping us incredibly with testing. Gilead sciences, Abby Vi, Regeneron, Biogen, Roche. And Roche has been fantastic on testing. The job they’ve done, I have to call them out. They have really … They have stepped up like very few. Anthem, United Health Group, Aetna, Cigna and Humana, all the big ones. The tech companies. We have the right ones. Apple, we have Tim Cook. Google, Sundar. Thank you, Sundar. Oracle, Larry Ellison and Safra Catz. Salesforce, Mark Benenoff. SAP, SAP. Jen Morgan, Microsoft’s Satya. Great job he’s done. Thank you, Satya. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, Cisco, Advanced Micro Devices. Broadcom. Incredible companies, companies that no other country will catch if they’re smart. They have to be smart. But I’ve dealt with a lot of different countries and I will say that no … The respect for Silicon Valley and our tech companies, there’s nobody even close to our tech companies. They can’t catch them, so they try and buy them. But we’ve sort of put an end to a lot of that."
2020-04-14,37:37,Donald Trump,"In sports, we want to get our sports back, so importantly. These will be some separate calls. Some will be together by the wait lists and some will be separate, but we have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old, but I haven’t actually had too much time to watch. I would say maybe I watch one batter and then I get back to work. The NBA, Adam Silver, the Major League Baseball. We miss our base … Well, this is baseball season right here. Rob Manford. Thank you very much. NFL, Roger Goodell. Thank you, Roger. UFC, Dana White. Great Dana White. PGA, Jay Monahan. LPGA, Michael Juan. USDA, Patrick Galbraith. Major League Soccer, Don Garber. WWE, the great Vince McMahon. NASCAR, Lisa Kennedy. Thank you, Lisa. NHL, Gary Bettman. From the New England Patriots, Bob Kraft. Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones. Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. And some of the thought leaders that we’re going to have and there are some others that we are having, we’re just waiting to hear, but everybody is saying yes I must say. John Allison, Heritage Foundation. Kay Coles James, great person. Hoover Institute. Condoleezza Rice, another great person. Art Laffer, Steve Moore, Steve Forbes, Larry Lindsey, Catherine Reynolds, Scott Gottlieb. Just spoke with Scott. Jim Dement and Jim has been terrific friend. Bill Haggerty and Ray Washburn. And religious leaders will be coming on Friday. We’ll be speaking to and we’re going to have a separate list, but we have tremendous enthusiasm to meet by our great religious leaders. We have incredible people and they want to be a part. We’ll be talking about churches and we’ll be talking about opening and we’ll be talking about things that are very important to a lot of people, including me. We’re going to find out how we’re doing in that regard. Those are the names that we have on our list. They’re the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest. They’re going to give us some ideas, but we’re all set, as I said."
2020-04-14,40:14,Donald Trump,"The governors are going to be opening up their states. They’re going to declare when. They’re going to know when. Some can open very, very shortly, if not almost immediately. We’ll give a date, but the date’s going to be in the very near future, so we’ll get it open. Individual states when the governors will be held accountable. If they need things, we’ll help them get those things, but we want them to do their testing. We want them because they’re equipped to do testing. We’ve created incredible test and we’ve done more testing than anybody’s ever done in the world right now and we had a broken system and now we have a great system. We have a system where other countries are coming to us and saying, we want to get some of those tests. I want to thank Abbott because Abbott came up with the first simpler test."
2020-04-14,41:02,Donald Trump,"The first one was rough if you were … I think it was more of an operation than a test. The first one was, for anybody that took it, it was not easy. But now we have a very simple test with Abbott. Now we have saliva. We have lots of other things that are happening, but we have millions of tests. The governors are responsible. They have to take charge. They have to do a great job and we’re going to suggest that they check people through tests or otherwise coming into their states and they run their states very strong. Eventually we won’t have to do that. Eventually this will be gone, but for a while we’re going to do it. They’re going to take charge at their borders. They’re going to take charge of people coming in, and maybe to an extent, depending on what they work out with a nearby state, it may be also people leaving. They’ll be able to do that very shortly. We’ll be announcing a date, but it’ll be very short and frankly it’ll be at a time that will be earlier than the deadline that we imposed, the end of April."
2020-04-14,42:09,Donald Trump,"We think that some of the governors, we’ll be in really good shape to open up even sooner than that. We’ll speak to them, but we’re all set. We’re counting on the governors to do a great job. Others are going to have to take a longer period of time until they’re in a position to say we’re ready to go. And that’s okay. We understand that. Some of the governors have a very tough situation, but in almost all cases it’s all starting to come down. We’re very proud of the job everybody’s done. And if you look at the numbers … So the minimum, as portrayed, Deborah’s here. Dr. Birx has been fantastic. The minimum was 100,000 deaths and I hope to be substantially under the minimum."
2020-04-14,42:55,Donald Trump,"Meaning we all hope, Mike, right? We all hope to be substantially under. We did the right thing because otherwise it would have been … The projections are 2 million people. The actual projection was 2.2 million people and if you cut it in half, that would be 1.1 million people. That’s many more. That’s double the Civil War. And if you cut that in half, you’re talking five or 600,000 people. That’s what we lost in the Civil War. And that’s cutting it, cutting it, cutting it. And we’re not going to … That would not be acceptable. It would not be acceptable. Nothing’s … One life isn’t acceptable, but we weren’t given that option. I’m confident that these respected people that I just read from the list will give us some great ideas in addition to what the governors have learned. The governors have learned a lot. I’ve spoken to governors that at the beginning it was a contentious relationship and now it’s a very friendly relationship and a really great relationship. I’m proud to say that some of them I think are friends."
2020-04-14,44:01,Donald Trump,"In some cases they’re Democrats, but I think they like me and I actually like them. I’ll tell you who they are someday. But we’re all getting along and we all want to do the right thing and I think they’re going to do a great job of leading their individual states. It’ll be a beautiful thing to watch. They’ll go and rely on their mayors and their local town officials. They’ll bring it right down. And Washington shouldn’t be doing that. We can’t be thinking about a Walmart parking lot that’s 2000 miles away where we’re doing testing, but a governor of a state can and a mayor can and right down the line. I think it’s going to be a terrific system and if we’re unhappy with the state, we’re going to let them know we’re unhappy and if they’re not doing the job and they can’t get the job done. And for some reason things are happening that we’re not going to like, like the numbers are heading in a wrong direction, we’ll have to do something that’s very serious."
2020-04-14,44:53,Donald Trump,"We’ll have to maybe close them up and start all over again, but I don’t think we’re going to have to do that. I think the governors are going to come out at a time that … And these will be individual dates and the governors are going to come out at a time when they’re ready. Some can come out very, very shortly and we look forward to watching that process. I think it’s going to be a very beautiful process. Our discussions will focus with the people that we’re dealing with on rejuvenating the economy and always health, always health. Health and life. Living is number one, but the rejuvenated economy and I think it’s going to go quickly. We’ll be utilizing our robust testing capacity for the governors. We’ll be giving them what they need if they don’t have it themselves. We hope by now there’ll be able to have it themselves."
2020-04-14,45:46,Donald Trump,"We were hoping they would have had it themselves early on, but they weren’t, but such great advances have been made. We’ll be dealing with them on that and we, they can rely on us very strongly. They’re going to be relying on us I think for some help and we’re there, whether it’s building hospital beds, which I don’t think they’re going to need. You look at Javits Center, a great, great job that the Army Corps of Engineers did. FEMA got involved. We actually ended up sending our medical people. That was not a COVID 19 center and they asked, could you do that? And then even after we did that, it was not used very much. Meaning they didn’t have to use it nearly to the extent that they thought when they conceived it. It wasn’t that they made a mistake. Nobody made a mistake. We built it."
2020-04-14,46:30,Donald Trump,"I’d rather have too much than too little. Err on the side of caution. It’s really incredible what they did, including the two ships, the two great ships. I just want to thank a lot of really great people, a lot of great politicians. And again, we’re going to be announcing the political list tomorrow. On there we’re going to have a lot of senators and we’re going to be having a meeting with the governor’s probably on Thursday, a meeting by teleconference and a lot of things will be discussed and some of the details will be discussed. But we want them to do an incredible job of running their states. I think they’ll do an incredible job too. After having gotten to know so many of them, I think each one of them will do an incredible job."
2020-04-14,47:17,Donald Trump,"And again, the federal government is there. We have ventilators if they need them. We have beds if they need them. We have hospitals, if they need them. We have a testing capacity that’s now second to none, where again other countries are calling us. Countries that you thought were doing well are calling us for help on testing so we’re there to help. And with that if you have a few questions we’ll take them and if not, that would be okay too. Yeah, go ahead please. Jeff?"
2020-04-14,47:47,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, two questions. First on your announcement about the WHO, I understand your grievances with them, can you address why it is the correct time to do this now in the middle of a pandemic?"
2020-04-14,47:58,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to be dealing with countries and we’re going to be dealing with leaders of different parts of the world. We spend $500 million a year, we have for many years more. Far more than anybody else, including China. I mean look, I read off a long list of problems that we have and we’ve had problems with them for years. It doesn’t matter. We’re looking at a term of 60 to 90 days. We’re doing a very thorough investigation right now as we speak, but this should have been done by previous administrations a long time ago. And when you look at the mistakes that were made, all of the mistakes that were made, it’s just something we have to look at and it is very China centric."
2020-04-14,48:39,Donald Trump,"I told that to President Xi. I said, the World Health Organization is very China centric, meaning whatever it is, China was always right. You can’t do that. Can’t do that. Not right. And we spend, and again, it’s not a question of money, but when we’re spending $500 million and China’s spending $38 million, $34 million, $40 million, $42 million in a case, it’s again, not money, but it’s not right. So we’ll see. This is an evaluation period, but in the meantime we’re putting a hold on all funds going to World Health. We will be able to take that money and channel it to the areas that most need it and that’s another way of doing it. But we have not been treated properly."
2020-04-14,49:27,Unnamed,Mr. President.
2020-04-14,49:27,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-04-14,49:28,Unnamed,"You mentioned that you’re going to speaking with all the governors tomorrow, make recommendations."
2020-04-14,49:33,Donald Trump,Probably Thursday.
2020-04-14,49:34,Unnamed,On Thursday. What if they don’t listen to you or take your advice or obey you? Will you consider taking away their federal funding?
2020-04-14,49:43,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to say that. They’ll listen. They’ll be fine. I think we’re going to have a good relationship. They need the federal government not only for funding, and I’m not saying take it away, but they need it for advice. They’ll need maybe equipment that we have. We have a tremendous stockpile that we’re in the process of completing. We’re in a very good position. Again, the cupboard was bare when I got here. Nobody ever thought a thing. In all fairness to previous administrations, nobody ever thought anything like this was going to happen, but it did happen. Now, the governor’s will be very, very respectful of the presidency. Again, this isn’t me, this is the presidency. The presidency has such a great importance in terms of what we’re doing. And you can talk about constitution, you can talk about federalism, you can talk about whatever you want, but the best way, I’m talking now from a managerial standpoint is to let individual governors run individual states and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them. Yeah, john."
2020-04-14,50:43,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, you talked about having testing and tracing equipment and the facility for that in place to open up the government. Dr. Fauci said this morning that that critical testing and tracing ability does not currently exist."
2020-04-14,51:03,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. Look, I don’t know. I don’t know what he said."
2020-04-14,51:03,John (Reporter),My question…
2020-04-14,51:03,Donald Trump,"I don’t know, look, I don’t know. Hey, John, I don’t know what he said. Nobody knows."
2020-04-14,51:03,Unnamed,My question is will it exist by May 1st?
2020-04-14,51:08,Donald Trump,"The individual governors have testing. The individual governors… We have many forms of testing and new testing is being developed. Our country has to get opened and it will get open and it’ll get opened safely and hopefully quickly. Some areas quicker than other areas, but there is tremendous testing and the governors will use whatever testing is necessary and if they’re not satisfied with their testing, they shouldn’t open, but they’ll use whatever testing is necessary. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-14,51:40,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President, back to the W.H.O., will you support the organization again, if Tedros is immediately replaced or do you want to see him step down as possible-"
2020-04-14,51:51,Donald Trump,"We’re doing an investigation. I don’t know the gentleman, but I know there’ve been problems and it’s been very unfair to the United States. Just like the World Trade Organization has been very, very unfair and now they’re coming into line. When they consider China a developing nation and because China’s a developing nation, they take massive advantage of the United States. Why did another presidents stop this? I’ve been talking about it from the day I got in and we’re looking at that very, very strongly. World trade, W, so I have problem with World Health and World Trade, both of them, I’m not sure which is worse, you want to know the truth but we’ll figure it out, okay. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-14,52:27,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you were just criticizing the W.H.O. for praising China is transparent, but you were saying many of the same things about China just a couple of months ago. So I mean how do you square your decision-"
2020-04-14,52:42,Donald Trump,"Well, I did a trade deal with China, where China is supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country. We’re going to be watching a very much to see. Now we’ve got a little bit waylaid by the virus, but look, I’d love to have a good relationship with China, but if you look and we made a phenomenal deal… China has paid, because of me, china has paid us tens of billions of dollars over the course of a very short period of time, billions of it. Some of that money has been spent to farmers where they were targeted by China. We cannot let that happen. We can’t let that happen. So we ended up signing a very good trade deal. Now I want to see if China lives up to it. I know President Xi, I think he will live up to it. If he doesn’t live up to it, that will be okay too because we have very, very good alternatives. Go ahead."
2020-04-14,53:32,Unnamed,"Thank you. Today’s 600,000 cases, 25,000 deaths. I know you want to blame W.H.O, but I’ve spoken to hundreds of people across the country in the last few weeks who say they still can’t get tested and that they aren’t social distancing because-"
2020-04-14,53:46,Donald Trump,"So the governors … [crosstalk 00:53:48] Excuse me, excuse me, your question, you’re ready. The governors are supposed to do testing. It’s up to the governors. Go ahead please. [crosstalk 00:53:59] Quiet, quiet, quiet. [crosstalk 00:53:59]"
2020-04-14,53:59,Unnamed,"Mr. President, if they are following your lead that they are not social distancing-"
2020-04-14,54:10,Donald Trump,The governors are doing the testing. It’s now not up and it hasn’t been up to the federal government. Go ahead. [crosstalk 00:54:17].
2020-04-14,54:15,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I have a quick follow on the W.H.O. but if May 1-"
2020-04-14,54:19,Donald Trump,"I told them when they put this guy here, it’s nothing but trouble. He’s a showboat. If you keep talking, I’ll leave and you can have it out with the rest of these people. If you keep talking, I’m going to leave and you can have it out with them. Just a loud mouth. Go ahead."
2020-04-14,54:36,Unnamed,"If you could kind of clarify, are you basically lifting your slow the spread before the May 1 deadline?"
2020-04-14,54:43,Donald Trump,"No, I’m not at all."
2020-04-14,54:43,Unnamed,And then how many states-
2020-04-14,54:44,Donald Trump,"The governors are going to be running their individual states some of them will say, no, I can’t open now and some of them may last longer than we even would think. Others will say, I can, you can go. I don’t want to mention states, but there are numerous states that are in great shape right now. They are viewing the rest of the country like, we don’t even believe this is happening. We have a lot of those states. They’re set to open practically now. I mean they would be open now. We’re going to let them open sooner than the date. We’re going to pick a date, we’re going to get a date that’s good, but it’s going to be very, very soon. Sooner than the end of the month. But there are many states out there that are looking at this and they’re reviewing it and they’re saying, we shouldn’t be even included in this. There’s some that want to open up almost now. Now if we disagree with it, we’re not going to let them open. We’re not going to let them open."
2020-04-14,55:34,Donald Trump,"If some governor has a lot of problems, a lot of cases, a lot of death, and they want to open early, we’re not going to let it happen. So we’re there to watch. We’re there to help. But we’re also there to be critics. And on testing, very important. We’ve always wanted the states to do the testing. We’re now providing great testing, but the state has to provide the great testing. The state has to provide the ventilators, but they didn’t do that, so we ended up going into the ventilator business essentially, and we’ve made tens of thousands of ventilators and we solved the big problem for the states. But we want them to do the testing and we are there to help. Yeah, please."
2020-04-14,56:14,Unnamed,"I have two questions, I have a question on the-"
2020-04-14,56:16,Donald Trump,"One question, just one."
2020-04-14,56:17,Unnamed,"Well, I have a question on the governors, but first can I follow up on-"
2020-04-14,56:19,Donald Trump,One question.
2020-04-14,56:20,Unnamed,Can I follow up on Jordan’s question? Do you want to walk back where you did praise China in January for being transparent about the coronavirus?
2020-04-14,56:26,Donald Trump,"I’m always respectful of China. I’m respectful of other countries. Why wouldn’t I be respectful of China? In the meantime, China’s paid us nothing in your last administration, nothing in any previous administration. They paid us tens of billions of dollars because of what we’ve done. And the trade deal we have, they have to give us $250 billion in purchases. Let’s see if they do that and they’re also paying us 25% or $250 billion in tariffs. So we’re taking in, wait a minute, we’re taking in billions of dollars from China, they never paid us 25 cents. That’s a great thing."
2020-04-14,57:05,Donald Trump,"Now, if they don’t produce or if we find out bad things, we’re not going to be happy. But right now, and we’re doing that, that’s what we’re doing. Look, we have an investigation underway, we’re paying almost $500 million, we have an investigation underway on the World Health Organization. We will find out exactly what went on. And we may be satisfied that it could be remedied and we may be satisfied that it’s so bad that it can’t be remedied. And if it can’t, we’re going to go a different route."
2020-04-14,57:40,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:57:40] My question, you are criticizing the W.H.O. for praising China for being transparent, but you also praised China for being transparent-"
2020-04-14,57:47,Donald Trump,"I don’t talk about China’s transparency. [crosstalk 00:57:50] Well, if I’m so good to China, how come I was the only person, the only leader of a country that closed our borders tightly against China. And by the way, when I closed our border, that was long ahead of what anybody, you can ask anybody that was in the room, 21 people. I was the one person that wanted to do it. Deborah can tell you that better than anybody. I was the one person that wanted to do it. You know why? Because I don’t believe everything I hear and I close… And if we didn’t close our border early, very early, long before the kind of dates you’re talking about, we would have had thousands and probably hundreds of thousands more death. Please. [Crosstalk 00:58:28] Please, that’s enough."
2020-04-14,58:29,Unnamed,"Mr. President last week, you said that you would have data in the coming days about the coronavirus’ disproportionate impact on black Americans-"
2020-04-14,58:37,Donald Trump,"Yes, that’s being worked on very strongly."
2020-04-14,58:38,Unnamed,When will we have that?
2020-04-14,58:40,Donald Trump,"I would say within two weeks and it’s being worked on, Deborah, we’re working on that very strongly."
2020-04-14,58:44,Unnamed,The C.D.C.
2020-04-14,58:45,Donald Trump,"Okay, C.D.C. is working, but we’re getting reports on that. Yeah, please go ahead, no, in the back."
2020-04-14,58:48,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you’re talking about reopening parts of the country by the end of the month and if you do that and as a result you see a spike in cases in those areas-"
2020-04-14,58:58,Donald Trump,"But we may not, some countries having some countries haven’t. I’m watching other countries, I’m studying other countries as they open. I mean I don’t want to go into names because for some it would be a little bit embarrassing, but I’m studying other countries as we go along. So on that we have looked at every country that’s opened. Some successfully, some, okay, no total disaster, but some, okay. And some have to go back to the hotspot and fix the hotspot. We think we’re going to do it very successfully. Again, we have one country, but we have lots of different pieces."
2020-04-14,59:32,Donald Trump,"It’s a puzzle. We have beautiful pieces, beautiful states with capable governors. They know when it’s time to open and we don’t want to put pressure on anybody. I’m not going to put any pressure on any governor to open. I’m not going to say to Governor Cuomo, you got to open within seven days. I want him to take his time, do it right, and then open New York. I’m not putting any pressure on the governors. Some of them don’t need pressure or not pressure. I mean, they’re ready to go. And that’s a good thing. So we’ll open it up in beautiful little pieces as it comes along. Please go ahead, behind you."
2020-04-14,01:00:07,Unnamed,"Yes, just a quick question. You spoke about Governor Cuomo, just wondering if you have any thoughts on some of his remarks from earlier today where he basically said that were New York to be pressured to be open, it would cause a constitutional crisis. And he basically said that you declared yourself King Trump. So I’m wondering if you heard those thoughts-"
2020-04-14,01:00:29,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I’ve declared myself as King. You know, I heard he said that, but I didn’t see the remarks. But he understands how we helped him. He needed help. We gave him 2,900 hospital beds. He didn’t use him. We gave him a ship, he didn’t use them. But I’m saying that’s good because you know what that means he didn’t need them. But we said it was too much, but we wanted to err, we said, err on the side of caution as I said. We said, look, we don’t think you need it, but if you do, we’re going to have them built. And the Army Corps of Engineers did a fantastic job and the U.S. Navy did a fantastic job. But we moved the ship that was not meant for COVID and we had it redesigned for COVID, but they still didn’t have very many people going in. We’ll get along just fine, he understands. We’ll get along just fine. Please."
2020-04-14,01:01:15,Unnamed,Mr. President-
2020-04-14,01:01:16,Unnamed,"Mr. President, how do you assure workers in states that may reopen their fear about going back or fear of getting sick?"
2020-04-14,01:01:26,Donald Trump,"Talk up, please, louder."
2020-04-14,01:01:27,Unnamed,What’s your assurance to workers who are asked to go back to work but are fearful of doing so?
2020-04-14,01:01:32,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s going to be up to the governors. The governors are going to want to make sure everything’s safe. Now, I think that companies can do testing on a maybe weekly basis. You don’t have to do it every day with the same worker, but they can do testing. They could do temperature gauges, they could do a lot of different things. And you know, we’re only talking about for a period of time, eventually we want to get back to where we were. We want people actually sitting next to each other in ballgames eventually. We’re not going to rip out every other seat in baseball stadiums and football stadiums. We want to go back to where we were. I want people to understand that. We’re not going to be like the way you are. We have 300 reporters in the back that want to see, look at this, the way this looks. I don’t even like the way it looks."
2020-04-14,01:02:14,Donald Trump,"Although, I have a lot fewer reporters, that’s okay with me. But look at the way this looks. I’ve never seen anything, John, I’ve never seen anything quite like it. But there are a lot of people, we don’t want this. I don’t want this. I don’t want this. Eventually we’re going back, where restaurants that had 150 seats are going to have 150 seats, not 50 seats because they can’t make it at 50 seats. But more importantly, the atmosphere is even better. We have to get used to it. We have to get used to it. I don’t know that people are going to be shaking hands as readily. Some will. I said to some of the hospital people today, so will people be shaking hands again? And I must say I was a little surprised, most of them said probably, because there is some kind of a thing to it. I was never a big handshaker, but when I ran for politics, I said, I think I better start shaking people’s hand. Go ahead, John."
2020-04-14,01:03:01,Unnamed,"Mr. President, a couple of financial questions if I could. Larry Kudlow said this morning that the current run rate, the paycheck protection money will run out very soon. The plan to re-up it is stalled in Congress. What can you do as president to try to move that forward?"
2020-04-14,01:03:19,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re trying to get it done. The problem is the Democrats want to put all sorts of things, last time they put Kennedy Center and I hated putting Kennedy Center and I have great respect for Kennedy Center. But I hated putting it in the bill because it’s just not appropriate, right? But they wanted it in for whatever reason, they had their own political reason. And John, I said, watch the way that blows up and it blew up, I think it blew up in their face. We want to take care of our workers, we’ll worry about other things and other pet projects of Democrats and also Republicans later. But it’s been a tremendously successful program. I think you see it, the banks have stepped up, hundreds of thousands of loan applications approved, money is going out. It’s been a tremendous program, really has been. And obviously it was at a point where we’re almost, the money will be expired and we could use the refill for the workers. We want to be able to make sure that small businesses stay open, John, and I think that’ll happen. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-04-14,01:04:19,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Today, California’s governor set out a list of six criteria for reopening the economy there. Did he consult with you on that? And also you said earlier that there were as many as 20 states that could reopen their economies as early as May 1st, could you list-"
2020-04-14,01:04:38,Donald Trump,"No, I didn’t say all of them by May 1st, but there are 20 states. Actually, I was given a number, 29 States who are in very, very good shape. I don’t want to say whether or not the governor spoke with me about that, but we’ve had a very good relationship, Gavin Newsom, very, very good relationship. Yeah, in the back, go ahead."
2020-04-14,01:04:54,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you very much. I have two questions."
2020-04-14,01:04:57,Donald Trump,One question.
2020-04-14,01:04:58,Unnamed,One is from a person who can’t be here and so I-
2020-04-14,01:05:01,Donald Trump,Who cares? If he can’t be here that’s too bad.
2020-04-14,01:05:03,Unnamed,"All right. Well, one question that I have is from the United Nations’ economist, Maximo Torero says that there’s a danger that the food supply could be interrupted during this pandemic and I wanted to know what you’re going to do about that?"
2020-04-14,01:05:20,Donald Trump,"Well, I think our farmers are incredible. They’re producing levels of food, like just unbelievable. Our transportation, that’s one of the reasons I have the transportation people on the line tomorrow for the delivery of the food. Now we’re doing phenomenally with the food. And I will say the stores, Kroger and Walmart, which does a lot of the food and many of the stores they seem to be in very good shape, but I haven’t heard that at all. We’re going to be very strong on food supply. Okay, how about one more question, go ahead please."
2020-04-14,01:05:48,Unnamed,"Yeah. The death projections that you mentioned earlier are based on full social distancing until the end of May. So if you ease up on these guidelines now, how many more Americans do you think are going to die?"
2020-04-14,01:05:59,Donald Trump,"Well, I’m not easing up. First of all, we’ll have guidelines, even for the states that open and there’ll be guidelines, but we will not have any problem with that. Your question’s a very interesting question, but the states that are opening are not states which will have a problem with that plus they will have to adhere to guidelines until a certain point into the future when the enemy is vanquished."
2020-04-14,01:06:22,Unnamed,But the reason they don’t have a problem now is because of social distancing. So if you ease the guidelines-
2020-04-14,01:06:26,Donald Trump,"No, the reason they don’t have … is partially, and some of that will stay in effect. Much of it will stay at effect for a period of time, but the reason also is the different kinds of states. They have lots of room, they have fewer people and they have lots of room. And that’s one of the primary reasons. I want to thank you all very much, so a lot of positive things are happening. We’re going to have some very strong recommendations for the governors. We’re going to work with the governors, the governors are going to do a good job. And if they don’t do a good job, we’re going to come down on them very hard. We’ll have no other choice. Thank you all very much. Thank you. [crosstalk 01:07:01]"
2020-04-14,01:07:01,Unnamed,"On testing, how on Earth are we going to get to a point where we have millions and millions of tests where workers will be tested every day when they go to work."
2020-04-15,00:09,Donald Trump,Okay. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you.
2020-04-15,00:14,Donald Trump,"A big day today in the White House, all of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy. While we must remain vigilant, it is clear that our aggressive strategy is working, and very strongly working I might add. New cases are declining throughout the New York metropolitan area. Cases in the Detroit and Denver Metro areas are flat. Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and St. Louis are showing great signs of progress, and new cases in Houston and New Orleans are declining."
2020-04-15,00:57,Donald Trump,"The battle continues, but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases. Hopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress. These encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country, which we’ll be announcing. We’re going to be talking about that tomorrow. We’ll be having a news conference tomorrow. Sometime during the afternoon we’re going to be announcing a guidelines, and we’ll be talking about various states, and it’s very exciting."
2020-04-15,01:36,Donald Trump,"It’s been a horrible time to see such death and destruction, especially when you come out of what was the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest. There’s never been an economy like what we had produced, but we’ll produce it again, and I think we’ll produce it again very fast. The medical and healthcare advances we’ve made are critical to our continued progress. We’ve rapidly developed the most expansive and accurate testing system anywhere in the world and have completed more than 3.3 million tests."
2020-04-15,02:10,Donald Trump,"To date we have authorized 48 separate coronavirus tests, and the FDA is working with 300 companies and labs to widen our capacity still further. Today, Abbott Labs announced that it is developed an antibody tests that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the coronavirus and potentially developed immunity. It’s a great test. The company says these tests could be available to screen up to 20 million people in a matter of weeks."
2020-04-15,02:44,Donald Trump,"My Administration is also distributing vast amounts of medical supplies to states across the country through Project Airbridge, which has been an amazing success. We have completed 44 flights, and these are flights of very, very large airplanes, massive cargo planes, 44 flights of critical supplies as of today, and an additional 56 flights scheduled in the near future. We have some very brilliant people working on this. It’s logistically incredible what they’ve done, and we’ve also been working on this with the military, and the genius of all of them together has been incredible to watch."
2020-04-15,03:27,Donald Trump,"In total, through all channels, the federal government has developed and delivered 39,400,095 masks, 431 million gloves, 57 million surgical masks and 10.2 million gowns. We ordered 500 million masks, and they’ll be coming shortly, and we’ve distributed 100 million masks. Following our use of the Defense Production Act, GM announced that its first ventilators come off the assembly line in Kokomo, Indiana. Great place. They did it in 11 days from start to finish. A remarkable testament to the ingenuity of the American worker. GM will ship over 600 ventilators this month alone, with thousands more to come. And we have other companies doing something similar, and I think they said that there’s a brief clip that we have of General Motors sent to us by General Motors, and I think they might be wanting to play that for your benefit. Please. I know you got a little bit nervous when you saw there was a clip about ready to be played, but that was sent to us by General Motors, and we thought it would be a good one to play. It’s amazing. You know what they’ve done in a very, very short period of time. They’re now making thousands of ventilators, and they’re coming out of the factory very rapidly at a clip that nobody can even believe. But we have others also doing it, and these are very high grade ventilators."
2020-04-15,05:56,Donald Trump,"So we’re helping a lot of people, and at this moment nobody needs them. We have to remember during the surge, nobody’s needed them for weeks now, but we’ll have them for stockpiles, and very importantly, we’re going to have them for other countries because nobody’s able to do things like we can do, and we’re going to be able to help other countries that are having tremendous problems, to put it mildly."
2020-04-15,06:19,Donald Trump,"My Administration is using every available authority to accelerate the development, study, and delivery of therapies, so important therapies. Treatments, and, ultimately, what we want to come up with is a safe vaccine. But, frankly, the therapies, to me, are the most important because it takes care of people. Right now the vaccines have to be tested, so it takes a longer period of time, but we have some great potential therapies already, and we’ll see how they’re working. We’ll be able to report on that, I think over the next week or two. Tremendous progress has been made."
2020-04-15,06:53,Donald Trump,"At least 35 clinical trials of promising therapies are now underway, so 35 different genius companies. If you look at AIDS, if you look at Ebola, if you look at so many things, they’ve come up with the answers to so many things. You wouldn’t have believed it. And we’re very honored to be working with them."
2020-04-15,07:14,Donald Trump,"They include the antivirals, and they have something which is incredible, keeps the virus from multiplying. A mechanism that keeps the virus from multiplying. Immune therapies that prevent the immune system from overreaching to the virus, and convalescent plasma treatments that use antibodies from the blood of recovered patients."
2020-04-15,07:40,Donald Trump,"So we have a lot of patients who recover, and they’re so happy to have recovered that the first thing they do is say we want to give our blood. And they do that. It’s incredible. We have thousands of people that are doing that. They recover, they feel they have an obligation because they’ve gotten such great care, and a lot of them didn’t think they were going to make it. As the entire US Government works to combat the global pandemic, it is absolutely essential that the key positions at relevant federal agencies are fully staffed, and we’re not allowing that to take place through our Congress."
2020-04-15,08:14,Donald Trump,"They’re just not giving it to us. We have many, many positions that are unstaffed because we can’t get the approvals. The Democrats are holding us up. We cannot get approval. We’ve gotten judges because we go through the process. I guess we’re up to 448 federal judges that we’ve gotten because we focus on it. We take the maximum time because no matter who the judge is, they take vast numbers of days and hours until approve. It leaves, no time left for others. Very unfair system."
2020-04-15,08:50,Donald Trump,"If a judge is going to be approved in one hour in one session, it doesn’t matter. They’ll take the number of hours and days. You’re talking about days to get one judge approved, and we’re close to 250 judges, but because of the way they’re doing it, there’s no time for anybody else in. Many of these people have been waiting for two and a half years."
2020-04-15,09:13,Donald Trump,"We have a couple that have been waiting for longer than that. They are currently 129 nominees stuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction. Many are nominated for vacancies that must be filled to assist with the coronavirus crisis and the resulting economic challenges, and I’ve read over the couple of years, well, I didn’t fill positions. I don’t fill positions. In some cases we don’t need the position, and I’m all for that, but in many cases you do, but we can’t get them approved by the Democrats. They won’t release them."
2020-04-15,09:47,Donald Trump,"The positions include the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Financial Markets of the United of the United states, and the Undersecretary of Agriculture responsible for administering food security programs. And Sonny Perdue, who’s going to be speaking today, saying, “Please can I have this man? Can I have this particular person approved as soon as possible?” He’s been telling me that for a long time, and the Democrats won’t allow it to happen."
2020-04-15,10:20,Donald Trump,"Again, every single judge, every nominee we have goes through a maximum, or at least they go through a long process. So it takes days and days and there’s no time left and it’s just a concerted effort to make life difficult. An example is Michael Pack. He’s my nominee for the CEO of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and he’s been stuck in committee for two years preventing us from managing the voice of America. Very important."
2020-04-15,10:53,Donald Trump,"And if you heard what’s coming out of the voice of America, it’s disgusting. What things they say are disgusting toward our country, and Michael Pack would get in, he’d do a great job, but he’s been waiting now for two years, can’t get him approved. The senators left Washington until at least May 4th. The Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances. The Recess Appointment, it’s called."
2020-04-15,11:25,Donald Trump,"The Senate’s practice of gaveling into so-called proforma sessions, where no one is even there, has prevented me from using the constitutional authority that were given under the Recess Provisions. The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees, or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments. We have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government, and now more so than ever before because of the virus and the problem. We have to do it, and we have to do whatever we have to do. They’ve made it very, very difficult to run government. I don’t think any Administration has done anywhere near what we’ve done in three and a half years, but every week they put up roadblocks, whether it’s Russia, Russia, Russia, or whether it’s impeachment hoax or whatever it may be. It’s always roadblocks and a waste of time. If the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both Chambers of Congress. The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony, proforma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis. It is a scam. What they do. It’s a scam and everybody knows it, and it’s been that way for a long time, and perhaps it’s never done before. It’s never been done before."
2020-04-15,13:07,Donald Trump,"Nobody’s even sure if it has, but we’re going to do it. We need these people here. We need people for this crisis, and we don’t want to play any more political games. I’ve been waiting for two and a half years, three years for some of these people. And they’re great people. They left law firms, they left jobs, they gave up everything to do it, and they’ve been waiting for three years, two and a half years, two years, one year to get approved."
2020-04-15,13:31,Donald Trump,"It’s ridiculous. And everyone knows they’re going to be approved, but there’s only so many hours in the day when you go through judges and you go through lengthy hearings on judges that they know should be approved immediately, and they could do it in one session, and they could do it in one hour. And instead it takes them many days."
2020-04-15,13:51,Donald Trump,"In order to advance the health and security of our nation and all nations, as we announced yesterday, the US government has put a hold on funding to the WHO, World Health Organization, pending a review of the organization’s cover up in mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak. Over the objections of the WHO, we took decisive action and early lifesaving action to suspend travel from China. They didn’t want to do it. They were angry that we did it. It was early on. They were angry that we did. It took them a long time to realize what was going, but I have a feeling they knew exactly what was going on."
2020-04-15,14:32,Donald Trump,"Tragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn’t do any form of ban, and you see what happened to Italy. You see what happened to Spain. You see what happened to France. WHO’s guidance had failed to control their borders at a very crucial phase, quickly unleashing the contagion around the world. That was a horrible, tragic mistake, or perhaps they knew. I’m sure they didn’t know the gravity of it-"
2020-04-15,15:03,Donald Trump,"They knew. I’m sure they didn’t know the gravity of it, but perhaps they knew. Because if they knew the gravity, that would be an even worse offense. To ease the economic pain of millions of American families, we’ve now processed $300 billion in loans to more than 1 million small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. This action has saved millions of American jobs. It’s been an incredible success and they want to replenish it now, but again, the Democrats don’t want to do that. This is money that goes to the workers of our country. Phase one was $350 billion and now phase two we want to do $250 billion. This goes to workers and it goes to small businesses so we can save all the small businesses around our nation."
2020-04-15,15:56,Donald Trump,"Mike McFarlane from Nebraska recently said this historical relief has been a godsend for his small factory and the 136 Americans who worked there, to save those jobs. Another small business owner, Tim Miller from Oklahoma, called the program a total lifesaver for his auto repair shops for employees. Stories like these underscore why Congress must replenish the Paycheck Protection Program immediately. The Republicans want to do it, they want to do it immediately, they want to do it now, and the Democrats are stopping it."
2020-04-15,16:31,Donald Trump,"A short time ago, CDC issued public health guidelines for critical industries. In a few moments Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue will elaborate on how these guidelines apply to our nation’s dedicated workers in the food processing profession because it’s a profession, it’s incredible what they do. Food processing and they’re keeping our grocery stores full. The shelves are not bare like the shelves that I inherited when we took over the stockpile, the medical stockpile where the shelves were bare, the cupboard was bare, I say. Tomorrow I’ll also be leading a call with elected officials who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed, and we really think with all of the stimulus and all of the pent up demand, we’re going to have an economy that really comes back quickly, and we’d like to see it more than match what we had before."
2020-04-15,17:33,Donald Trump,"What we had before was a miracle and we think this is going to be even more than a miracle. We’re going to do it because we have the greatest people in the world. We’ll also be speaking to America’s governors tomorrow, and then we’ll be announcing exactly what’s happening. You already know we’ll be opening up states, some states much sooner than others, and we think some of the States can actually open up before the deadline of May 1st, and I think that that will be a very exciting time indeed. Governors are looking forward, they’re chomping at the bit to get going."
2020-04-15,18:06,Donald Trump,"Again, not all states are the same. They’re very different. Some are having very little problems. Some have done such a good job that they have very little problem and they’re ready to go, so Vice President Pence and I will be speaking with the governors tomorrow. We’ll be discussing procedures."
2020-04-15,18:23,Donald Trump,"Today I spoke with the leaders of many of our nation’s most renowned companies and organizations on how to achieve the full resurgence of the American economy. My discussions included top leaders in health and healthcare, transportation, technology, financial services, food, beverages, hospitality, real estate, retail, agriculture, construction, energy, labor, manufacturing and sports industries. We want to get our country open again. We want to have our sports leagues open. You want to watch sports. It’s important. We miss sports, we miss everything. We want to get back."
2020-04-15,19:05,Donald Trump,"These experts and innovators provided extremely productive feedback on how to safely reboot our economy. They gave us a lot of great ideas. We spoke to a lot of very, very smart people. The highest of the high tech, the level of IQ on some of those calls was about the highest you’ve ever seen in a phone call, that I can tell you. But we have a lot of great thought went into those calls and a lot of questions came out and also statements, very strong statements, as to what they recommend. I think it was a great day. We did a lot of calling with a lot of very prominent people, but more importantly, very smart people and people that love our country."
2020-04-15,19:47,Donald Trump,"They talked about the vital importance of our wide array of relief measures to address the present crisis and they provided valuable insights on how to move forward, including on the role of protective gear where we have tremendous amounts of protective gear coming in, robust testing and the future use of therapies and treatments. They also underscored the crucial importance of strong supply chains and communications infrastructure. We’re talking about infrastructure for the middle of our country. We’re talking about broadband and things that they frankly don’t have and haven’t had for a long time because a lot of politicians forgot about them. Can’t forget about them. They’re really the heart and soul. Can’t forget about them."
2020-04-15,20:36,Donald Trump,"And we’re talking about the tele-medical, it’s a new thing, and it’s incredible what they’ve been able to do. This is an industry that’s just growing, but it’s grown by leaps and bounds over the last five weeks. People are learning so much without the ability to see a doctor, they’re learning so much and a lot of good things are happening. Something that’s really, going forward, I think going to be very important for our country."
2020-04-15,21:02,Donald Trump,"As we’ve seen throughout our proud history, America’s never greater than when our people are working in unison toward a common goal. That’s what’s happening right now. We’ll go ahead, we’ll forge an even brighter future today than we had and we’ll be, along with other nations hopefully, we’re working with other nations, we’ll be the comeback kids. All of us, all of us."
2020-04-15,21:26,Donald Trump,"It’s incredible what’s going on. I’m very proud of the people of this country. I’m very proud of the people I spoke to today. These are truly great, brilliant people and we’ve gained tremendous insights. So tomorrow is going to be a very big day. We’re going to be speaking with the governors, we’ll have some information on some openings, and again we’ll have some openings that will exceed our expectations and they’ll be safe, they’ll be strong, but we want to get our country back. We want to get our country back and we’re going to do it, and we’re going to do it soon. With that, I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and say a few words and then Secretary Sonny Purdue, and then Vice President Pence. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you."
2020-04-15,22:18,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. President and thank you for summarizing the states and what we’re seeing. So over the last five to six days we’ve seen declines in cases across the country, and this has been very reassuring for us. At the same time, we know that mortality and the fatalities that we’re facing across the United States continue. We know the number of people who are still in the hospitals in the ICUs, and we want to continue to recognize the healthcare workers who are on the front lines and really recognize how low the United States case fatality rates are compared to other countries. And this is really due not only to our technology, but how that technology is utilized to save lives. At the same time, I’m inspired by the American people who continue social distancing. These cases continue to decline because of the strong work of the American people."
2020-04-15,23:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Also wanted to let you know that we do have nine states that have less than a thousand cases and less than 30 new cases per day, so we’re looking at states and metro areas as individual areas. We talked before how each of these curves are different. Each of the [inaudible 00:23:33] experiences are different. We have some states like California and Washington state, Oregon, they never really had a peak because of so much work that their populations did to decrease and keep the new cases down. So each of these into individual states and individual metros are being studied very specifically."
2020-04-15,23:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I do want to highlight, and we are remaining concerned and we’ve been having discussions with Rhode Island. Rhode Island and Providence are in a unique situation. First they had increasing cases from the New York City area and now they have new increase in cases from the Boston area. They are caught between two incredible hotspots in the country. They’re doing an extraordinary job. They’re caring for the individuals in the front lines, but Providence continues to have new cases and we do continue to work with specific States that have specific outbreaks related to individual occurrences."
2020-04-15,24:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I will just remind the American people again, this is a highly contagious virus. Social gatherings, coming together, is there always a chance that a asymptomatic person can spread the virus unknowingly. No one is intending to spread the virus. We know if you are sick you will stay home. But to all of you that are out there that would like to join together and just have that dinner party for 20, don’t do it yet. Continue to follow the presidential guidelines. We really appreciate the work of the American people. We see as a country we’re improving, we see as metro areas, we’re improving, we see as communities, as counties and as States we’re improving, but that also still requires everyone to continue to social distance."
2020-04-15,25:21,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And in the end we do have states that have very few cases and very few new cases, and so these are the ones that president is referring to that have been silent, relatively silent throughout this epidemic and pandemic that many of us have faced. And so these are the groups they’re working with very specifically and each of these governors and each of these mayors will have to make decisions after generalized guidelines are put out so that they can do what’s best for their communities. They are at the front line. And I wanted to conclude by really thanking my PEPFAR teams around the world who have been working tirelessly throughout the world to ensure that Africa and Asia doesn’t experience this level of infections that we have seen here."
2020-04-15,26:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"They’ve turned over their capacities from their embassies, our US hires throughout the world, our ambassadors are still on the front line with our local staff working with ministries of how to confront this virus around the globe, and I assure you that they are continuing to invest in the health structures, the laboratory, and the front line care to ensure that all of the work that we have done against TB, HIV, and Malaria continues, but that we use our capacity, our laboratories, our clinics, our hospitals that have been built by the American people and the generosity of the American people to really combat this COVID-19 around the globe. Thank you."
2020-04-15,26:51,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you, doctor. Sonny, please."
2020-04-15,26:58,Sonny Perdue,"Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to be here with you today and to, I want you to know it’s an honor to represent you in leading the Department of Agriculture and represent the constituency who are crucial in maintaining our nation’s food security, enabling us to keep food on the table of our American families. Not only just food, but wholesome and safe food as well."
2020-04-15,27:20,Sonny Perdue,"I’d like to start my remarks today by echoing what my colleagues, the CDC have been saying regarding the health and safety of our essential employees across the United States. CDC’s provided strategies there that aimed at helping our most critical workers both in healthcare and in food processing to quickly and safely to return to work after potential exposure to COVID-19, provided those workers are symptom-free, and this guidance will help these critical industries in the food sector provide that protect the health and safety of essential workers while keeping critical functions working throughout the COVID-19 response."
2020-04-15,27:59,Sonny Perdue,"As we know, any employee who developed symptoms while on the job should go home immediately, and the interim guidances in line with CDC’s recommendations for healthcare workers caring for those sick with COVID-19. So we appreciate the dedication and commitment of all the brave men and women working to keep their communities fed, and we will continue to work with the CDC to keep those individuals as safe as possible during these challenging times."
2020-04-15,28:27,Sonny Perdue,"In that vein, there’s been a lot happening this week as COVID-19 is impacting food processing facilities as you know. For Americans who may be worried about access to good food because of this, I want to assure you the American food supply is strong, resilient, and safe. And in fact, our food supply chain has shown tremendous agility in shifting production and logistics so suddenly from restaurant and institutional settings to retail settings. To all of the employers out there in this sector, it’s critical that you follow CDC guidelines and guidance and best practices to keep all of your employees and people safe and healthy. To employers and local public health officials advising them, the CDC has issued guidelines on how to mitigate a situation if you have a positive case in one of your facilities."
2020-04-15,29:22,Sonny Perdue,"We need our local health authorities and our state health authorities to do everything they can to balance the demand of keeping our facilities operational and our critical industries going, while at the same time keeping the health and safety of employees as a top priority, as well as our communities. So I want to also take this time to thank all of our critical, essential food supply chain workers. The entire country is counting on these patriotic individuals by doing the work in our food supply chain. These dedicated workers include obviously farmers and producers, but also processors, truckers, and grocery store workers, as you know. America’s, depending on what you have-"
2020-04-15,30:03,Sonny Perdue,"… workers, as you know. America’s depending on what you have, the food we need to feed our families, and you’re the ones who are making that happen. Thank you. As an entire nation, we’re truly thankful for the work you’re doing, and we recognize that you are the true patriotic heroes during this national emergency along with our healthcare workers. Before I sign off here, Mr. President, I want to remind you and all of us have one more thing. In the United States, we have plenty of food for all of our citizens. I want to be clear. The bare store shelves that you may see in some cities in the country are a demand issue, not a supply issue. The way food is prepared and packaged to be sold in a restaurant or a school is significantly different than the way it’s packaged for you to buy in the grocery store."
2020-04-15,30:47,Sonny Perdue,"Our supply chain is sophisticated, efficient, integrated, and synchronized, and it’s taken us a few days to relocate the misalignment between institutional settings and grocery settings, but that does not mean that we don’t have enough food in this country to feed the American people. You might think of it as an interstate when it’s little flowing along well, and you have a crash at one place. It backs up, and that’s what’s happening in the food supply chain, but we’re working through that. Through all this, our food supply chain has proven to be very resilient just like American people. To the extent we have challenges we have and continue to need to work through it all together, and we can and we will get through this with a whole of America approach, Mr. President, and a critical partnership between state and local health officials and management of companies and the employees, and we will meet any challenges we face by working together. Thank you, sir, for the opportunity."
2020-04-15,31:47,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Before the vice president comes up, I just wanted to say, speaking of Sonny, China has paid us billions of dollars. Many, many billions of dollars in tariffs, which we’ve distributed some to the farmers, because they were targeted. We have many billions of dollars being held by Sonny, and I’ve told him to distribute much of that money to the farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and now they’re benefiting by the amount that they were targeted, and we are very honored to do that. Sonny, you’re going to start that process very soon. You’ll let the farmers know. Nobody can take advantage of our farmers, so we have a lot of money that we’ve taken in from China. We’re going to be distributing that money from Sonny to the farmers, and there’s tremendous money over at above that. That money was paid directly into the treasury of the United States. This has never happened to China before. They never gave us 25 cents. Now they’re paying us billions of dollars, and we appreciate it. So thank you very much, Sonny. Great job. Mike, please."
2020-04-15,33:01,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. The white house coronavirus task force met today. It was reported to us that we’ve conducted and completed 3,324,000 tests and across the nation. More than 619,000 Americans have tested positive, but as you reflected yesterday when we welcomed coronavirus survivors here to the White House from across the country, some more than 45,000 Americans have fully recovered now. Sadly, we mourn than the loss of more than 27,000 of our countrymen. Our hearts are with their families and with the families of all of those that continue to struggle with the serious consequences of this illness. But as Dr. Birx just reflected, despite the heartbreaking losses, we’re getting there, America. Because of the efforts of people all across this country to put into practice the president’s coronavirus guidelines, because of their adherence to the direction of state and local authorities, as Dr. Birx just reflected, we see great signs of progress from the West Coast to the East Coast."
2020-04-15,34:17,Mike Pence,"President Trump has directed our team to develop new guidelines that will be presented tomorrow to our nation’s governors and released to the American people thereafter. The American people will be encouraged to know that as we stand here today, 24% of the counties of this country have no reported coronavirus cases. In fact, half of the states in America have less than 2,500 cases per state. This is a great tribute to the efforts by the people of those communities, but as the president suggested, when we unveil the guidelines that the team has been working to present tomorrow to our nation’s governors, we’re going to reflect on the fact that, as the president said, there will be areas of the country that will require continued mitigation and strong efforts, and there will be other areas of the country that will be given guidance for greater flexibility. The president has so directed our team."
2020-04-15,35:24,Mike Pence,"When we think of more than 619,000 Americans having tested positive, more than 45,000 having recovered, and we wanted to announce today that the FDA recently announced efforts to facilitate the development and access to convalescent plasma. Mr. President, you’ve spoken about this. People who have recovered from the coronavirus have antibodies in your bloodstream that can attack the virus. The Mayo Clinic today is working with the Red Cross to make sure the coronavirus patients have access to the convalescent plasma treatments, and over a thousand institutions across America have already joined this program. We want to urge every American who has recovered from the coronavirus for at least two and preferably four weeks to contact your local blood or plasma donation center and arrange to donate. It’s one more way that the American people can do their part and step forward, and thousands have already done so, and we know that tens of thousands will join them."
2020-04-15,36:28,Mike Pence,"On the subject of supplies, Mr. President, I’ll be very brief, because you detailed a great amount. As the president mentioned, the Airbridge has completed the 44 flights. 56 more are scheduled, but on the subject of facial masks, which are so important for the protection of critical infrastructure, I’m pleased to report that the average daily delivery through the commercial network through our Airbridge is 22 million facial mask coming into the marketplace. The average inventory in the network over a seven-day period is 80 million masks, and FEMA is actually working as we speak to move facial mass to priority infrastructure. Food supply, first responders. There’ll be 6.5 million mass that go out before the end of this week, an additional 20 million before April the 20th, and then we’ll be adding 6.5 million each and every week at the president’s direction. We’re going to ensure that all of those that work in food supply, all of those first responders have access to masks, and we’re increasing those every day."
2020-04-15,37:35,Mike Pence,"Finally, I know I speak for the president and when I say how proud we are of all of our healthcare workers across the country and how proud we are of the men and women in uniform, our medical professionals who have been deployed across the nation literally by the thousands. In fact, as we stand here today, 576 doctors, nurses and other military medical professionals have been deployed to 13 hospitals across the nation, 10 in New York and one in Connecticut, Texas and Louisiana each. As the president reflected a few days ago, because we did not have the happily did not have the demand on the Javits Center and on the Comfort in New York City, at the president’s direction, we have deployed doctors and nurses from those two facilities, two hospitals. In fact, the president and I were just speaking to Mayor de Blasio just before we came out, and he expressed his great admiration and appreciation for the relief that these medical military personnel have provided to incredibly dedicated people in our hospitals. 258 medical personnel just yesterday were deployed off the ship and out of the Javits Center into New York."
2020-04-15,38:47,Mike Pence,"With that, Mr. President, I’ll step aside, but it’s remarkable to think of all that we’ve accomplished over the last month since you first issued the presidential guidelines for America. The truth is because of what the American people have done over the last 30 days, we are slowing the spread. We are ensuring that every American family have access to the healthcare that we want any member of our family to have with the greatest healthcare professionals in the world. We’re saving lives and we’re healing our land, so we want to thank the American people for all you have done. Tomorrow, we’ll be presenting a new guidance to the governors of this country about how we build on our progress and reopen America in a safe and responsible way. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-15,39:34,Unnamed,"On the recess appointments, Mr. President, if I could?"
2020-04-15,39:38,Donald Trump,"Steve, please."
2020-04-15,39:38,Steve (Reporter),You’ve mentioned the possibility of adjourning both the Chambers of Congress. Could you explain what you meant by this?
2020-04-15,39:44,Donald Trump,"Very simple. If they don’t act on getting these people approved that we need, because we need them anyway, but we especially need now because of the pandemic, we are going to do something that will be something I’d prefer not doing, but which I should do and I will do if I have to. Caitlin, go ahead."
2020-04-15,40:03,Caitlin,"One, on a call with business leaders today, they said testing has got to be ramped up significantly for the country where they feel comfortable reopening their stores, their restaurants and whatnot. Isn’t that what health officials and state governors have been saying?"
2020-04-15,40:16,Donald Trump,"That’s what I want too, and we have great test, and we want the states to administer these tests for the most part, but we’re standing behind them. We have great tests. We’ve done more testing now than any country, as you know, in the world by far. We have the best tests of any country in the world. Nobody has the quality of tests. If you look at Abbott, what they’ve come up with in a short period of time, they’ve been incredible. Roche has been incredible. We have the best tests in the world, and we will be working very much with the governors of the states. We want them to do it. We’re not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas. We’re not going to be running a parking lot where you have a Walmart, which has been great, by the way. Walmart has done a fantastic job, but where you have a testing center and running that from Washington, D.C. The States are much better equipped to do it."
2020-04-15,41:01,Donald Trump,"But we’ll be working with the states. We’re standing behind the states. We’re going to work very closely with the governors in terms of that getting additional equipment. It used to be three, four weeks ago, two weeks ago, “Could we get more ventilators? More ventilators?” Right? We got them ventilators, and you don’t hear that anymore. It’s been pretty amazing what we’ve been able to do. Yeah, go ahead, John."
2020-04-15,41:23,John (Reporter),Mr. President-
2020-04-15,41:24,Caitlin,"You talked about Walmart. A lot of those testing centers are still for first responders, healthcare workers who have symptoms only. When is it going to be widespread enough to where these companies can feel comfortable being open? Will that-"
2020-04-15,41:36,Donald Trump,"Well, I think the companies will determine that and the governors will determine that and the federal government will. If we’re not happy, we’ll take very strong action against a state or a governor. If we’re not happy with the job a governor’s doing, we’ll let them know about it. As you know, we have very strong action we can take, including a close down, but we don’t want to do that. We’re working with the governors, and we’re working closely with the governors. The relationship has been very good. The vice presidents had a lot of conversations over the last two weeks with either 50 or almost 50 governors on every conversation, and they’ve been really positive conversations."
2020-04-15,42:13,Caitlin,What do you mean a close down?
2020-04-15,42:14,Donald Trump,"We have the right to do whatever we want, but we wouldn’t do that. But, no, we would have the right to close down what they’re doing if we want to do that, but we don’t want to do that, and I don’t think there’ll be any reason to do that, but we have the right to do that. Steve, go ahead."
2020-04-15,42:28,Steve (Reporter),John. You got me already.
2020-04-15,42:29,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-15,42:30,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, why did you have your name added to these coronavirus relief checks?"
2020-04-15,42:35,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t know too much about it, but I understand my name is there. I don’t know where they’re going, how they’re going. I do understand it’s not delaying anything, and I’m satisfied with that. I don’t imagine it’s a big deal. I’m sure people will be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful check and my name is on it. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-04-15,42:52,John (Reporter),Mr. President?
2020-04-15,42:53,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-04-15,42:54,John (Reporter),[crosstalk 00:12:53]. Why are you-
2020-04-15,42:56,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-15,42:57,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Dr. Birx just said that Rhode Island is saying an increase in cases from people that are coming from Boston and New York. You just said you’d like to reopen some states before May 1. How will you stop a second spike in cases if people are traveling between states? How will you control the flow of people-"
2020-04-15,43:14,Donald Trump,"Well, the governors can control that flow as an example. In fact, I just saw a little while ago it was reported that certain borders are being controlled already by states. They’re starting to take control of their borders, which is good, so they’ll be controlling. They may do testing for people wanting to come in. I had read that about Rhode Island, so they have to watch it. They have to be very careful. Yeah, please in the back."
2020-04-15,43:34,Unnamed,"Thank you. Mr. President. About reopening the country again, you said along with other nations, what form would it take? Are you considering also relaxing the border between Canada and the U.S.?"
2020-04-15,43:47,Donald Trump,"Our relationship with Canada is very good. We’ll talk about that. It will be one of the early borders to be released. Canada’s doing well. We’re doing well. We’ll see, but at some point we’ll be doing that. In the meantime, nations that are heavily infected … We have a lot of nations that are heavily infected. Some are getting better, some are still on the way up, unfortunately. We’re keeping very strong borders with those nations, but with Canada, we are talking about different things. Yeah, please?"
2020-04-15,44:13,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you said that the evidence suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases. What’s your evidence for that? What are the numbers saying?"
2020-04-15,44:20,Donald Trump,"Well, all we’re doing is looking at the numbers. We’re looking at our graphs. We’re looking at our models. We’re getting a great response from Deborah and from Tony and from many of the professionals that are working. We have great professionals working with us, and I think based on that, we’re doing very well. Based on that, it looks like we’re headed absolutely in the right direction, but some states are looking at other states and they’re saying, “I can’t imagine what they’re going through,” because they’re not in that position. They’re in very good shape. I would say that we have 20 states at least, but you really have 29 that are in extremely good shape. You have others that are getting much better, and I think with almost a few exceptions, you have every state that is either doing better …"
2020-04-15,45:03,Donald Trump,"Few exceptions, you have every state that is either doing better or on the way to doing better. Yeah, please. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-04-15,45:08,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. On your threat to adjourn Congress, clearly you have the power, Article Two, Section Three, but that’d be quite radical to do. Earlier last month, you were and the Oval Office talked about now is not the time for partisanship. How will that act lower the partisanship in this town, and could it potentially hinder your ability to get something done on Coronavirus?"
2020-04-15,45:33,Donald Trump,"It’s been a very partisan government for a long period of time, not just this administration, you can go back into last two administrations, you’ve seen a lot of partisanship. And even now you would think that we wouldn’t have, as an example, with the paycheck plan that’s going so well. It’s so smooth, so beautiful, almost without a hitch. All of that money is being distributed to small businesses. They’re giving it to their employees. It’s keeping them ready, viable, so when we open… And now it’s been so good that it’s almost depleted and we want to replenish it, and we can’t get the Democrats to approve it. And that’s a program that they and everybody else admit that are great. So you do have partisanship."
2020-04-15,46:14,Donald Trump,"We have been trying for years to get people approved for positions. People have left, one man left a law firm, one man left a big chain, he was a very successful executive. He left. It was two years ago. We have people that have been waiting for three years, and we can’t get them approved by the Democrats in the Senate because they’re taking so long to approve our judges. Now I have to tell you that I’m totally in favor of what Rich is doing with judges because that’s always seems to be a priority, and it’s a very important priority. I think it’s one of the great trademarks of this administration. We’ve approved record numbers of federal judges, and appellate judges, and two Supreme court judges, but rather than approving somebody who’s highly qualified, somebody that everybody knows is going to be approved, rather than going quickly, they take the maximum amount of time, whatever that time may be."
2020-04-15,47:12,Donald Trump,"And what they’re doing by doing that is taking days to approve somebody that could be approved in a quick vote. People that get phenomenal reviews in committee are going maximum number of hours. And what they do is there’s only so many hours in a day. Now we could have said, “Let’s stay.” I would have been in favor of that. They didn’t choose to do it. But I have a very strong power, I’d rather not use that power, but we have way over a hundred people that we very badly need in this administration that should have been approved a long time ago, and one of them is the head of voice of America."
2020-04-15,47:50,Donald Trump,"If you look at what they’re doing and what they’re saying about our country, it’s a disgrace. The people that are running that. We have somebody that’s really good, really talented and that loves our country, and I want to get these people approved. That’s one of many. We have professionals. Sonny, you’ve been waiting. For how long have you been waiting for the man that we’re talking about coming in?"
2020-04-15,48:12,Sonny Purdue,Two and half years.
2020-04-15,48:14,Donald Trump,"Two and a half years. So Sonny Purdue just happens to be here talking about something else. So you’ve been waiting for what are the most important positions as secretary of agriculture, is the position, it’s distribution. We need it now. We’re talking about shelves, we’re talking about cupboards. He needs it. He’s been waiting. He didn’t know he was going to get this question. You’ve been waiting two and a half years. The person is exceptional. That person left a very good job. And it’s embarrassing to me. He’ll say, “Do you think you’ll get that man approved?” He’s been saying that to me for a long time. It’s because of the Democrats."
2020-04-15,48:50,Donald Trump,"What we’re doing is, and I think anybody here would do it, judges are a priority. A federal judge who’s going to sit for 50 years, potentially, a young judge, going to be sitting for… That’s always going to have to be a priority, but because they’re taking so much time and approving every… They’re trying to put us through the mill. When you talk about partisanship and it’s never ever happened before. You can look at every administration in the history of this country, nobody, nobody has ever had hundreds of people not approved after three and a half years. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-15,49:23,Unnamed,"The timeline for that though, if Congress doesn’t act now, when?"
2020-04-15,49:27,Donald Trump,"They know. They’ve been warned and they are being warned right now. If they don’t approve it, then we’re going to go this route, and we’ll probably be challenged in court and we’ll see who wins, but when the court hears that we aren’t getting people approved, as Sonny would say, for two and a half years for an important position that we need because of this crisis. We needed these people before, but now we really need these people."
2020-04-15,49:50,Unnamed,"Back to the numbers for a second, when you talk about the numbers, the [inaudible 00:49:54] planes are going to come out tomorrow, it’s likely around 5 million more Americans putting their names in front employment benefits, but yet there are still a couple thousand people as well dying a day because of Coronavirus. When you talk about opening up the American economy, or at least in parts now, how do you balance that decision out, given both of those figures?"
2020-04-15,50:14,Donald Trump,"While we are, there has to be a balance. There’s also death involved in keeping it close, and I’ve gone over this with you, and I believe this so strongly. When you look at mental health, when you look at suicides, suicide hotlines which are exploding, people losing their jobs. When you look at drugs and people that didn’t take drugs and now they’re becoming drug addicted because they’re going through a problem, they have no job, they have no money coming in other than the money we’re getting them. We’ve opened up the coffers to a large extent, we’re helping people. This is why I wish the Democrats would help us a little bit with it, because they should. It’s purely partisan what they’re doing, and it’s bad for our country."
2020-04-15,50:54,Donald Trump,"But there is death by having this strongly closed country, we have to get back to work. With all of that being said, we’re going to start with States and with governors that have done a great job, and they’re going to open it up as they see fit, and we’re going to be right behind them, and we’re going to be working, we’re going to be supplying them with things if they don’t have them. We want them to have them. We’re going to be helping them with ventilators after this is over so that they can’t say, “Oh, the federal government.” We want them to have. They’ve had a lot of options, many of the governors have had a lot of options over the years to buy ventilators. They didn’t choose to do it. So we’re going to be helping them to fill up their stockpiles. We’re going to have plenty."
2020-04-15,51:37,Donald Trump,"And as I said, I’m very proud to do it. We’re going to be helping other nations. We’re going to be helping Italy, Spain, France, other nations, and we’re going to be helping them strongly. I think Russia is going to need ventilators. They’re having a hard time in Moscow. We’re going to help them. We’re going to help other countries that need ventilators. We’re going to have a lot. You see it with General Motors, you see it with other companies that are producing… We’re going to have hundreds of thousands of ventilators and it’s a great thing to have. Yes in the back please. Is anybody freezing? It’s very cold out here. So we can leave early. Right? A couple of more. Go ahead please."
2020-04-15,52:16,Unnamed,"Why do we have 20% of the world’s deaths from the Coronavirus, and we’re only 4% of the world’s population?"
2020-04-15,52:22,Donald Trump,"Well, you don’t know what you have. Do you think you’re getting honest numbers from some of these countries? Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of that? Does anybody really believe that? Here’s a story, we report everything, we’re reporting the cases and our reporting is good. We’re reporting every death. In fact, I see this morning where New York added 3000 deaths, because they died and they’re now saying rather than it was a heart attack, they’re saying it was a heart attack caused by this. So they’re ready. If you look at it, that’s it."
2020-04-15,52:58,Donald Trump,"Everything we have is documented, reported. And what they are doing is, just in case they’re calling it this, and that’s okay, that’s okay. But we have more cases because we do more reporting. We have more cases because everything is down. But does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries that you’ve been watching and you’ve been reporting on, and then it’s like they didn’t have the big thing. There have been some really, really bad heavily, and really some countries that are in big, big trouble, and they’re not reporting the facts, and that’s up to them. All I know is we report the facts and we’re a country that’s getting better. John, go ahead."
2020-04-15,53:43,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, multiple sources are telling Fox News today that the United States government now has high confidence that while the Coronavirus is a naturally occurring virus, it emanated from a virologist lab in Wuhan, that because of lack safety protocols, an intern was infected, who later infected her boyfriend, and then went to the wet market in Wuhan where it began to spread. Does that correspond with what you have heard from [inaudible 00:09:10]?"
2020-04-15,54:10,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t want to say that John, but I will tell you more and more, we’re hearing the story, and we’ll see. When you say multiple sources, there’s a case where you can use the word sources, but we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened. Go ahead please."
2020-04-15,54:27,John (Reporter),"In your many conversations with President Xi, Mr. President, did you ever discuss with him State Department concerns about lack of safety protocols that had been recorded to the state department from the embassy in Beijing about that laboratory."
2020-04-15,54:40,Donald Trump,I don’t want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory. I just don’t want to discuss it. It’s just inappropriate right now. Please go ahead in the back.
2020-04-15,54:47,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:54:47] from Channel Nine Australia. There had been calls in our country for our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to make funding for WHO, conditional on reforms to the organization. I wanted to get your thoughts on that, and if you had any advice for Mr. Morrison."
2020-04-15,55:02,Donald Trump,"I feel very badly about the World Health Organization, but it’s been a tool of China. It’s been, as I say, totally China centric. You take a look at everything that’s happened. They’ve been wrong. I was all for it at the beginning. What do I know? I walked in, I said, “World Health Organization, isn’t that wonderful?” And then you start to see all the mistakes. They didn’t want us to close our borders to China, to Wuhan specifically. They didn’t want our borders closed."
2020-04-15,55:29,Donald Trump,"You take a look, Mike was there, we were all there, and they’re criticizing me for closing the border. I did that very early, by the way, I did that very early while Nancy Pelosi was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great. She wanted to show that this thing doesn’t exist. These are people, I’ll tell you, we have some politicians on the other side that don’t know what they’re doing. If you look at timelines, you got to look at some timelines, but the World Health Organization, just like the World Trade Organization, I’m telling you, I call them, they have been treating the United States for decades so badly, and they’ve been so in favor of China."
2020-04-15,56:08,Donald Trump,"China took off when it joined the World Trade Organization because of what’s happened. Think of it, they’re considered a developing nation, and because there are developing… And we’re not. But we’re are developing nation too in my book. Okay, we’re developing too. But the fact is we have been treated so badly by these organizations, and believe me, I’m looking at that one too. We’re winning a lot of lawsuits right now that we never won before in the past. We’re winning a lot of money that we never won in the past. That’s with the World Trade, but with the World Health Organization, what’s happened there is a disgrace."
2020-04-15,56:44,Donald Trump,"Here’s the other thing. We pay 400 to $500 million a year, China’s paying 38, 39 and $40 a year, and it’s like they control this group. I could do that too if I want to devote full time to it, have some very capable people dealing with Dr. Tedros. I could do it too. I could do very well with that. But there’s something going on. There’s something going on that’s very bad. Now the 500 million that we save will determine, we’re going to make a determination over a little period of time, but they’re going to either have to make massive changes, I don’t even know if they’re going to be able to do that, or we’re going to give money to people. We want to help people."
2020-04-15,57:29,Donald Trump,"You know what we do in Africa, with AIDS, people have no idea what we do and the money we spent, we were talking about it the other day, doctor, we are spending billions of dollars to help people. In the case of one that Dr. Birx is very much involved in AIDS, millions of dollars. And you know what’s a great thing? Nobody talks about it. Nobody gives us credit. We do that, and we do it very directly, but we’re spending billions of dollars to help people live, all over the world. But we’re spending $500 million to the World Health Organization, and there’s something very bad going on. And you know what? I’ve gotten very much involved. It’s been going on for a long period of time, and we don’t want to be the suckers anymore. So it’s cold out. We will talk to you tomorrow. Big day tomorrow. Very big day."
2020-04-15,58:22,Unnamed,With Dr. Tedros’ removal would you change your mind?.
2020-04-16,03:19,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Our nation is engaged in a historic battle against the invisible enemy. To win this fight, we have undertaken the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And that’s exactly what it’s been. We’ve marshaled every instrument of American power. And we’ve unleashed her most potent weapon of all, the courage of the American people. These have been trying times. A cruel virus from a distant land has unfairly claimed thousands of precious American lives. To every citizen who has lost a cherished loved one, your pain is our pain. We mourn as one national family. Our country has come together. We draw our solace from the faith that God has received and the departed… He has taken the departed into his eternal and loving embrace. They will never be forgotten. Over the last weeks and months, millions of Americans have joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt the spread of this horrible disease."
2020-04-16,04:43,Donald Trump,"The Army built field hospitals and sports arenas and convention centers. The Army Corps of Engineers, is great. Over 20,000 beds in record time. The Navy sailed hospital ships to our biggest cities. Lifesaving supplies and experimental medicines were rushed to the front lines, as we launched a rapid search for groundbreaking treatments and vaccines. We built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world and we’ve done more testing than any country anywhere in the world. We suspended dangerous foreign travel. We leveraged our industrial base to produce vast quantities of critical medical gear. And enacted a historic $2 trillion relief package. Through it all, we have seen the heroism of our doctors and nurses like never before. These are our warriors. The bravery of our truck drivers, such bravery, and food suppliers, such incredible bravery, and the determination and drive of our citizens. Through this unified national endeavor, we have made great progress. You could really say, incredible progress. Our experts and scientists report that our strategy to slow the spread has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Models predicted between 1.5 million and 2.2 million US deaths. If there was no mitigation, could have even been higher than that. And between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths with mitigation, it’s looking like we will come far under even these lowest numbers. Thanks to our all-out military operation and the extraordinary devotion of our people, we believe we will experience far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection, but there is no such thing as an optimistic projection on death. One person is too many. Our experts say the curve has flattened and the peak in new cases is behind us. Nationwide, more than 850 counties or nearly 30% of our country, have reported no new cases in the last seven days. Because of our early and aggressive action, we have avoided the tragedy of healthcare rationing and deadly shortfalls that have befallen many other nations. Nations which wherever possible, we are helping. In America, no person who was needed a ventilator, has been denied a ventilator."
2020-04-16,07:56,Donald Trump,"We’re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators. We’ve delivered thousands and thousands of ventilators to the states, and actually it’s been an incredible operation. We started with very little and we ended with a lot. The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries. Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we are calling, Opening Up America Again. And that’s what we’re doing. We’re opening up our country, and we have to do that. America wants to be open and Americans want to be open. As I have said for some time now, a national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution. To preserve the health of our citizens, we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy over the long haul. You can’t do one without the other, cannot be done."
2020-04-16,09:10,Donald Trump,"To keep vital supply chains running, these chains have to be taken care of so delicately. They’re delicate. The balance is delicate. We want to deliver food and medical supply. We must have a working economy and we want to get it back very quickly, and that’s what’s going to happen. I believe it will boom. A prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression, would inflict an immense and wide ranging toll on public health. This includes a sharp rise in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, heart disease, and many other dimensions of physical and mental wellbeing. Moreover, many patients have put needed medical care on hold, creating entirely new hazards for public health. Our country has suffered, the world has suffered. 184 other countries have suffered. Therefore, my administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased and deliberate approach to reopening their individual states. I’ve dealt with them now a long time and we’ve had a great relationship."
2020-04-16,10:39,Donald Trump,"Democrat, Republican, the relationship has been good. This strategy is based on hard, verifiable data. I want to thank, Dr. Birx, for her incredible leadership in crafting these guidelines in consultation with scientists, experts and medical professionals across government. Dr. Birx will explain the guidelines in more detail in a few moments. And Dr. Fauci has been absolutely terrific, we’ve all worked together and we’ve worked together well. They are interested in the health of our country and we’re all interested in the viability and making us truly great again. We took the greatest economy in the history of the world and we closed it in order to win this war, and we’re in the process of winning it now. Our approach outlines three phases in restoring our economic life. We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time. And some states will be able to open up sooner than others."
2020-04-16,11:52,Donald Trump,"Some states are not in the kind of trouble that others are in. Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we’re starting our life again, we’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion. Our strategy will continue to protect senior citizens and other vulnerable populations while allowing military and other groups of incredibly talented people, to go about their real business. And the business that’s supposed to be, hard at work at doing, and nobody does it better. Our military is the greatest anywhere in the world, and we’re so thankful for what they’ve done. Healthy Americans will now be able to return to work as conditions on the ground allow. Instead of a blanket shutdown, we will pursue a focus on sheltering the highest risk individuals, so important. We’re establishing clear scientific metric and benchmarks on testing new case growth and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing to each phase, and that’s each phase specifically, in the reopening of our country."
2020-04-16,13:25,Donald Trump,"This is a gradual process. As the case load in a state continues to go down, restrictions can continue to be eased and come off. Throughout the process, citizens will continue to be called upon to use all of their weapons in this war. Vigorous hygiene, teleworking when possible, staying at home if you feel sick, maintaining social distance, sanitizing commonly used surfaces and being highly conscious of their surroundings. Those are our weapons and they’re very powerful weapons, indeed. Governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states. Every state is very different. They’re all beautiful. We love them all, but they’re very different. If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that. And if they believe it is time to reopen, we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task and very quickly depending on what they want to do."
2020-04-16,14:35,Donald Trump,"We are also encouraging states to work together to harmonize their regional efforts. We’ll have numerous cases where states have worked and we’ll be working very closely together. As we reopen, we know that there will be continued hardships and challenges ahead. Our goal will be to quickly identify and address any outbreaks and put them out rapidly. If the virus returns in the fall as some scientists think it may, possibly, these guidelines will ensure that our country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly. At the heart of our strategy is the vital role of medical research, especially for therapies that will significantly improve outcomes for high risk patients and reduce the need for urgent care. This will be tremendously valuable in allowing life to eventually return to normal. At least 35 clinical trials are already underway including, antiviral therapies, immune therapies and blood therapies in the form of convalescent plasma."
2020-04-16,15:55,Donald Trump,"You’ve all heard about some of these events and some of these therapies, they’ve come a long way. What’s been done in the last four weeks is incredible. We will also continue to expand our testing capacity. We have now completed more than 3.5 million tests, by far the most anywhere in the world. Areas of our country that have been hotspots have done much more testing on a per capita basis than South Korea. We’ve done more than South Korea. And South Korea has done a good job, but we’ve done more. We will continue to work with governors to advise them on how to conduct both surveillance and diagnostic testing. We have now distributed over 600,000 Abbott ID Now point-of-care diagnostic tests. These are tests that are done on site, and within five minutes you know the answer, positive or negative. In recent days, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests performed by hospitals and academic institutions with more than 120,000 tests recently reported in a single day, far more than any country in the world has ever been able to do. And our numbers are actually going up."
2020-04-16,17:24,Donald Trump,"As these new and better testing solutions come online, we’re seeing this additional capacity reflected in the numbers. For this reason, the number of tests processed in commercial laboratories has dropped from approximately 100,000 to roughly 75,000 tests over the last week. The reason it dropped is because we have so many other tests and we don’t even have to go through the laboratories, but the laboratories have tremendous additional capacity and states feel free to use that capacity. Some in the media falsely reported this as a bad thing when in fact it is a great thing. Because it indicates that the states are moving to faster more local testing solutions including, on the spot tests. So this drop in the utilization of commercial laboratories is an affirmation that testing, which is at an all-time high, is growing at a historic rate. In other words, the laboratories are great, but now we have forms of testing that are much quicker, much better, and we don’t have to use the laboratories, but they’re there and they have a great capacity to do the work."
2020-04-16,18:45,Donald Trump,"As Dr. Birx has been advising our governors for weeks, we continue to have an excess testing capacity of 1 million tests per week available for use. And our capabilities are growing every single day, especially with the new tests that are coming onto the market rapidly. As we begin a science-based reopening, we must be extra vigilant in blocking the foreign entry of the virus from abroad. Border control, travel restrictions and other limitations on entry are more important than ever to keep the virus in check and allow Americans to get back to work. The sacrifices our citizens have made in this time of crisis will be remembered, studied, honored, and praised for generations to come. We’re really all working together. Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal, we’re all working together. This is not about parties, this is about our country. Now the American people are ready to rise to the occasion once again. They are ready to show the world once more that Americans can defeat any challenger. Together, we will rebuild this land that we love."
2020-04-16,20:03,Donald Trump,"Together, we will rebuild this land that we love. We will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share, and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of greatness and glory. I would now like to ask Vice President, Mike Pence and Dr. Birx to further explain the new guidelines. I want to thank Dr. Birx, I want to thank Dr. Fauci, And I want to thank really especially a man who has devoted 24 hours a day to his task force and done such an incredible job, our great Vice President Mike Pence. Please, Mike."
2020-04-16,20:49,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. The members of the White House coronavirus task force today, join the president to meet with my partisan group of members of the House and of the Senate to get their counsel on the development of what the president unveiled to America’s governors this afternoon. The new guidelines for opening up America again are a product of the best science and the best common sense that the president has marshaled on this team, and from a broad range of advisors from all across the nation."
2020-04-16,21:26,Mike Pence,"From the moment president Trump established the White House coronavirus task force, early on, he made it clear that we have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people. President launched a whole of government approach. And while we stand here on this day with more than 640,000 Americans having contracted the coronavirus, and our hearts go out to the families of the more than 31,000 Americans who lost their lives and those who continue to struggle with serious consequences of the coronavirus."
2020-04-16,22:02,Mike Pence,"The truth is that because of the decisive action that our president took early on, suspending travel from China and thereafter from portions of Europe and South Korea, screening passengers, and because of the strong actions in partnership with every governor across America, because of the extraordinary efforts of America’s healthcare workers on the front lines, and because of the cooperation of the American people and God’s grace, we are slowing the spread. We are flattening the curve."
2020-04-16,22:41,Mike Pence,"We have preserved the capacity of our healthcare system, and we protected the most vulnerable. In a word, because of the actions of this president, this administration, governors at every level, our healthcare workers and our fellow Americans. We’ve saved lives, and every American should be comforted by that. And we can see it in the numbers. In the charts that I’ll present today, these three maps track influenza-like illness, which in this instance is mostly coronavirus across America."
2020-04-16,23:19,Mike Pence,"The first map reflects the total number of cases on the week ending March the 28th. The next map reflects our data about the total number of cases on the week ending April 4th. And we stand here today with the final map reflecting the total number of cases across America as of April the 11th. With these trends underway, President Trump tasked the White House coronavirus task force to develop new guidelines for opening up America again."
2020-04-16,23:51,Mike Pence,"Those guidelines were presented today first to our nation’s governors. And it is our intention at the president’s direction to provide these guidelines to assist governors and state health officials in evaluating the most responsible manner to reopen the economies of their States at a time and manner of their choosing. The guidelines as Americans who are looking on will note, begin with what is the best criteria that our experts have developed? A downward trajectory in cases over a 14 day period of time, ensuring that States have proper capacity in their health care facilities."
2020-04-16,24:32,Mike Pence,"The second set of proposals includes a description of recommendations for state preparedness. And let me say to the American people what President Trump made clear to our governors today, that our administration will continue to work day in and day out through our task force, through FEMA, to ensure that our states have not only the medical supplies, but that we continue to rapidly expand testing across the nation."
2020-04-16,25:05,Mike Pence,"The president have reflected on the progress we’ve made on testing, but a few statistics for that as well, which I hope are an encouragement to the American people. On March 11th, we had performed a total of 23,588 tests. Because of the public private partnership that President Trump initiated with commercial labs across the country, that number was 83,500 by March 18th. And as the president just said, that number is 3.5 million today. It is our expectation that we will have tested more than 5 million Americans before the end of the month of April, and we’ll continue to scale those resources."
2020-04-16,25:40,Mike Pence,"So testing and medical supplies will continue to be an ongoing partnership with our states and we want our healthcare workers and people all across the country to know of our commitment to that. Finally, the president directed us to propose a phased approach to reopening our economy. It is based on up to date data and readiness, and will continue to provide the very best data to our states, working with their health officials."
2020-04-16,26:12,Mike Pence,The focus is on the mitigation of any risk of resurgence or the emergence of the coronavirus in states where it’s not yet emerged. There is a focus in the president’s new guidelines on the most vulnerable. And we made this very clear to the governors today. These new guidelines for opening up America again can be implemented on a state wide basis or on a county by county basis.
2020-04-16,26:41,Mike Pence,"And with that, I’m happy to turn it over to dr Deborah Birx. And if I may, Mr. President, I’d like to also extend my admiration and appreciation to Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, and every member of our task force that worked around the clock to develop these recommendations for opening up America where I know every American is grateful for your leadership and for theirs. Deborah."
2020-04-16,27:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. We’re going to go through these quickly because I know you have them and many of you have already spoken to them on television. Next slide, please. This is a very important slide. It talks about the gatekeeping on the gatekeeping criteria to moving into phase one. It’s very much related to what you just saw about influenza-like illness."
2020-04-16,27:33,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And the United States has been tracking influenza-like illness is through the Centers of the Disease Control for years. Both the state and public health officials are used to watching this. County health officials are used to watching it, and frankly, every family around the United States knows how to access this on the CDC website in order to get up to date information to the communities."
2020-04-16,27:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"It also looks at a syndromic emergency room type visits. Again, housed at the CDC, and really is our surveillance program that can be utilized for a lot of different illnesses, but in this case will be utilized for respiratory diseases. In addition, we are tracking the number of cases and it must have a downward trajectory for 14 days, as well as the influenza-like illness and the syndromic illnesses. And a downward trajectory and the number of positive tests with persistence of high levels of testing."
2020-04-16,28:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"For the hospitals, it’s to ensure that we can treat all patients without resorting to any crisis care, and ensuring that there’s a robust testing program in place for at risk healthcare workers, including front line responders with the emerging antibody tests. Next slide. Now, just to show you what this looks like. So what the CDC did for me under the direction of Bob Redfield was to chart what would the syndromic illnesses were reporting throughout the early part of March."
2020-04-16,28:58,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And you can see in New Orleans, respiratory diseases were starting to be seen in the emergency room. That is the red line. The cases are shown in the dark blue line. The gray mountain is testing, and underneath that is the blue mountain of positives. And you can see that the early alert was present from the emergency room about early respiratory disease. You can see it predated the cases. So throughout the summer, when we do not have flu to contaminate this picture, we’ll be able to follow the syndromic pattern city by city, county by county, community by community, state by state."
2020-04-16,29:39,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide. In addition, the CDC has the influenza-like illness net distributed throughout the United States. Very useful in the winter time. That first peak is influenza B in the red. That’s this season. I showed you all this seasons here, so you could see the seasons as they are displayed. The first peak is influenza B, second peak is influenza A, and then you can see the coronavirus. And you can see its decline, and it’s declining towards baseline. This will allow us, again, city by city, community by community, state by state, to look for variations in an early response mode in those localities that I described."
2020-04-16,30:24,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide. So hopefully you see that we’ve brought on CDC and their amazing talent of individuals at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and all of their abilities to this response, and also to the surveillance that we need in this response. But I want to call your attention to the third bullet on this graphic. So we’re tracking those two pieces that I described. But the third bullet is about setting up Sentinel Surveillance sites to be able to distinguish and find asymptomatic individuals, individuals that you’ve heard about that may be either presymptomatic or asymptomatic throughout their entire disease course."
2020-04-16,31:05,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We want to be able to find them in communities of particular vulnerability. So we’ll be doing Sentinel Surveillance throughout nursing homes, throughout inner city federal clinics, throughout indigenous populations, to really be able to find early alerts of asymptomatic individuals in the community and both for the syndromic cases that are tested, the flu influenza-like cases, and the asymptomatic cases doing contact tracing again with support from the Centers for Disease Control, working with each state and local government."
2020-04-16,31:39,Dr. Deborah Birx,"In addition, we want to make sure that all the healthcare facilities have adequate personal protective devices and the equipment to handle the surge, and to ensure the ICU can handle increased capacity. We want every state to have a plan for the health and safety of its workers in critical industries, and to protect the health and safeties of those living in high risk facilities, including senior care facilities as we discussed with Sentinel Surveillance, but also additional surveillance."
2020-04-16,32:10,Dr. Deborah Birx,"When we talked with all of the states that had not had a major metro outbreak, their Sentinel Surveillances picked up always the first cases in nursing homes. And so this is a very much a big focus of the plan moving forward. I won’t go into the rest of the details on this slide, but there’s quite a bit of detail on the expectations of every state and local government."
2020-04-16,32:33,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide. You’ll recognize this slide. Next slide, please. You’ll recognize this slide, it’s what we’ve been talking about in the 15 and 30 days to prevent the spread. It’s continuing those in critical hand-washing, our sanitizer, avoiding touching your face at all times, disinfecting surfaces, using face covering while in public, following state and local guidelines, and critically staying home if you are sick. I know a lot of people go to the workplace when they are feeling ill. You know when you’re feeling ill. It won’t get better by going to work, so we’re asking again for people to stay home when they’re sick."
2020-04-16,33:16,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide is for employers. To ensure that there can be social distancing and protective equipment, temperature checks, use of disinfectant in high traffic areas including break rooms, and ensuring that there’s no non-essential business travel, and then monitoring for any symptomatic individuals in the workplace. And again, if you become ill at work, to immediately to go home. And ensure that there’s contact tracing of all the individuals that become sick."
2020-04-16,33:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I’m going to go the through the phases very quickly, but you have the details. Phase one. Again, you have to go through those gating criterias related to 14 days of decreasing evidence of illness and decreasing testing despite adequate testing. So phase one begins with all vulnerable individuals, including those with co-morbidities, continuing to shelter in place, and ensuring that those that first go out into the public are not those that are most vulnerable to bad outcomes in this disease. And then ensuring that we continue to do six feet maximum physical distancing in public spaces, continuing to avoid large gatherings, and all non-essential travel for the employers."
2020-04-16,34:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide. Again, if a vulnerable population needs to return to work and cannot be teleworking, there should be special accommodations for all vulnerable populations as well as options for teleworking. We believe every employee should encourage work return in phases from 20% or 25% to 40% to 50%. And again, minimize all non-essential travel."
2020-04-16,34:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Phase one continued. Next slide. If the schools are already closed, they should remain closed. All visits to senior living facilities and hospitals should be continued to be prohibited. Large venues including sit down dining can only be operated under strict physical distancing protocols and maintaining those six feet. Gyms could open if again adhere to strict physical distancing, and elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient basis."
2020-04-16,35:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Phase two. Next slide. Next slide. Again, you have to go through the criteria again of a continuation of another 14 day decline. Among those criterias that were in the gating. Again, we’re asking for all vulnerable individuals shelter in place. We did not put a timeline on any of the phases. We want the governors with the data that they have, community by community, to be setting up those timelines. Again, we’re asking for the public to continue to maximize physical distance. However, we increased social settings to be able to now have 50 individuals and nonessential travel can resume."
2020-04-16,36:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,Next slide. This is for the employers. We still would like to encourage telework and the common areas should remain close or be physically distance. All nonessential travel for employees can kind of resume and then again special accommodations for vulnerable.
2020-04-16,36:28,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Next slide. This should be a relief to many households that have small children. Schools, day cares, and camps can reopen in phase two. Visits to senior living facilities however, should remain and hospitals prohibited. Large venues can operate, but solely under moderate physical distancing, and elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient and inpatient basis."
2020-04-16,36:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Phase three. And so phase three I won’t go through in detail, which is essentially returning to our new normal with all of the what we talked about through all phases. Continuing the good hygiene practices, continuing the respect for spaces between individuals. Because we know that we still have an issue with asymptomatic spread."
2020-04-16,37:18,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I do believe with this plan that we’re both confronting the issue of finding symptomatic individuals through our networks with early alert as well as those who come and present to different hospitals and emergency room with testing and contact tracing, but critically have put in place what we believe is a safety net through asymptomatic Sentinel Surveillance that is centered around our most vulnerable groups between nursing homes and native, our Native American and indigenous populations and our inner city groups that we know may be in multigenerational households and have unique risk. I’ll stop there, Mr. President."
2020-04-16,38:03,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. So as you’ve seen just now from the detail presentation from Dr. Birx, this is a rather robust program for reentering into normality. There’s a lot of details here, and I know it’ll take a little bit time to digest them all. So what I thought would be good since I really want to be brief to allow time for questions, is to kind of take us back to the discussions that we’ve had here before, and why this is a natural evolution from what we had said before."
2020-04-16,38:37,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"You might recall that on a few occasions when I was up here before you, I told you that when we get to the point where we’re going to take those steps towards trying to get back to some form of normality, that it would not be a light switch that you could turn on and off. I meant that in two different components. The first of all that we are a very large country, and we have different dynamics in the country. We have areas of the country that have gone through a terrible ordeal, and others that fortunately have gotten through this rather lightly. So that’s the first thing."
2020-04-16,39:17,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The second thing is that light switch on and off is the exact opposite of what you see here, which is a gradual gradation with the first thing and the only thing in mind as the health people here, my colleagues who are either physician, scientists, or public health issues, the predominant and completely driving element that we put into this was the safety and the health of the American public. And I know there are a lot of other considerations that go into opening, considerations that you’ve heard of from this podium. But the dominating drive of this was to make sure that this is done in the safest way possible. So let me just make a couple of comments to just reiterate more from a broader standpoint."
2020-04-16,40:03,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"To just reiterate more from a broader standpoint the things that Dr. Birx did so well in a very granular detail. First of all, in order to even consider getting into the phasing, you have to pass a hurdle and that’s the hurdle that we refer to as gating in. Now, when you think about it and look at the map of the country and look at the differences in different parts of the country, you will see that there are some regions, states, locations that are going to be almost already into some of that gating and will have already fulfilled some of those criteria. Others, because of the dynamics of the outbreak in the area, will take longer to be able to do that, but you don’t get to phase one until you get through the gating. And then, in order to make sure that safety and health is the dominant issue, the design of the phases where just that. You go into phase one if you get no rebound and you satisfy the gating for yet again a second time, then you go to phase two. If you have no rebound and you satisfy the gating criteria for a third time, you go into phase three."
2020-04-16,41:14,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So, there are multiple checkpoints of safety there. So, as I’ve said from this podium when we were talking about the first 15 days of the mitigation and then we extended it another 30 days, I essentially pleaded with the American public to say, let us make sure we do the best that we can to accomplish that. And in fact, mitigation works. You saw the charts that the vice president and that Dr. Birx put up. It worked and what we hope and I believe we will be successful, if we carefully do this again with the attention to the safety and health of the American public that we will be able to. It will be staggered. Not every state, not every region is going to do it at the same time."
2020-04-16,42:01,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"That’s clearly obvious because of the very dynamics of the outbreak, but we feel confident that sooner or later, we will get to the point hopefully sooner, with safety as the most important thing, to a point where we can get back to some form of normality. The one thing I liked about it that Dr. Birx said so well is that no matter what phase you’re in, there are certain fundamental things that we’ve done that are not like it was in September and October. You want to call it the new normal. You can call it whatever you want, but even if you are in phase one, two, three. It’s not, okay, game over. It’s not. It’s going to be a way that we protect ourselves because as we know and as I’ve said from this podium, it may very well be as we go the cycle around that there’ll be this virus that wants to come back to us. I think we’re going to be able to handle that. Thank you."
2020-04-16,42:54,John (Reporter),"Go ahead, Dr. [Inaudible 00:03:06]. So, I assume that there’s also a phase four which is after a vaccine is developed and available to everybody. So, the question on phase three being the new normal, are we during that phase going to be able to see things like packed arenas for sporting events, large crowds, concerts?"
2020-04-16,43:26,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The answer is it is conceivable that we will be able to do that. I think there will always have to be attention to making sure that we don’t do all that packing in together. I think we’ll be able to have sports events in that phase where you actually have participants there. I’m not sure you’re going to be able to do that uniformly and evenly temporally with everyone. But when people get to that phase, paying attention to the fact that if there is a rebound of any sort, that when you’re in that phase, you can respond to that or you put it back and go in the other way. So, the flexibility is that there may be some setbacks. Let’s face it, this is uncharted water. There may be some setbacks that we may have to pull back a little and then go forward. But John, the direct answer to your question, I do see us getting more towards normal."
2020-04-16,44:21,Unnamed,"Mr president? Mr president, if you take a look at the grading criteria, is that [inaudible 00:44:26] in these guidelines, there are at least a handful of states. I just looked at the trend lines. Idaho, Wyoming, Hawaii, Montana. They look like they’ve already satisfied that gating criteria. In your call with the governors this afternoon, did you hear back from any states who said we’re already there? We can start the process now."
2020-04-16,44:42,Donald Trump,"I did. I heard from a number of governors that said they’re in very good shape. I also heard not only from the call but I heard from some of the governor’s previous and I think you’ll have some very good things to report over the next few days about states opening up. And I think John, having to do with your call on sports, depending on the area, depending on where we’re talking about, you’re going to have large areas of our country where this has not been or has been totally eradicated, you’ll be able to have those filled arenas. Now, with everything being said, a lot of great work has been done on vaccines, but you have a testing process, therapeutics likewise. We have a lot of great things happening therapeutically that will be a step further. But in terms of sports, they’ll probably start off…"
2020-04-16,45:29,Donald Trump,"As you know, I spoke to the commissioners yesterday almost I guess of every sport, and many of them are going to be starting without the fans. So, it will be made for television, the good old days made for television, and it’ll go that way. And then, fans will start coming in, maybe they’ll be separated by two seats and then ultimately we want to have packed arenas when the virus is gone. We’re going to have packed arenas and we’re going to be back to enjoying sports the way they’re supposed to be. And the same thing can be said for restaurants. So, at a certain point in time when the virus is gone, we’re going to be back to normal."
2020-04-16,46:07,Donald Trump,"Please, go ahead."
2020-04-16,46:08,Unnamed,"Mr president and the doctors, can you clarify then, is the 30 day period to stop the spread, are those mitigation efforts still in place or have they been replaced by this new guidance?"
2020-04-16,46:19,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re going to be in place to a large extent, and it also depends on the governor’s what they want to do. You have very different states. If you look at Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, that’s a lot different than New York. It’s a lot different than New Jersey, so it’s going to be very dependent on the governor. As you see in the charts, we’re recommending certain things. There’ll be in place dependent on what the governor wants to do. If we see something wrong, we will be expressing ourselves very strongly."
2020-04-16,46:49,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr president, does this mean that states such as Montana or Utah that already made that gating period, will they be able to go to phase one as early as saying tomorrow if the governor decides?"
2020-04-16,46:59,Donald Trump,You’re talking about those states that are in great shape already?
2020-04-16,47:01,Unnamed,Yes.
2020-04-16,47:02,Donald Trump,"They will be able to go literally tomorrow, yes. Because they’ve met all of the guidelines, if you go back. You’re going back 14 days, you’re going back even a month and the ones that I’m thinking about, the ones that I’ve already spoken to governors about, they’ve met those guidelines actually pretty long ago."
2020-04-16,47:22,John (Reporter),"Mr president, what’s your message to the protestors we seeing, we saw a lot in Michigan but in other states that are saying that they are refusing to comply with the stay at home orders issued by governors and local officials? Isn’t it important for everybody to go along with this as we go through these phases?"
2020-04-16,47:40,Donald Trump,"Going through it a long time, John, and it’s been a tough process for people. I told you this, there’s death and there’s problems in staying at home too. It’s not just isn’t it wonderful to stay at home? They’re suffering. This country wasn’t built on that principle, it was built on an exact opposite principle actually, and I watched in one particular state where they want to get back. There were very strict sanctions that were put on people, that was probably the most strict of all, but I just think the American people have been incredible. John, when you look at what they’ve done, when you look at what they’ve been through, when you look at all of the death and all of the problems and all of the sickness, when you look at what’s happened, I just think the American people have been incredible."
2020-04-16,48:30,John (Reporter),[inaudible 00:48:30] those protesters to listen to the local authorities?
2020-04-16,48:31,Donald Trump,"I think they’re listening. I think they’d listened to me. They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion and my opinion is the same as just about all of the governors’. They all want to open. Nobody wants to stay shut, but they want to open safely. So do I, but we have large sections of the country right now that can start thinking about opening. There’ll be some mitigation and they’ll keep it going for a period of time, including masks by the way in areas that you wouldn’t even think. I asked a question today. I said, “Why would they wear masks in Wyoming or Montana or North Dakota?” And that’s if somebody should come in from an area that isn’t so successful in terms of what they’ve done. So, that will be a governor’s choice and we’ll have no problem with it."
2020-04-16,49:18,Unnamed,"Mr president, you spoke this afternoon with your new congressional advisory groups, 32 bipartisan members of the House, 65 bipartisan members of the Senate. One of the big topics was the fact that the Small Business Association loan pot of $350 million has hit the cap. It’s exhausted. There’s nothing moving on the $250 billion to replenish it. What did you tell those bipartisan groups today about getting the move on to get some more money into the hands of small businesses?"
2020-04-16,49:44,Donald Trump,"So, just for the viewers watching this or hearing you ask that question, exhausted is a good thing, not a bad thing. It went quickly. It is so popular. The banks have been incredible, including 4,000 community banks. 4,000, most people didn’t know you had that many banks. 4,000-"
2020-04-16,50:00,John (Reporter),There’s no middle of them.
2020-04-16,50:01,Donald Trump,"What they want is people want to keep this going and we’re doing it to keep the small businesses open and to keep the workers paid and we have a $250 billion request. The Democrats like it, the Republicans love it and to be honest, I think something’s going to be happening. I hope so because this is a very popular program. It was really executed flawlessly. The first day, they changed an application a little bit. There was a… But when you look at what Bank of America did and what Wells Fargo did and City and a lot of the banks, but when you look at what all of the community banks did, it’s been really incredible. Well, when negotiating with Democrats and they should frankly approve it quickly. This is a great thing for our country. It’s a great thing for small business and for the workers and we’re having a hard time getting them to approve it. I think it’s going to happen. It should happen really unanimously, but they’re trying to get things and we’re not too happy with what they’re trying to get. Please, [inaudible 00:51:01] Yes, please."
2020-04-16,51:03,Unnamed,"First, could you just say which states specifically you guys think have hit the gating requirements-"
2020-04-16,51:07,Donald Trump,"I’d rather not say that, but you’ll be seeing it very soon. I’d rather have the governors be able to announce and they’re very proud of it. They’ve worked hard. Some are in an area that’s less susceptible and some really was done, I think we can say, through talent. They really worked very hard and we have some states that got too much credit for what they’ve done. Frankly, I could name you a couple of those too and I could name you a couple of them and we have others that haven’t been given credit that have done a phenomenal job."
2020-04-16,51:37,Unnamed,"Part of the guidance seems to shift to states and companies the burden, not just of additional testing and surveillance, but also the new normal in which there’s smaller crowds in restaurants and bars and that’s-"
2020-04-16,51:52,Donald Trump,"Oh, that’s going to be normal. There’s not going to be a new normal where somebody has been having for 25 years 158 seats in a restaurant, and now he’s got 30 or he’s got 60, because that wouldn’t work. That’s not normal. No, normal will be if he has the 158 or 168 seats and that’s going to happen and it’s going to happen relatively quickly we hope, but that’s our normal. Our normal is if you have 100,000 people in an Alabama football game or 110,000 to be exact, we want 110,000 people there. We want every seat occupied. Normal is not going to be where you have a game with 50,000 people."
2020-04-16,52:30,Unnamed,"Sure, but to that point, best case scenario that happens in the states that are doing really well oi a month. Obviously, for I think a lot of other states that’s going to be longer than that. So, my question is what is the federal government going to do to help, especially companies, but states and local governments in those positions pay for what is now going to be an even longer standard?"
2020-04-16,52:52,Donald Trump,"We’re going to be watching over. We’re going to see that everything is working out smoothly. We’re in very strong communication with the governors. We’re going to be helping with testing. They’re going to be doing the testing. It’s got to be a localized thing and it really has been since I’d been involved because I came in and federal government’s supposed to do testing of parking lots in the middle of a certain state that’s 2000 miles away. It’s ridiculous, but the testing has been so incredible. Two things, testing and ventilators. Ventilators are really tough. They are very complex, they’re very expensive, they’re very sophisticated machines. Some are unbelievably sophisticated. Well, we built… You saw General Motors yesterday, thousands are being issued. We have 11 companies building them. We have not had one complaint in the last week and a half, which is surge time. Don’t forget when they were calling, they were calling because in two weeks and four weeks and five weeks, they’re going to need ventilators, not because they need them right now and we were right on our counts and nobody that wanted a ventilator didn’t get a ventilator."
2020-04-16,53:57,Donald Trump,"Plus, we have additional if there is a surge, we hope there’s not going to be a surge at all, but we’re going to be able to build up the stockpiles of states who didn’t have them, who should have had them. And we’re also going to have a big stockpile in the federal government and we’ll be able to help foreign countries, countries that need help because look, you have countries who’ll never be able to build a ventilator. It’s tough stuff. We’re uniquely talented in the sense that we can do things that nobody else can do. We’ll get right back to you. Peter in the back?"
2020-04-16,54:28,Peter (Reporter),"Thanks. You said you didn’t want to name the states that might be ready to go. Can you give us some, or maybe the experts Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, give us some sense of how many yesterday? You said 29 States were in good shape, you think as many as 29?"
2020-04-16,54:40,Donald Trump,"Peter, I think 29 States are in that ballgame. Not for opening, but I think there’ll be able to open relatively soon. I think the remainder are just getting better. Look, New York, New Jersey are having very tough times and they’ll be there at some point, but they’re not going to be one of the earlier states. They’re going to be later, obviously. I just spoke with the governor of New Jersey. We just spoke with Mike and a couple of folks, we had a great talk with him. Phil is a terrific guy. He’s working very hard, Democrat, but we get along. He’s working very hard. I guess the fact that he’s right next to this big massive city where everybody’s very closely together and New Jersey has been hit unbelievably hard. As hard as anybody in the true sense, but they’re doing a great job in New Jersey."
2020-04-16,55:33,Donald Trump,"Peter, that doesn’t mean that they’re going to be opening next week. That’s not one that’s going to be, but we have a lot of states that through location, through luck and also through a lot of talent earn a very good position and they’re getting ready to open. And over the next very short period of time, it’s going to be up to the governors. We’re going to work with them, we’re going to help them, but it’s going to be up to the governors. I think you’re going to see quite a few states starting to open, and I call it a beautiful puzzle. You have 50 pieces, all very different, but when it’s all done, it’s a mosaic. When it’s all done, it’s going to be I think a very beautiful picture, and very important is what Dr. Fauci said."
2020-04-16,56:18,Donald Trump,"It could be that sometime in the Fall there’ll be some flare ups. We’re going to be in a great position with everything we’ve done and everything we’ve learned. This was something that nobody ever saw before. Such contagion and very powerful. People don’t realize because we all probably have friends. I have a number of people that were just great people who were just decimated by what happened. Some are dead right now. They’re dead. They went into a hospital. One called me, he said, “I tested positive.” Four days later, he was dead. The following day after he said that, he was unconscious, so this is a tough deal. At the same time, some people got sniffles and they didn’t even realize they had a problem and they are supposedly immune. We’re going to find out about that. Even that’s a little bit soon because we don’t know how long the immunity lasts, but Peter, some states are in great shape and they’re really in great shape to open and I think you’ll have quite a few states opening soon and they’re going to be very vigilant. They’re going to be very careful. Go ahead, finish it up."
2020-04-16,57:23,Peter (Reporter),"Sorry. What public health experts have said that this [inaudible 00:57:28] if there were comprehensive surveillance testing, which we’re obviously not in a position to do, I wonder if maybe Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci [inaudible 00:57:34] feel comfortable."
2020-04-16,57:38,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Dr. Fauci and I will do it together. That’s why I wanted to put up the syndromic and the influenza-like illness piece because what is key in this is the early alerts and getting in there before they even know they have a problem. And I think CDC has been remarkable in building these platforms, Dr. Redfield integrated them, so they’re all on the same website. If you look at COVID-19, you go into cases, you can find all of the data and the beauty of it is the states are used to utilizing that through flu season. So, the testing and contract tracing and Dr. Redfield will be putting people in every single state to make sure that CDC is standing beside the state and local health officials to make sure that all of those cases are immediately identified and contact traced."
2020-04-16,58:28,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think what’s new and what’s really critical is this constant Sentinel surveillance for asymptomatic individuals in communities that we know are particularly vulnerable and that hasn’t been done in flu before. And I think that’s going to be the added dividend that’s really focused on who is most vulnerable and how do we get the fastest alert by generally screening people without symptoms. So, people who are just coming to the clinic will be screened for COVID-19 and we do have enough testing capacity to do both that surveillance piece as well as the diagnostic piece and contact tracing."
2020-04-16,59:05,Peter (Reporter),Just a follow up…
2020-04-16,59:09,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"People have gotten confused about that because in the beginning when we were focusing really on just mitigation and really trying to keep peaks down and trying to worry about ventilators and PPEs and things like that. When now when you get a little bit more grace period, you can start figuring out what is the penetrance of this virus in society? What are we missing in people who might be infected? What is the percentage of those people that are out there? That’s going to inform us greatly for a number of things, including the level once we prove that antibody test that you have is really protective, and we still don’t know that yet. We’re going to find that out. We may get a good feel of what the level of protection might be in society, but we don’t know that yet. So, it’s going to give us information as to what the vulnerable areas are and how we need to respond. Remember, there’s two types of-"
2020-04-16,01:00:03,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Vulnerable areas are and how we need to respond. Remember there’s two types of things, antibody tests and test for the diagnosis of who has the disease. One you need for contact tracing the other you want a need for finding out what’s in society. We’re going to have both of those much, much better as we go in the next weeks and months and by the time we get into the fall I think we’re going to be in pretty good shape."
2020-04-16,01:00:26,Donald Trump,"I just want to say if we see a hotspot possibly developing, maybe not, but if we see a hotspot developing, we’ve learned a lot, we’ll be able to suppress it, whack it. We’ll be able to do things that people weren’t even thinking about because nobody’s ever gone through this. In 1917 they went through something that was similar, probably not as contagious, probably more powerful in certain other ways, but we are going to be able to suppress it we think and we’re going to watch it very closely. We’re going to be able to watch things very closely. Please. Bob please."
2020-04-16,01:01:03,Bob,"Thank you, Mr president. I think what’s really important is during this bringing people back to work and our economy back to work and what’s going to go back is that we’re going to be very aggressively focused on early case recognition, isolation and contact tracing. In the event that we just went through, unfortunately in as we started, we were very capable of doing that when the initial cases all came from China all the way through January, all the way through to the end of February, we were able to identify cases early. The first 14 do the contacts, do the contact tracing over 800 contacts. We identified that two of those contacts were actually infected. We were able to isolate them. We were able to contain the outbreak. We’re about to enter a new phase of this where we’re going back to containment and mitigation is going to continue as Dr. Birx and others have said."
2020-04-16,01:02:01,Bob,"Some of the things that we’ve learned to do, we’re going to continue, but the major thrust of how we’re going to control and make sure that we continue to keep this nation open is early case recognition, isolation and contact tracing and that’s the fundamentals of public health. That’s what we’re going to do. You see, we have very good surveillance systems that are going to help us as we see these cases sporadically across the country. We’ve got to jump on them with early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing. That’s what CDC is going to continue to help build that capacity in the states across this nation."
2020-04-16,01:02:39,Donald Trump,"And one other thing because we discussed this today with the senators, we had the senators, we had the congressmen and women. There’ll be some areas of our country wide open plains wide open spaces with not that many people relatively speaking where you’re not going to have to do that. Senators were saying there is no reason to do that in certain states, in certain areas where you have the wide open. In other cases we will be doing that, so we’ll be following it largely that also will be a function of governors. They know their states so larger that’s going to be a function of governors. Yes."
2020-04-16,01:03:12,Unnamed,"Yeah. You mentioned that I think you used the term clear scientific benchmarks on testing and the main periscope that I think you guys are talking about is the IOL syndromic as well as the surveillance in the Sentinel testing. I just want to be clear, are you opening things up without doing widespread testing? Is that because you don’t have the capacity or you don’t think it’s necessary?"
2020-04-16,01:03:33,Donald Trump,"We do have the capacity, but you know you have states without any problem. You have states with few cases and those few cases have healed. You have states with very little death, relatively speaking. As I said, one is too many but you have states with very little and frankly they’re at a point where they have almost nothing. So this is a much different case than in New York or New Jersey where they’re going through frankly, they go through hell. And if you look at New York, I’m looking at bed count because you have to look at bed count and it’s really dropped. We built the Javits center with 2,900 beds and I mean they built it in four days. They did an incredible job the army Corps of engineers, it was not used very much. We sent the ship, the hospital ship in to New York Harbor and it was not used and we went COVID and it still was not used very much because the bed count has gone way down, way, way down."
2020-04-16,01:04:26,Unnamed,When do you see yourself getting back to campaigning?
2020-04-16,01:04:31,Donald Trump,"This is not campaigning. I want to make the country better I don’t care about campaigning. This is about making our country better. I think this team has been incredible, whether it’s army Corps of engineers, whether it’s Fema. One thing that happened on the call today that I noticed more than anything is Pete Gainer. So many governors that I want to thank you Pete Gainer called up they had tornadoes in a big part of our country this weekend, this week. And they were all saying that he has been unbelievable. They called one after another. They were thanking us for that’s Fema and they were thanking us. No, I want to heal this country. This is a war we’ve been through a war, we have an invisible as opposed to a visible enemy. I think in many ways the invisible enemy is much more dangerous it’s much tougher."
2020-04-16,01:05:21,Donald Trump,"In the G7 today I went through country after country. We were there we all get along great Angela Merkel and Shinzo Abe, prime minister of Japan and all of them and their countries have been devastated by this. Their economies have been devastated by this. 184 countries all over the world and we went through one after another and I was angry because it should’ve been told to us. It should have been told to us early. It should have been told to us a lot sooner. People knew it was happening and people didn’t want to talk about it. I don’t know why, but we’re going to get to the bottom of it, but people should have-"
2020-04-16,01:06:00,Unnamed,Are you referring to China or?
2020-04-16,01:06:01,Donald Trump,"I’m not saying anything. I’m saying people should have told us about this. They should have told the rest of the world too. When I looked at Germany talking today, when I looked at France talking today, the European union was there represented that represents a lot of countries. Their economies have been devastated, but they’re going to build them back. But we’re going to build this economy back bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You watch and we have stimulus and we’re going to do things, whether it’s infrastructure, which we would like to be able to do. Our roads, our tunnels, our highways, our bridges, our bridges need help. A lot of you have reported on our bridges. A lot of bridges are in bad shape they should have been fixed 25 years ago and they’re still standing. They have to be fixed, so hopefully we’ll get an infrastructure bill. The good news is the interest rate is close to zero and a zero interest is a good thing when it comes to rebuilding your infrastructure and your country back. Please in the back."
2020-04-16,01:07:01,Unnamed,"Mr president, walk us through the calendar if you would when it comes to Memorial day or even Pentecost in May, you’ve got to July 4th, labor day weekend. What would you anticipate in each of those milestones?"
2020-04-16,01:07:14,Donald Trump,"I don’t like to anticipate because you have a couple of states that are in difficulty that have made a lot of progress by the way, and they’re either here or they’re heading down. So I’m not going to go in terms of dates, but I think we’re going very quickly now I really believe. I think we’re going to have a lot of states open relatively soon. We’re beating the date, I set a date of May 1st and here we are and I think you’re going to have some nice surprises over the next few days and that’ll be before and that’s big stuff."
2020-04-16,01:07:46,Donald Trump,"Some of those states they’re big stuff, very important states and it’s going to be added on and on. Look, I don’t want anyone coming back that isn’t in position to come back. The last thing we want is for let’s say New York to come back too soon or New Jersey to come back too soon. We want them to come back when they’re ready, but they’re really heading in a good direction and I think it’ll be much faster than people think. I think it’ll be quicker, but it’s got to be safe. Yeah, please in the back"
2020-04-16,01:08:17,Unnamed,"Thank you. Has the government modeled the possibility of what might happen, how many deaths might occur if there is a widespread resurgence? If this just doesn’t work I mean, how many deaths are we talking about?"
2020-04-16,01:08:27,Donald Trump,So if we didn’t do what we did we were talking about up to 2.2 million deaths. So that’s five times almost what we lost in the civil war. Okay?
2020-04-16,01:08:39,Unnamed,Right but what about from here on out?
2020-04-16,01:08:40,Donald Trump,"If everything happens properly and if we continue to go the way we’re going now, we will be significantly less than the lowest number with mitigation. So it would be significantly less. And it’s still a lot of people, one is too many as I’ve said, one is too many. But we’ll be under the number of 100,000 which was the minimum number projected by the model. And I gave everybody up here, I gave all of the people that we’ve been working, I mean this was a military operation with a lot of private help. If you look at Roche, they were incredible. Look at Johnson and Johnson now what they’re doing, they are very far advanced on a vaccine. I think therapeutically we have some of these genius companies they are truly genius companies. I’m seeing them, I’m meeting with the people that run the companies and scientists and I mean what they’re doing is incredible, it’s incredible. It’s a beautiful thing to see. So I think we’re very far advanced and I think we’re going to be in great shape soon. Yeah please."
2020-04-16,01:09:44,Unnamed,Mr president I know you don’t want to mention specific states but what about Washington and California? Do you have guidance for-
2020-04-16,01:09:51,Donald Trump,Do you mean Washington state or Washington here?
2020-04-16,01:09:54,Unnamed,Washington State and California too.
2020-04-16,01:09:56,Donald Trump,"Well that’s going to be up to them. They’re going to have to make that determination. I mean the governor of Washington was saying that he can’t find cotton because swab is a very easy thing to get and swab essentially it’s a little bit more sophisticated than a QTIP. And you got to be able to go out and find. The federal government shouldn’t be forced to go and do everything. What we’ve done is incredible, what we’ve done are the ones that can’t be done."
2020-04-16,01:10:22,Donald Trump,"Like for instance, the ventilators that can’t be done by anybody but a very powerful, very great manufacturing country, which is what we are and what we’re really getting to be. And I have to tell you, some of these companies, the job they’ve done and we’re going to recognize them pretty soon. The job they’ve done in terms of getting out in particular ventilators because ventilators are so hard. I say and some people say, “Oh, it’s not really as complicated.” Well it’s like building a car and you know what, the price is the same too. It’s a very expensive thing for a sophisticated ventilator. It’s very, very tough stuff. Yeah please."
2020-04-16,01:11:00,Unnamed,"Mr president, let me toss this question up to you and to the doctors as well. Truthfully, for those states that aren’t ready to go to phase one to get through these phases, do we have an idea of how many millions, tens of millions of tests they’re going to need for them to get through these phases? Any number out there? Of tests of any sort?"
2020-04-16,01:11:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, so I mean you’ve heard me talk about tests for a while from the podium and I think what has happened over the last several weeks is hospitals and clinics that could move to the more point of care test move to those point of care test. And what its left is an amazing array of capacity that exists in the country for at least a million more tests per week. So we have a whole team working lab by lab to see what it would take to turn on all of those labs that aren’t running the pieces of equipment now. So you see in the system, I just said to you there’s a million more tests per week that we have tests sitting there and equipment sitting there and now we have to really deal with each single lab to really figure out what they need. And I just want to thank administrative Seema Verma who went through with us and thanks to the lab directors, they really explained to us highly technical difficulty to run some of these big pieces of equipment."
2020-04-16,01:12:29,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Because you have to alloy clot the samples, you have to centrifuge, you have to put them on the machine, takes a tech full time. At $50 a test it wasn’t enough to hire another technician to run the machine full time. So at $100 a test it is. So those are the kinds of changes we have to make bit by bit by bit. But that alone doubles our testing capacity per week. So we’re committed to work with laboratories to answer every one of their issues with the state and local governments. And I think frankly every conversation I have and the governors will say I need 5,000 people tested. And I say, well at the university of X there are 6,700 tests waiting for you. So it’s more of making sure that every governor and every public health official knows exactly where every lab is and where the test are so we can create with them a real understanding. So all these tests can be run. So yes there is twice the capacity right now."
2020-04-16,01:13:32,Donald Trump,"Just so you understand, excuse me. Just so you understand we have tremendous testing capacity. You look at the labs, they’re actually saying send us. And the reason its gone down is because we have so many other tests that frankly are easier because you don’t have to send they are onsite. And now we have the new saliva test that just came out yesterday, which is probably the easiest of them all when you get right down to it. And I was seeing where Rutgers is involved, great school, great college, great university and they’re using that. So many people are going to want to use that, but they don’t have to use the labs anymore. Labs are great, highly accurate, very, very great companies, but they’re down. As that goes down, you have additional capacity. We have tremendous testing capacity and to think that a month and a half ago we had virtually nothing. I just want to conclude we are opening up our great country again, it’s going to be over a period of time."
2020-04-16,01:14:33,Donald Trump,"We’re working with some really great people, people that have become friends of mine and I’m including Democrat governors that have really done a good job. Republican governors, most of whom I’ve known that have done a really good job. They’re all working together. We’re offered with few exceptions the relationship has been outstanding and I want to thank doctor, doctor and Mike. I want to thank the director, fantastic job. By the way, head of the FDA he has broken hurdles that years ago even recently would have taken years. He got one thing done in one day that would have taken two years for somebody else. So I want to thank Dr. Han of the FDA. We have incredible people that we’re working with and we’re going to bring our country back and it’s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. We have learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about ourselves. I want to thank everybody and most importantly, I want to thank the American people. Thank you all very much."
2020-04-16,01:15:35,Unnamed,Mr vice president Kroger grocery stores asked your personnel to be classified as secondary first responders or emergency personnel so they can get access to testing. Is that something that [inaudible 01:15:57] would be open to?
2020-04-17,02:30,Donald Trump,"Thank you. Thank you very much. I just had a great conversation with the leading faith leaders of our country. It went extremely well. We learned a lot. I learned a lot, and we’re working on some things that are very interesting, and very positive. I thank them all for being on the call. And yesterday, we unveiled detailed guidelines for America’s governors to initiate a phased, safe, and gradual reopening of America. That’s what’s happening. The guidelines provide governors with the fact-driven and science-based metrics they will need to make the decisions that are right for their own particular state. To view the guidelines, you can go to the website at Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica. So that’s Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica. Treasury has sent out economic relief payments to more than 80 million Americans who have their direct deposit information on file with the IRS. And an incredible success it has been. If you have not received your check, please visit IRS.gov/GetMyPayment. How about that one? IRS.gov/GetMyPayment. That way the IRS can get you your payment in days, and they’ve done a fantastic job, I have to say. And you won’t have to wait for a check in the mail."
2020-04-17,03:58,Donald Trump,"I have some very good news. We sent out 80 million deposits, and less than 1% had even little problems. A couple of had minor glitches, but it’s substantially less than 1%. so out of 80 million deposits, less than 1%, and that gets corrected immediately. So just please do as they say, you’ll get that very quickly, very easily. Today I’m also announcing that Secretary Perdue, who happens to be right next to me, handsome man, and the Department of Agriculture will be implementing a $19 billion relief program for our great farmers, and ranchers as they cope with the fallout of the global pandemic. Very honored to be doing this. Our farmers, ranchers, these are great people, great Americans. Never complain, they never complain. They just do what they have to do. The program will include direct payments to farmers, as well as mass purchases of dairy, meat and agricultural produce to get that food to the people in need. The USDA will receive another $14 billion in July that will have funding to continue help or helping. And this will help our farmers, and our ranches, and it’s money well deserved."
2020-04-17,05:23,Donald Trump,"So not only were they targeted at one point by China, and that was over a period of time, and you saw that happening, and they never complained, but that worked out very well. $12 billion they got, and $16 billion they got. And now it’s 19 billion. And I’m just going to ask Secretary Perdue to explain exactly how we’re going to handle it. Thank you."
2020-04-17,05:46,Sonny Perdue,"Well, Mr. President, you may remember earlier this year, you tweeted a message to our farmers and ranchers that no matter the circumstance, you pledged to stand behind them. And while none of us could ever have anticipated this type of pandemic that we’re currently in, I think today’s announcement is proof that you have our farmers’ backs, and that you will continue to do what it takes to support them, and they are very grateful. We’ve heard a lot recently, all of you about our food supply chain. I think America now knows that more than ever, that the wholesome food that our families depend upon, and starts with America’s farmers and ranchers. America agriculture has been hard hit like most of America with the Coronavirus, and President Trump is standing with our farmers and all Americans to make sure we all get through this national emergency. So today, thanks to your direction and leadership, Mr. President, USDA is announcing the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program. As you mentioned, this new $19 billion program will take several immediate actions to assist farmers, ranchers, and consumers in response to the COVID-19 national emergency. The program is really divided into two parts. One is a direct payment, $16 billion in direct payments to farmers, ranchers, and producers who’ve experienced unprecedented losses during this pandemic. Since we wanted to get the payments out to producers as quickly as possible, we decided to use the funds in the CCC. The current funds of six and a half billion dollars, combined with the 19.5 of COVID money, rather than wait for the replenishment of the CCC funds in July. Based on industry estimates of damage, Mr. President, it is becoming apparent that we’ll need the additional CCC funds as we continue to track the economic losses. Secondly, and this is really important as well, the USDA will be purchasing $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy, and meat products to be distributed to Americans in need through our food bank networks, as well as other community and faith-based organizations."
2020-04-17,07:59,Sonny Perdue,"Having to dump milk, or plow under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing, but it’s heartbreaking as well to those who produce them. This program will not only provide direct financial relief to our farmers and ranchers, Mr. President, but will allow for the purchase and distribution of our agricultural abundance in this country to help our fellow Americans in need. So in recent weeks we’ve seen, all of us have seen the heroic patriotism of our food supply chain workers, and they’ve shown day in and day out doing the work to serve the needs of fellow Americans."
2020-04-17,08:32,Sonny Perdue,"Our farmers have been in the fields planting, and doing what they do every spring to feed the American people. Even with the pandemic, as we speak. I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your unwavering support. They want to thank you for your unwavering support, for America’s farmers and ranchers. And I want to commit you, Mr. President, and to the American people that USDA will do everything in our power to implement this program as quickly and as efficiently as possible to help our farmers, ranchers, producers, and consumers during this great time of need. So thank you very much for having me here today. And God bless you. God bless America. God bless American agriculture. Thank you."
2020-04-17,09:09,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, thank you very much. Thank you Sonny. So our great secretary of agriculture was the governor of Georgia for eight years. And the only reason he isn’t still there, frankly, is that he was term-limited. And I said, let’s get him for agriculture, and you’ve done a fantastic job. We want to thank you very much. Eight years at Georgia. We really appreciate it. Great job. Even as we prepare to rebuild our economy, America continues to wage a all-out medical war to defeat the invisible enemy. To date, we have conducted more than 3.78 million Coronavirus tests, by far the most of any country. It’s not even close. In the hardest hit areas such as New York and Louisiana, we’ve also tested more people per capita than South Korea, Singapore, and every other country. The United States has the most robust, advanced, and accurate testing system anywhere in the world. As of yesterday, we have distributed nearly 660,000 Abbott IDs. Now that’s an incredible test. It’s called the ID Now point of care diagnostic test, and it’s fantastic. It’s the hot one. Problem with this business is it’s the hot one until about two days from now. Because we do have a saliva test that just came out, and that can be self-administered, and it’s said to be fantastic. I want to thank Abbott Laboratories. They have been incredible. I want to thank Roche. They’ve likewise been incredible. Over the last several days, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests conducted by hospitals and academic institutions, which have now performed nearly 600,000 tests. There’s a tremendous amount of unused capacity in the states available for governors to tap. We have tremendous unused capability within those laboratories, and I hope the governors are going to be able to use them. The governors are responsible for testing, and I hope they’re going to be able to use this tremendous amount of available capacity that we have. It’s up to one million additional tests per week."
2020-04-17,11:28,Donald Trump,"When you think of that, in the next few weeks, we’ll be sending out 5.5 million testing swabs to the state. Swabs can be done easily by the governors themselves. Mostly it’s cotton. It’s not a big deal. You can get cotton easily, but if they can’t get it, we will take care of it. Yesterday the FDA announced a new collaboration with United Health Group, the Gates Foundation, Quantagen, and US Cotton to greatly expand the supply of essential swabs, including a new polyester Q-tip-type swab for the Coronavirus testing. All of these actions will help our testing capability continue to grow dramatically. So we’re helping people. Even with swabs, we get ventilators. We’re now the the king of ventilators. We have hundreds of thousands under construction. We don’t need them ourselves. The governors are in great shape. If we do, we have a great stockpile that we’ll immediately send to the state in need, but we’ve handled that situation incredibly well. I hope people understand it."
2020-04-17,12:37,Donald Trump,"I wish the media would get the word out. What we’ve done in ventilators is amazing, because they’re big, expensive, and highly complex. We’re speaking to other countries. I spoke to President of Mexico today, great gentlemen, and I told him that we are going to be helping him out with ventilators, helping Mexico out. And we’ll be helping some other countries too. We have a lot of very high-level, high quality ventilators, and they’re here, and they’re also being manufactured as we speak. Following the announcement of our re-opening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacity. It’s totally false and misleading. Demonstrating a complete failure to understand the enormous scope of the testing capabilities that we’ve brought online. And we started really from ground zero. We started from really being very, very outdated and obsolete, as a country, from the past, and I will say this, if they didn’t understand it, it’s just really, unfortunately, I hate to say this, because we’ve been getting along very well, but it would be false reporting, because they understand the capability."
2020-04-17,13:53,Donald Trump,"And it’s going to be up to the states to use that capability. The states have local points where they can go. A governor can call the mayors, and the mayors can call representatives, and everything is perfect. And that’s the way it should work, and always should work. We’ll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing. We have to get even better, and some people think a little bit differently. There are areas where you have vast amounts of area where you have very few people, and almost no people are infected. And those places will be looked upon differently by different governors, and I think you’re going to have a lot of news coming out about that over the next few days. I think certain states are going to come online, and they’re going to start the early stages of the puzzle that we’re putting together, and it’s going to be together sooner rather than later."
2020-04-17,14:48,Donald Trump,"A lot of really incredible things are happening. And at some point in the not too distant future, we’re going to have our country back, and it’s going to be, I think really with what we’re doing on stimulus and helping people keep their businesses together, and their lives together, and their jobs. It’s going to be better than ever before. I hope so. I really do. The current conversation is reminiscent of what happened on ventilators. You remember that. When requests were made, far beyond what was objectively needed, we were hearing from a certain state, and we were hearing from a lot that they needed far more ventilators. In one case they wanted 40,000 ventilators, 40,000. It turned out that they had plenty, and they had a number of about seven or 8,000, and that was plenty. We supplied them with a lot, but that was the right number. We got it just about right. And if they did need more, we’re ready to give more. But I think the surge seems to be over, and there are a lot of governors just doing a great job. And they’re working with us, but we’re all working together."
2020-04-17,15:58,Donald Trump,"The research and development that we’ve done at the federal level has been absolutely incredible. The media will be accepting of these figures when they get to see the end result. I think they’re going to see it, and I think they’re already seeing it. That includes not only ventilators, but beds. We built, in most cases, far more than they even needed. But we wanted to err on the side of caution. This is what the governors wanted. They wanted a certain amount in Louisiana. I spoke with the governor, had a long talk with him, and I said, “Do you think you’ll need that final hospital?” And they actually didn’t need it. We built a lot of beds, so I appreciate it from the governor. And we saved building a hospital in New York. We did, I think just a spectacular job at the Javits Center, and even sending the ship up became, we brought it into COVID, but they didn’t really need, it. It didn’t get much use, but it was there and ready."
2020-04-17,16:59,Donald Trump,"It wasn’t supposed to be used for that purpose. We changed it into that purpose, and it was there, ready, willing and able. Same with Javits, but they didn’t quite need the beds that we produced. So we produced almost 2,900 beds. And I think I’d rather tell you that we were over-prepared than we were under-prepared. And that was a good faith effort by New York. I have to say that. A very good faith effort, but it’s nice that we didn’t need that instead of needing it. It was not very occupied. But it was ready to go. It’s still there should something happen, but I think they have it under very good control. As you’ll hear from our experts today, we’ve already built sufficient testing capacity nationwide for states to begin their reopenings, and I think you’ll be hearing a lot about reopenings in the coming weeks and months. Most excitingly in the coming weeks, I think you’re going to see some very, very dramatic steps taken, and very safely. We’re putting safety first. We may be opening, but we’re putting safety first."
2020-04-17,18:11,Donald Trump,"And when you look at the numbers, when you look at the possible number of deaths at 2.2 million people, and it could have very well been that. It could have been more. Frankly, I’ve been looking at numbers where it could have been higher than that. 2.2 million people dying. If you figure we lost 500, 000, maybe 600,000 in the Civil War, 2.2 million people, a minimum, if we did nothing would have been 1.6. If you cut that in half, you’re talking about 800,000, 900,000, a million people dying, but we did a lot of work, and the people of this country were incredible, I have to say. And I think we’re heading to the other category. And that would be if we did work, and if it was successful, they had between 100,000 and 220,000, to 240, 000 on the upside. And I think we’ll be substantially hopefully below the hundred number. And I think right now we’re heading it probably around 60, maybe 65,000. And one is too many. I always say it, one is too many. This is a horrible thing that happened to our country."
2020-04-17,19:19,Donald Trump,"This is a horrible thing that happened to 184 countries, all over the world, it’s a horrible thing and there was no reason for it. It should never ever happen again. In a few minutes, you will be hearing from Dr. Redfield, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Burks, and Admiral Giroir to explain these facts in really great detail. Earlier this week, the FDA authorized two new antibody tests, which is very exciting, that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the virus, bringing the total to four authorized antibody tests already. This will help us assess the number of cases that have been asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic. And support our efforts to get Americans back to work by showing us who might have developed the wonderful, beautiful immunity. Ultimate victory in this war will be made possible by America’s scientific brilliance. There is nothing like us. There is nobody like us, not even close. I wish I could tell you stories what other countries, even powerful countries say to me, the leaders, and they say it quietly, and they say it off the record, but they have great respect for what we can do."
2020-04-17,20:35,Donald Trump,"And our country is at a point, a few weeks ago, think of it, four or five weeks ago, we were at a level that nobody had ever attained, the best job numbers we’ve ever had, the best economy we’ve ever had. Every company virtually was doing better business than ever before. The stock market was at all time highs, and then one day they said, you got to close it up, and we did the right thing. We saved maybe millions of lives by doing it the way we did it, but we’re paying a price, but that price is very unimportant compared to the number of lives we’re talking about. The NIH and others are conducting clinical trials of 35 different therapies and treatments. Therapies being so exciting to me, because that’s really like if something happens, you’re going to get better, reasonably quickly, and without such a horrible deal as some people have to go through. To that end today, NIH announced that it is launching a public-private partnership with more than a dozen biopharmaceutical companies, their HHS, FDA, CDC and the European Medicines agency. They’re all working together."
2020-04-17,21:52,Donald Trump,"We’re working together with a lot of other countries. The partnership will marshal and coordinate the vast resources, knowledge, assets and authorities of more than a dozen organizations and agencies to accelerate development of the most promising therapies and vaccines. The vaccines are coming along really, really well. Johnson and Johnson is very well advanced, and one thing is, we’re having great, great success, but we have to test them, and it takes a long period of time. It takes probably over a year, unfortunately, but therapy’s likewise are coming along very, very well. Therapies are immediate. When we get that, that’ll be a big day. We’re also equipping our medical warriors on the front lines. In total, we have the Project Airbridge, and the Airbridge has been incredible. The National Strategic Stockpile, and every other channel the federal government has deployed. If you think about this, 44.5 million N95 masks, nearly 524 million gloves, 63.5 million surgical masks, and more than 10 million gowns, and we have 500 million masks coming in very soon, between manufacturing and orders. 500 million masks. The last few months have been among the most challenging times in the history of our nation."
2020-04-17,23:21,Donald Trump,"This invisible enemy is tough, and it’s smart, and it’s vicious, but every day we’re getting closer to the future that we all had been waiting for. I talk about the light at the end of the tunnel. We are getting very, very close to seeing that light shine very brightly at the end of that tunnel. And it’s happening, and I want to thank everybody in the room. I actually want to thank some of the media. We’ve had some fair coverage, some really fair coverage, and I appreciate it. What I’m going to do is I’m going to introduce our great Vice President, Mike Pence, and he’s going to take over for a little while. I’m going to leave, and I’m coming right back, and we’ll take some questions. They’re going to go over our tremendous testing capabilities, and again, I’ll be right back. Thank you. Thank you very much."
2020-04-17,24:20,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President, and good afternoon, all. Today, as the president just reflected, it remains a challenging time in the life of our nation. But because of the extraordinary efforts of the American people, because of the strong partnership the federal government has forged with states across the country, we’re making progress America. Despite the tragic loss of more than 36,000 Americans, according to our best data reporting this morning, we continue to see new cases low and steady on the West coast, and we continue to see cases and hospitalizations declining. In the greater New York City area, in New Orleans, and Detroit, and elsewhere. This is a tribute first and foremost to our healthcare doctors, nurses, all of those working on the front lines, but it’s also a great tribute to the American people who have put into practice the social distancing, the guidelines, the guidance of state and local officials. And we hope that every American is encouraged by the steady progress that we are making."
2020-04-17,25:41,Mike Pence,"We’re continuing to bring at the president’s direction, the full resources of the federal government to bear. Today, the president approved a major disaster declaration for American Samoa, and now all 50 states, and all territories are under major disaster declarations for the first time in American history. At this present moment, 33,000 national guardsmen are on duty. 5,500 active duty military personnel had been deployed to nine states, including 716 medical professionals, doctors and nurses who deployed out to 14 different hospitals today. Among those were 10 hospitals in New York City, and military personnel were also serving today in hospitals in Connecticut, Texas, Louisiana, and New Jersey. Yesterday, as the president reflected, we unveiled the president’s guidelines for opening up America again. There were two parts at the beginning of those guidelines. First, the criteria that we hope will guide governors in their decisions about reopening their states on either a statewide level, or a county level. And then also we outlined what we believe would be the most important state responsibilities to have in place before moving…"
2020-04-17,27:03,Mike Pence,"Important state responsibilities to have in place before moving into a reopening plan. For phase one the president’s guidelines you’ll recall advise that states that have a downward trajectory in cases over a 14 day period of time and ensure that they have proper capacity in their health care facilities could move to phase one with the easing of some of the social distancing and the criteria that had been in place. But for states that meet the criteria, we outlined specific responsibilities, protecting workers in critical industries, particularly protecting the most vulnerable, those who live and work in senior care facilities. And we also encourage states to have a plan a for testing symptomatic individuals and ensuring testing to our most vulnerable populations. As the president has made clear, governors will decide the time and manner that their states reopen and we will look to support them in that effort."
2020-04-17,28:05,Mike Pence,"But as we assured the American people yesterday, the president’s direction, our administration will continue to work with governors across the country to ensure that they have the equipment and the supplies and the testing resources to reopen safely and responsibly. On the subject of supplies, today we issued a letter to our nation’s governors summarizing all the medical equipment and supplies that have been distributed to their state from Fema between the first of this month and April 14th through project Air bridge and through the commercial supply network. We’ll be speaking with our nation’s governors on Monday and detailing that information at that time. As of April 16th as the president reflected briefly, Fema has coordinated the delivery of millions of pieces of medical equipment including 44 million N95 respirators, 63 million surgical masks, more than 10,000 ventilators and of course deployed more than 8,600 federal medical station beds."
2020-04-17,29:06,Mike Pence,"On the subject of testing resources we’re going to take some time to speak about our administration’s approach in partnership with states to continue to expand testing across the country at this briefing. But from the very outset of this epidemic, president Trump made efforts to essentially reinvent testing in America. The traditional testing in this country that takes place at CDC or at state labs was designed for basically the kind of diagnostic testing that is routinely required. But the president early on in this effort brought together the leading commercial labs in America. We forged a public and private partnership and six weeks ago we had performed some 25,000 tests and at this day we have performed 3.7 million tests. We believe that labs and hospitals are now performing more than 120,000 tests a day. And we’ve actually stood up a team from Walter Reed under the direction of Dr. Deborah Birx that is working around the clock to identify additional testing capacity across the country."
2020-04-17,30:16,Mike Pence,"We believe that states could actually more than double the amount of daily testing that is happening today by simply activating all of the labs and Dr. Birx will detail some of those resources today and we’ll be going over those very specifically with governors on Monday. We’ve also been promoting the development of new and innovative tests. We all know about the 15 minute Abbott test, but the FDA is currently working on an antibody test that literally could add 20 million new tests to our supply even before the end of April. I want to assure the American people that we’re going to continue to work with your governors and with your state health officials to scale testing in the days ahead. But as you’ll hear from all of our experts tonight, our best scientists and health experts assess that states today have enough tests to implement the criteria of phase one if they choose to do so."
2020-04-17,31:17,Mike Pence,"Let me say that again. Given the guidance in the president’s new guidelines for opening up America again, states that meet the criteria for going into phase one and then are preparing the testing that is contemplated by going to phase one. Our best scientists and health experts assess that today we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of a phase one reopening if state governors should choose to do that. And you’ll hear more detail on that in just a moment. At the president’s direction, we’re going to be presenting an outline of our approach to testing in partnership with states during this briefing. Our approach will continue to be locally executed, state managed and federally supported. Dr Fauci will give us a brief introduction to the overall approach to testing that is contemplated to deal with the coronavirus. Dr. Redfield of the CDC will describe our plan to mobilize CDC officials in all 50 States to specifically monitor coronavirus incidents that occur in every state in the union."
2020-04-17,32:28,Mike Pence,"Of course Dr. Deborah Birx will describe not only our tests but also the current capability and the capability that we could expand to very readily. And Admiral Gerard of the US public health service will summarize our approach. But I want to assure the American people that at the president’s direction we are going to continue to work every single day to make sure that our states and communities have the testing they need to reopen at the time and manner of their choosing. And we’re going to work every day to make sure our states have the resources and the supplies to reopen their states and reopen America in a safe and responsible way. With that, Dr. Fauci."
2020-04-17,33:17,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much Mr vice president. So as the vice president said, I’m going to give you a brief introduction to kind of answer the question that we’ve been asked a lot. In fact, we had a very productive teleconference with the Senate democratic caucus just a few hours ago and they asked a number of questions which were really reasonable questions. Questions that are on the mind of a lot of different people. And one of them was the question that was just posed a moment ago is are there enough tests to allow us to be able to go through this first phase in a way that is protective of the health and the safety of the American people? So I just want to spend a couple of minutes clarifying a few things and maybe providing some information on a broad 40,000 foot, which you’ll hear some of the more granular details from my colleagues who will be following me."
2020-04-17,34:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I think they asked me to give the 40,000 foot one because I’m not a testing person. I didn’t run a testing lab, but I’m part of a team that is looking at this of how we can best make sure this happens in the right way. So first of all, let me say something that we’ve said before and I apologize if I’m repeating things that you already know but I think in some respects it’s important to do that so that people have clarity in what we’re talking about. There are two general types of tests even though within each general type there are different subgroups. One of them is to actually test for the infection, is a person infected? The other, and I’ll get back to that in a second. The other is to test as we just mentioned, if someone has been infected. Usually someone has been infected who has recovered and as I’ll get to in a moment that you could assume although we need to do some more work on that, that that person is actually protected against subsequent exposure and infection with an identical organism."
2020-04-17,35:17,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So what are some of the pluses and minuses of each? Because the pluses and minuses are really going to impact how we best use the test and how the tests actually should be used. So let’s take the test for whether or not you’re infected. The test of whether or not you’re infected is a test that right now is called the nucleic acid test. It’s not an easy test to do. There are some that are more rapid. There were some that have a high throughput, there are different groups within that. The good news about that is that it’s a sensitive and specific test so that if you’re infected you know you’re infected, so that as I’ll get to in a moment, if you need to do something with that, get that person, put them in care, take care of them, get them out of circulation that’s important."
2020-04-17,36:10,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"The part about that that I think is often misunderstood is that if you get a test today like I did today, it’s negative. If you get a test today, that does not mean that tomorrow or the next day or the next day or the next day as you get exposed, perhaps from someone who may not even know they’re infected that that means that I’m negative. Which means if you take that to its extreme in order to be really sure, you would almost have to test somebody either every day or every other day or every week or what it is to be absolutely certain, that’s an issue. Now, the problem that I talk about when I try and compare this to other situations with what testing means to you I’m as I think most people know have been involved in HIV/AIDS for 38 years, 39 years from the very first week of HIV. So that’s what I do."
2020-04-17,37:16,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"If you get a test for HIV and you are negative and you do not practice any risk behaviors, you can be guaranteed that next month, six months, one year from now, you will be negative if you don’t have a risk behavior. So there’s a big difference there about what testing actually means. So the point I think you’re getting is that although there is clearly a place for needing to test somebody for a given reason, a test means you’re negative now. Now, the other test is an antibody test, a test that tells you in fact that you’ve been infected. That’s really good you’re going to hear a little bit about that from my colleagues in a moment because that will give you a broader view of two things. One, what the penetrance of the infection had been. And number two, you can make an assumption though we still need to prove that."
2020-04-17,38:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"I mean we’re assuming that if you’re infected and you have antibody, you’re protected and I think that’s a reasonable assumption based on our experience with other viruses. But what we want to make sure that we know and these are some of the challenges, what is the tighter that is protective? How long is the protection? Is it one month? Is it three months? Is it six months? It’s a year, so we need to be humble and modest that we don’t know everything about it, but it really is an important test. The other thing is the difference between testing and monitoring out there, what’s out there? The difference between what we really needed for for phase one is to be able to identify, isolate contact trace. A very important part of when you’re pulling back gradually and slowly on the mitigation and you have people who might be infected, you want to know they’re infected, you want to put them in care that is something that we absolutely need to do."
2020-04-17,39:13,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"But there are other ways, I want to make sure that people understand that not to underestimate the importance of testing. Testing is a part, an important part of a multifaceted way that we are going to control and ultimately end this outbreak. So please don’t anyone interpret it that I’m down pressing testing, but the emphasis that we’ve been hearing is essentially testing is everything and it isn’t. It’s the kinds of things that we’ve been doing, the mitigation strategies that are important part of that. Now, just a couple of things before I hand it over to my colleagues. No doubt, no doubt that early on we had a problem. I have publicly said that we had a problem early on. There was a problem that had to be corrected and it was corrected. It was a problem that was a technical problem from within that was corrected and it was an issue of embracing the way we have now and should have the private sector who clearly has the capability of making and providing tests at the level that we will need them for any of the things that I’ve just spoken about."
2020-04-17,40:29,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So having said that right now I totally understand and I am not alone my colleagues understand that although we say there are X number of tests out there and you’re going to hear from Admiral Gerard about that. The fact is there have been and still are situations that are correctable and will be corrected and some of which have been corrected. I know I get on the phone a lot with my colleagues because believe it or not, some long time ago I was where they are in the hospitals in the emergency room looking at very sick individuals that you need to take care of. And I know what it means when someone tells you, “Hey, you have what you need.” And you look around and you say, “Well, maybe you think I have what I need, but I don’t really have what I need.” So we have to figure out how do we close that gap."
2020-04-17,41:26,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And there are a lot of things that I think we’ve learned and that we are correcting and going to correct. Namely, you have a situation where tests are needed and appropriated and either people have found there’s no tests or there’s no reagents or there’s no swabs or a person needed a test and were told that there was a restriction, they couldn’t get a test. These are all the things that I’m telling you already know because you’ve heard them. So right now or there’s a delay of five to seven days and what does that mean if you want to get somebody at a circulation? We understand that that existed, but upon careful examination what you are going to hear that many of those have been already corrected and other of those will be corrected. Because what I think people don’t appreciate through no fault of their own is that there are two issues. There’s supply and demand and if you have a supply that can meet the demand, but the supply is not connected to demand then supply demand falls apart."
2020-04-17,42:41,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"What do I mean by that? I mean there is existing capacity that we have that for one reason or other maybe has not been fully communicated as to the availability of that existing capacity and you’re going to hear about that now. There’s production capacity that gets better and better and better. And that’s what we’re talking about because for what we need now, we believe that with better communications we’ll be able to make that happen. So I know there’s going to be a lot of questions about that. I didn’t want to go on too long, but let me just finish by saying, given what I just said and what I believe what you’re going to hear that for what we need in the first phase, if these things are done correctly what I believe they can, we will have and there will be enough tests to allow us to take this country safely through phase one. Thank you."
2020-04-17,43:43,Mike Pence,Thank you too. Dr. Redfield.
2020-04-17,43:43,Dr. Redfield,"Thank you Mr. Vice-president. I want to make a few comments here. First I want to talk a little bit about CDC has developed multiple systems to monitor disease outbreaks. I think many of you are familiar for example, how we monitor for foodborne illness or how we monitor for antibiotic resistance in hospitals. Well, we’ve also developed a system to monitor for upper respiratory tract disease. If I can get the first slide there. This is an example because when we talk about what we know about this current pandemic, the reality is we know a lot because we’ve developed these monitoring systems. Up on the slide is a system that we’ve developed initially for flu and what it does as you can see there’s a multiple different flu seasons and they track them over the course of a year. I want you to look at the red line and that happens to be this year’s respiratory season."
2020-04-17,44:44,Dr. Redfield,"And you see there is a peak there up over the 50, 52 week and that peak was when we actually had a peak of influenza B. This year was a little different because after that viral syndrome came down and you can see it that actually we had another peak and that’s when influenza A was active through our country. And you can see influenza A started to drop, but then you saw a third peak. That peak was you were looking at the coronavirus 19 so we had systems all the way down to the County level that we can see where there’s respiratory tract illness. And so it’s not just just taking a test it’s monitoring these systems that have been developed over the last over decades. And we have multiple ones, we have another one this that is monitored in emergency rooms looking at syndrome diagnosis and they show the same thing."
2020-04-17,45:47,Dr. Redfield,"So we’re well equipped to monitor to see when respiratory track viral disease will come and becomes a very good surrogate for when you can begin to understand that we need to start looking more ideologically about what’s going on. You can see now in week 15 we’re really coming down to the baseline background in terms of our flu surveillance system from the overall coronavirus situation right now. The second thing I wanted to say is that CDC continues to enhance the state’s public health capacity to accelerate their ability as Tony talked about. It’s critical as we open America again to diagnose individuals that present with influenza like illness or coronavirus like illness, to diagnose them to be able to isolate them and to be able to contact trace around them and then diagnose the contacts and those that are coronavirus positive to go back and do their contacts."
2020-04-17,46:56,Dr. Redfield,"This is the traditional public health approach, which was started in this outbreak in January and February and was quite successful when as I mentioned before, through February 27th this country only had 14 cases. We did that isolation and that contact tracing and it was very successful, but then when the virus more exploded got beyond the public health capacity. But right now CDC is enhancing that public health capacity."
2020-04-17,47:25,Dr. Redfield,"And if I can get the second slide, I want to show you that this is just showing as we sit here today, that CDC has embedded in these health departments and all of these states across this country more than 500 individuals. We also have an additional almost a hundred individuals that are working on more than 20 coronavirus outbreaks that are going through all these states. And finally at the direction of the president, we’ve been asked to further enhance this deployment in each of the states as the vice president said, so that there’s additional public health personnel to help accelerate the state’s ability to basically move forward aggressively and we assist them so they can operationalize the president’s guidelines to open up America again. So I just wanted to make those points for you today."
2020-04-17,48:19,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Dr. Birx."
2020-04-17,48:24,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr. Vice president and thank you Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield for all of that clarity. If we can have the next slide and I’m going to go back to what Dr. Fauci was talking about just to emphasize those points about the two types of tests and I’m going to talk about a third one. So first we all know about sampling in the front of your nose to all of the labs out there and to the providers you don’t have to use the nasal pharyngeal swab anymore. You can do front of nose sampling. And again, as Dr. Fauci talked about is that is sampling for the virus itself that replicates in your nose and as we know throughout some of the respiratory tissues. The second test is of course then your immune response to that infection that’s in your nose. And so that’s the antibody test."
2020-04-17,49:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,And so those are the two tests we want to talk about. But I want to come back to something that both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield said and we covered yesterday. Testing is a part of the exquisite monitoring that needs to occur in partnership with CDC and state and local governments utilizing the surveillance systems that are available. What we just talked about the flu surveillance system because we no longer have flu and the syndromic respiratory system that is across the United States. And you can see it’s going back to baseline so that we’ll be able to see at the community level any deviation from that baseline. In addition what we talked about yesterday was adding that asymptomatic component because I think you’ll see as more and more articles come out for surveillance and monitoring that other states have done higher and higher antibody in multiple individuals who don’t remember having a sickness.
2020-04-17,50:16,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And that will give us an idea that’s our asymptomatic monitoring in these Sentinel monitoring sites. And what did we talk about yesterday? We talked about nursing homes, we talked about indigenous people and we talked about vulnerable people in the inner city. Really ensuring that something that is so small that can’t even be seen on the surveillance monitoring will be able to be seen in the asymptomatic. And so those are the two tests that we have. One available now, two that have been approved or three by the FDA. I want to just leave you with my last concept on the antibody tests. Antibody tests have different specificity and sensitivities. The FDA has been very cautious about the antibody tests because I know you see reports every day of countries that have ordered the antibody test and found that they were 50, 60, 70% faulty. So we’re taking that very seriously because you never want to tell someone that they have an antibody and potential immunity when they don’t."
2020-04-17,51:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so those tests perform better when there’s a high prevalence or a high incidence of disease. So we want to work with mayors around the United States as those antibody tests become available to really see what it is in first responders and healthcare workers in the highest prevalence states so that we can know about the quality and the real life, real field experience of those assays. Because things can look very good in the lab and then when you take them into the field sometimes they’re not as good. I’ve learned this lesson repeatedly in working around the globe. The next slide. So this is what we have asked commercial and diagnostic companies to be working on. Because when you talk about multi-millions worth of tests, the way we do this in the United States today for strep, for influenza and for malaria is we test for the antigen."
2020-04-17,52:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Now, we don’t know right now is you shed antigen in the front of your nose. And so that is the question that scientists and companies are working on right now. Because that becomes a simpler test. Now, the flu test I think many of you will look it up tonight. You will see that outside of the flu season, because of the specificity of the test, it doesn’t work so well. So these are tests we’re working on today that would be like a screening test because if you’re positive on it, it’s a good test. But it may miss that you actually have the flu. So then you would move into what we call the nucleic acid test. So we’re trying to build an algorithm of tests that bring the full talent of the science of the United States into the reality of the clinic and so bench to clinic."
2020-04-17,53:19,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so this is what we’re working on for the future. Next slide. So as I promised on both the senators and the governors, this is the United States current platform capacity. Designated as high and low throughput. And what do I mean by that? There’s we’ve talked about the high throughput platforms of Roche and Abbott and others. And then we’ve talked about the gene expert and other machines that may be moderate to lower throughput. I want you to see how it’s distributed through the United States. So these are the current testing platforms available today throughout the United States for COVID-19. And as you heard from Dr. Fauci everything has-"
2020-04-17,54:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And as you heard from Dr. Fauci, everything has to be working from the swab to the transport media to the laboratory to really get those tests run and the results back to the client. The next slide. So, then we’ve looked at all of the testing capacity from those platforms and this gives you an idea of what that capacity is. The darkest red that you could see like in Texas and New York. Those are states that have lots of different platforms, as you saw on the prior slide and the ability, if you just add up the platforms and the potential for tests, of over a million tests per month. And so, this is what we’re working with each of those States on unlocking that full potential. And how are we doing that? Well, we’re calling on the American Society of Microbiologists. They work closely with 300 lab directors around the country. We talked with them this morning. And the Walter Reed team who develop the entire HIV testing program for the military 35 years ago, called them back into service and they’re calling lab by lab to find out what are the technical difficulties to bring up all the platforms that exist in your lab."
2020-04-17,55:18,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Is it swaps, is it transport media, is it extraction? And I just really want to thank them. They’ve already worked through over 70+ of those laboratories to really understand, and the American Society of Microbiologists and the academic societies of the laboratories are working together to ensure that all of this potential can be unlocked. Next slide, please. We talked a little bit yesterday about new Orleans and the president talked about how many tests New Orleans has done during its outbreak, which you can see now is waning. They’ve done throughout the last month, 27 tests per 1000 New Orleans and Louisianians."
2020-04-17,56:02,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, 27 per 1000. So, that is a good mark. And that’s what Italy has done about 20 per 1000. So, in evaluating an outbreak and really to get control of this outbreak, they did about 27 tests per 1000. So, using that as a measure, next slide, we then looked at across all the states of the United States of America and looked for states that had ability to do 30 or more tests per 1000 of their habitats in each state. And you can see that across the country except for Oregon and Maine and…"
2020-04-17,56:47,Mike Pence,Montana.
2020-04-17,56:49,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Montana. I worked overseas way too long. Thank you all. So, those are the three states that we’re working on building capacity in. So, this is just to give you a perspective of how seriously we’re taking the testing issue. As we’ve described, we measured every single platform in every single state. We know exactly where they are by geography, by address, by zip code, what their capacity is, what their cumulative capacity is, what their roadblocks are on not ability to run all their full capacity. And we’re addressing those because each one of those is different and you have to address each of them one by one with the governors, with the state and local labs, and with all of the hospitals."
2020-04-17,57:32,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I have not come across one laboratory or one laboratory director or one society that doesn’t want to contribute to solving this issue of testing and ensuring that this testing is available for everyone. There is a strong, just as all the Americans have social distanced, in behind everyone. We don’t often talk about the laboratories, we’ll talk about the nurses and doctors on the front line. Behind all of them are the laboratory technicians and laboratory directors who are coming in every day and putting things together to ensure that every single person that needs to be diagnosed is diagnosed. And hopefully you can see from these slides that really there is capacity out there. It is our job working with the states and having the state in the leadership role and the laboratory directors in the leadership role to provide support to ensure that all the potential for testing in the United States is brought to bear. I just want to end with these are nucleic acid tests. There will never be the ability on a nucleic acid test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school, but there might be with the antigen test. And so, that’s why there’s a role for nucleic acid test. There’s a role for antibody test and there’s a role for the future development of these other key tests to bring the full ability to the United States. And so, when we finish this, we’ll be talking to all Americans because there’s other tests that other Americans should have. And I think this has really brought to light the importance of diagnosis, and we’ll talk to you further about hepatitis C and TB and other things that we can do to ensure that every American is healthy. Because I think this has really raised the awareness among all Americans about how you do tests for different kinds and different parts of your disease state, and what is long lasting immunity and what may be long lasting immunity, and what does a nucleic acid test and what an antigen test is. And with that, Admiral Gerard."
2020-04-17,59:38,Mike Pence,And let me amplify one point as the Admiral steps forward to included remarks about our approach and the efforts we put under way…
2020-04-17,59:49,Brett Giroir,"If you’ve got to screen a few thousand people, four tests an hour doesn’t get you there on a machine. You have to use some of the larger, higher throughput items, but they have a very important role. And again, coming into the market at 50,000 per day is really an important adjunct to us. She talked about the gene expert from [inaudible 00:06:10], very important. We don’t talk about that very much, but it is one of the backbone mobile point of care. Not as easy to do per se as the Abbott, but it is a point of care test that really carries tuberculosis screening all through Africa. There are these machines, you saw that on her slide, every one of the 50 states has this at over 600 sites and they’ve done over 700,000 tests just on that relatively low throughput but very important platform. Next slide, please."
2020-04-17,01:00:44,Brett Giroir,"I wanted to give you an idea of how the tests are distributed and how they’re changing over time. On the left are the state public health laboratories and although their numbers are relatively small, about 350,000, the state public health laboratories are absolutely critical. They’re an absolutely critical core component of our testing. Not only were they there early and first, but they also do things like support outbreak investigations in nursing homes or investigations in certain plants that have a close proximity with everyone because of their work environments. They also do testing on many people who do not have the opportunity to be tested elsewhere, and they are performing outstandingly well. ACLA. I know we hate acronyms, but the American Clinical Laboratory Association, this is America’s commercial industrial backbone that were standing behind the president and the vice president and when I was there a few weeks ago in the rose garden. This is the lab core, the quest, the BioReference Laboratory, Mayo, Sonic and ARUP. And you’ll see they’ve done almost 2.3 million tests."
2020-04-17,01:01:54,Brett Giroir,"This is the very large high throughput machines that Dr. Birx talks about and I want to be clear about this group is that it doesn’t matter where you are. I just took one of the largest labs and I said, “Map out for me within 10 miles of where you are, every site in the country.” And when you do that, within 10 miles of a site of one of these, 93% of the US population is covered. These are truly national reference labs that cover almost everybody within the United States. So, if you cannot get a test at your hospital, the chances are overwhelming that you could send this to these labs that are fully caught up now. They have no backlog of tests. They’ve ramped up their production, so their turnaround time is about 48 hours because you may need to transport it from the middle of America out to a lab and result that, but that’s really very good."
2020-04-17,01:02:54,Brett Giroir,"The American Hospital Association. Also, academic labs. As the vice president and the president have said, as more and more labs come online, they’re increasing the amount of testing that are done just at the hospitals or at academic medical centers. Now, almost at 600,000 tests, and again matching the other slide I had. The Abbott point of care test, just to give you a distribution. And that point of care test is being used very importantly in very select populations where a point of care test is really needed. That could be in some hospitals where someone needs to know exactly if a person is positive or not to go on a clinical trial or in a nursing home investigation or sometimes to get people screened to go back into the work environment. Most people don’t need a point of care test. In fact, the point of care test cannot replace the millions of tests that are here on the other side. Next slide."
2020-04-17,01:03:53,Brett Giroir,"I don’t know how interested you are in swabs. I did not know a whole lot of swabs before a few weeks ago, but there’s two points I want to make with these slides is yes, there have been constraining elements. And they’re.Constrained for a couple reasons. Number one, because this is an unprecedented scale up of this type of very sophisticated molecular test that has never put a demand on the system like we have. When we started out a few weeks ago, there’s very specific one type of swab, only get at one place in the US, one place in Italy and we were stuck with that for a while because it’s not just the quantity, it’s the quality. What I don’t want to do is put a lot of things in the system to make people believe that this is a good test when it hasn’t been validated by the FDA, to say that a positive is a positive and a negative is a negative. But over the past weeks, both the scientific community, the Gates Foundation, academic medical centers, the FDA have really opened up our ability to not stick that all the way back in your nasal pharynx but do the anterior nose and to greatly broaden the amount of swab types that are available. So, we are really at a point right now that by the end of April, we’ll put another 5 million swabs in addition to everything that’s out there now and by the end of May, over 12 million new swabs in the system. More than enough to obtain the capacity that we need. Next slide. For these molecular tests, you take a swab and you stick it in a test tube and that test tube has to have a specific kind of liquid in it. And when we started it was viral transport media, a very special kind of media. The CDC has a make your own recipe. If you’re interested in cooking, you could probably do that, but it has a lot of ingredients that go in there, but still very limiting. We’ve worked with many different laboratories. We’ve worked with the FDA, so now PBS, phosphate buffered saline, just a laboratory grade salt water can be used for this. This greatly opens the ability to expand the test to support all the capability that Dr. Birx talks about. And again, by the end of April we will have put a well over 5 million new tubes of either viral transport media or saline into the system. I am going to get to a conclusion here, but this was going to be more of a technical briefing. Next slide."
2020-04-17,01:06:19,Brett Giroir,"So, let’s talk about the fact that the science tells us that we have and will continue to have enough tests to safely go into phase one. So, let me be very granular about this. We’ve already heard that it is beyond the possibility to test everyone in this country every day. It’s just not possible, but it’s also a bad strategy because testing a person now just means they’re negative now. Dr. Fauci could be positive tomorrow because it’s brewing in his system right now and we don’t know it or that he contacts that. That’s not the way we go about things. The way we go about things, as Dr. Redfield said, just think of the weather radar, okay? If the weather radar is clear, you’re not going to have a thunderstorm or tornado. When something pops up, that’s when you’ve got to go to where the action is or know that your warning system is up. So, think of that in the background and I’ll go specifically about that. So, that’s monitoring. Let me talk about how much testing we need just for overall testing."
2020-04-17,01:07:32,Brett Giroir,"I’m just going to give you a number. I’m not saying that this is the number that’s there, but let’s just take a number that we are going to enter phase one when there are 200,000 new cases per month in the United States. Don’t get hung up on that, it’s going to be much less than that, but let’s just say 200,000 cases. So, how many tests do we need? Well, we need to test those 200,000 people to make the diagnosis, right? Everybody, nod your head about that. We have to do that. Now, what’s a safe number over that? You know if everybody I test has the disease, I’m not testing enough, right? But if I test 100 people, to have one person with the disease, that’s probably over testing. So, we assume that a safe number that really gives us a good idea is if about one out of 10 people are positive, then we know we’re oversampling the population enough that we’re getting all the positives. So, if there’s 200,000 cases, I need about 2 million tests, okay? Now, to go to Dr. Redfield’s point, each one of those that are positive have contacts that need to be traced. And on average, the CDC tells me that for every positive there are about five contacts that really need to be traced."
2020-04-17,01:08:42,Brett Giroir,"So, let’s assume that those 200,000 people have five contacts, so now we have an extra million tests. So, 2 million tests out there to detect the 200,000 cases, an extra million out there to trace those contacts, so we’re up to about 3 million cases. If you want to put a fudge factor, say that’s 4 million tests, okay? Those are generally done at the main hospital labs, the commercial labs, state and regional labs. All this can be done as well as some of the labs talked about by Dr. Birx. Next slide. The second group of testing fits exactly perfectly with the influenza-like surveillance system that Dr. Redfield talked about. This is the monitoring. This is the weather radar that it would be out there, that we’re not testing people who are symptomatic. We want to do testing on people who are asymptomatic because you can have asymptomatic carriage, you could have this virus and shed it and not have symptoms or only mild symptoms."
2020-04-17,01:09:47,Brett Giroir,"So, what is the strategy here? This is an unprecedented strategy, okay? This is really unprecedented, but we’re going to do between 300,000 and 500,000 tests per week in the most vulnerable populations that we know that the virus could circulate, and what are they? Number one, nursing home and longterm care facilities. We know that from the history of this virus that that can circulate and be devastating. And it could circulate even in a way that you don’t have symptoms, so we’re going to survey in a very controlled way, driven by the CDC, supervised by the CDC. Surveys over… We may not get to everyone but surveying in the areas to cover in a selective way the 15,000 or so nursing homes. Secondly, we want to work in vulnerable members in cities and the way we think about that is community health centers… I’m a huge fan of community health centers that are led by HERSA."
2020-04-17,01:10:54,Brett Giroir,"There are about 30,000 community health center sites. They take care of 30 million people. Children, adults, elderly. They care for about one third of Americans below the poverty level. They are a raid to take care of our most vulnerable populations. So, we want to survey asymptomatic people in those community health centers. We also want to do in some of our indigenous population and you know very early I was out here bringing machines to the Indian Health Service and in fact 1800 members of the Public Health Service provide care to the Indian Health Service. And their director and chief medical officer are both admirals in the Indian Health Service. Plus workplace monitoring, particularly for workplace environments that may have very close contact or may have a high risk and some of those could be agricultural facilities."
2020-04-17,01:11:48,Brett Giroir,"So, let’s just total that up. We have 200,000 people who need a diagnosis. To make that diagnosis, we want to test 2 million. Okay, so that’s 2 million. We’re going to contact trace with 1 million and let’s just throw you a fudge factor of about 25% on that, so that’s 4 million. And we have this background testing of about 400,000 per month. So, to safely do the testing we need to be in the range of 4.5 million. You followed my numbers, I want you to understand per month that-"
2020-04-17,01:12:24,Unnamed,For phase one.
2020-04-17,01:12:25,Brett Giroir,"Right, for phase one and I want to tell you that’s really how it adds up and that’s where we are. Right now, we’re doing about 1 million to 1.2 million per week. We’re going to continue to push that further and further as we open up the laboratories and we’re able to open all the supplies that we need for that. And I think that’s where I would like to end. Thank you."
2020-04-17,01:12:49,Mike Pence,"Thank you. I’ll ask the team to step back up for questions and we do anticipate, as the schedule permitted, that the president will be returning momentarily. Please."
2020-04-17,01:13:01,Unnamed,"You talked about phase one, will there be enough testing for phase two? Do you have to ramp up capacity for that or how do you deal with that?"
2020-04-17,01:13:11,Mike Pence,That’s a very good question.
2020-04-17,01:13:14,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, that’s a great question and what we will be doing is monitoring how much we have to use in phase one to really help inform phase two, because the really unknown in this to be completely transparent is asymptomatic and asymptomatic spread. And so, if we find that there is a lot of asymptomatic individuals that we find in this active monitoring in what we are very much concerned about, the most vulnerable, then we will have to have increased testing to cover all of those sites"
2020-04-17,01:13:49,Mike Pence,"And as we’ve made clear to the governors and other health officials, we’re going to continue to scale tests. As president’s made clear, we want governors and states to manage the testing operations in their states. We’ve given criteria, we’ve given guidance for how we think that would best operate, but we’re looking for the states, we’re looking for the governors to manage it. But in the midst of that, all of these great experts working with all these great facilities are going to continue to use that great American ingenuity to scale and increase the availability of testing for states to be able to implement as they move closer and closer to that day the president speaks of often. Where we reopen America and put all of America back to work. Mr. President?"
2020-04-17,01:14:38,Donald Trump,"He did well, they all did well I think. I’ll bet they did. Please, go ahead."
2020-04-17,01:14:43,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you. Earlier today, [inaudible 01:14:46] said your tweets encouraging-"
2020-04-17,01:14:50,Donald Trump,Who said this?
2020-04-17,01:14:53,Unnamed,"[inaudible 01:14:53] said your tweets encouraging liberation in Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, were fomenting rebellion. Wondering how that squares with the sober and methodical guidance that you issued yesterday?"
2020-04-17,01:15:06,Donald Trump,"Well, I think we do have a sobering guidance, but I think some things are too tough. And if you look at some of the states you just mentioned, it’s too tough. Not only relative to this, but what they’ve done in Virginia with respect to the second amendment is just a horrible thing. They did a horrible thing, the governor, and he’s a governor under a cloud to start off with. So, when you see what he said about the second amendment, when you see what other states have done. No, I think I feel very comfortable. Go ahead."
2020-04-17,01:15:34,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. president. Just to be clear, when you talk about these states, Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, do you think that they should lift their stay at home orders or can you talk-"
2020-04-17,01:15:43,Donald Trump,"No, but I think elements of what they’ve done are too much. It’s just too much. You know the elements because I’ve already said, but certainly a second amendment and second amendment having to do with the state of Virginia. What they’ve done in Virginia is just incredible. Okay, please."
2020-04-17,01:15:58,Unnamed,"Sir, are you concerned though that people coming out in protest are going to spread COVID to other people? They’re congregating in ways that health experts have said they should not."
2020-04-17,01:16:12,Donald Trump,"These are people expressing their views. I see where they are and I see the way they’re working. They seem to be very responsible people to me, but they’ve been treated a little bit rough. Please, in the back."
2020-04-17,01:16:24,Unnamed,"Thanks, Mr. President. I’m curious about some more of the dynamics we might see as the country begins reopening, as you put it, like a puzzle. So, as you’ve mentioned, we have states where we’re already seeing their curves begin to flatten, but then there are others like Florida or more rural parts of the country where they aren’t projected to peak for weeks or even months. So, can you talk a little bit about some of the difficulties that those later peaking states might face if they need to stay locked down for longer, even as other places around them are starting to open back up?"
2020-04-17,01:16:52,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re seeing great numbers in almost every state. We’re seeing big drops. We’re really seeing in terms of beds, the numbers we have to look at are the beds, the beds being occupied, which is essentially people going in. That means that you have fewer people that are sick, fewer people that feel they have to go to a hospital and those numbers are dropping really precipitously. So, I think that we’re just seeing a lot of good signs. Now, a place like New York, New Jersey, and certain parts of Louisiana. Louisiana has been incredible lately when you look at that drop, that drop has really been great. Michigan’s had a hard time, but it’s starting to do well, so I just think Illinois is another one. You look at some of the numbers but everyone is dropping and they’re dropping rather quickly. We don’t have any hotspot that’s developed, other than we did have a meatpacking plant or two where incredibly you saw the number was rather incredible that took place in that plant. People could ask about that. I wonder who owned that company. It was a weird situation, but generally speaking it’s been very good. The numbers have been really improving greatly. Please, in the back."
2020-04-17,01:18:10,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. US intelligence is saying this week that the coronavirus likely came from a level four lab in Wuhan. There’s also another report that the NIH under the Obama administration in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the US give a grant like that to China?"
2020-04-17,01:18:28,Donald Trump,"The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million, I’ve been hearing about that. And we’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area, we’re looking at it literally about an hour ago and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly, but it was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We’re going to look at it and take a look, but I understand it was a number of years ago, right?"
2020-04-17,01:18:57,Unnamed,"So, you are-"
2020-04-17,01:18:58,Donald Trump,What did you hear the grant was made?
2020-04-17,01:19:00,Unnamed,2015.
2020-04-17,01:19:01,Donald Trump,"2015? Who was president then, I wonder? Okay. Yes, ma’am?"
2020-04-17,01:19:07,Unnamed,"Mr. President, we know negotiations are underway for the next round of funding for small businesses. If tens of billions of dollars went in a matter of days the first time, will this next relief package be enough?"
2020-04-17,01:19:19,Donald Trump,"Well, I think it will certainly… It’s going to get us to a point that’s going to be rather beautiful. We think that that will be the point and it could be they want more, but maybe at a certain point we’re going to stop. It’s been a tremendous success. It’s been executed flawlessly. SBA has done a very good job, but the banks have done a great job. Whether it was Bank of America or Wells Fargo. The community banks have been incredible. I think we had over 4,000 community banks. A lot of people didn’t know you had that many banks, but 4,000 community banks, they gave the money out. It’s so organized and it’s been such a great program and so essentially, we’re waiting for $250 billion. The Democrats are refusing to do it. This is money that essentially is going to the workers. It’s going to keep these companies whole. Restaurants and a lot of great companies, and it’s a small amount of money relative to what it represents because it represents small businesses. It represents them staying in business. And when you look at it, people don’t know, small businesses represent approximately 50% of the power of our business enterprises. Not all the big monster businesses that you read about every day. It’s all of these small businesses when added. It’s something that should be approved by the Democrats, the Republicans want it badly and the people want it very badly."
2020-04-17,01:20:42,Unnamed,If I can just follow up on that.
2020-04-17,01:20:42,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-04-17,01:20:42,Unnamed,"Nearly 10% of the loans that were given out were for $5 million, but some small business owners say they can’t even get a loan for $100,000. Is that acceptable?"
2020-04-17,01:20:50,Donald Trump,"No, they would get that, but they have to approve an… Nobody knew it was going to be the successful. Don’t forget, when you say the money’s gone, it’s been a tremendous success as a program. People, they really want it and some people won’t be able to keep their-"
2020-04-17,01:21:03,Donald Trump,"People, they really want it, and some people won’t be able to keep their business open unless they get that money. It’s been a tremendous success. It’s been executed flawlessly. It’s been… I mean, with few exceptions, it’s really been good, and I think the Democrats are going to do it. Look, Nancy Pelosi, she’s away on vacation or something, and she should come back. She should come back and get this done. I don’t know why she’s not coming back. The fact is, she’s not doing her job and there’s nothing unusual about that for her. Go ahead."
2020-04-17,01:21:29,Unnamed,"[inaudible 01:21:29] said they’re now considering also adding more funding for hospitals, including in this-"
2020-04-17,01:21:32,Donald Trump,"So they are thinking about hospitals, and hospitals… [crosstalk 01:21:36] Well, hospitals are a good thing. Hospitals have been decimated by this. They’ve given up their business, which is good because they did the right thing in order to take care of the COVID-19, and no, hospitals, I’m with that all the way. If they want to add hospitals, we could also add it into phase four if we do a phase four. Phase four would be hopefully infrastructure. A lot of people are talking about the best thing we could do for this country would be the payroll tax cut that I’ve been suggesting. A lot of Democrats like it, believe it or not."
2020-04-17,01:22:09,Donald Trump,"The payroll tax cut. And Art Laffer who’s tremendous… He’s a tremendous… In fact, he recently got the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Economist. He was with Ronald Reagan, and he’s been… He looks like he’s 25 years old, but I think you might be a little bit older than that. He looks so great. But Art Laffer said the single best thing you can do is the payroll tax cut, and I would just about agree with that, and I’d like to see that. I’m not sure that we’re going to get that, but I think that’s something that could be done. It’s simple. It’s really good for both the company that employs these people and for the people that are employed."
2020-04-17,01:22:45,Donald Trump,"So we’re going to see whether that happens or not. The payroll… I put it out there, the payroll tax cut would be a tremendous incentive for this country. Steve?"
2020-04-17,01:22:53,Unnamed,"China now says its coronavirus death toll in Wuhan is 50% higher, up to about 4, 000. Does that sound like a credible number to you?"
2020-04-17,01:23:04,Donald Trump,"Well, you know, when I listen to the press every night saying we have the most… We don’t have the most in the world deaths. The most in the world has to be China. It’s a massive country. It’s gone through a tremendous problem with this, a tremendous problem, and they must have the most. So today I saw they announced that essentially they’re doubling up on the numbers, and that’s only in Wuhan . They’re not talking about outside of Wuhan. So it is what it is Steve. It is what it is. What a sad state of affairs."
2020-04-17,01:23:36,Unnamed,"The investigation into whether the virus escaped from this lab in Wuhan, how active is that, and when do you expect-"
2020-04-17,01:23:42,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re looking at it. A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense. They talk about a certain kind of bat, but that bat wasn’t in that area, if you can believe this. That’s what they’re down to now is bats. But that bat is not in that area. That bat wasn’t sold at that wet zone. It wasn’t sold there. That bat is 40 miles away, so a lot of strange things are happening, but there is a lot of investigation going on, and we’re going to find out. All I can say is wherever it came from… It came from China. In whatever form, 184 countries now are suffering because of it, and it’s too bad, isn’t it? And it could have been solved very easily when it was just starting."
2020-04-17,01:24:26,Donald Trump,"It could have been solved really very easily. Yeah, please, in the back."
2020-04-17,01:24:30,Unnamed,"Thank you sir. So about the 80 million payments that have gone out that you mentioned, you said that less than one percent have had snafus, but that could be 800,000 snafus. So we’ve also seen-"
2020-04-17,01:24:43,Donald Trump,"Well I’m just saying, it’s less than one percent, and the snafus are very minor."
2020-04-17,01:24:48,Unnamed,You’re not talking about the massive numbers of dead people who’ve received-
2020-04-17,01:24:52,Donald Trump,"No, they were 80 million payments, went out over a period of a few days, and they caught certain mistakes that they made, but this is a tiny amount of mistakes. I can tell you, mistakes are made in government where wrong countries were signed. Okay? 80 million… This has been a tremendous success, and any mistake that was made, they’ve been caught, and it’s less than one percent. That’s a very good percentage, I can tell you for government. I mean, how about the Obama website, The Obamacare website, where they spent five billion dollars on building a website that you could have built for peanuts? Okay."
2020-04-17,01:25:29,Unnamed,"If money went out to deceased people, is the government going to get that back?"
2020-04-17,01:25:33,Donald Trump,"Yeah. Anything that was sent out… It’s like sometimes you send a check to somebody wrong. Sometimes people are listed. They die, and they get a check. That can happen. You’re talking about… I guess the number is about 80 million people. Yeah, sure. We’ll get that back. Everything we’re going to get back, but it’s a tiny amount. They’ve done a fantastic job. This was done in a matter of a few days. Yeah."
2020-04-17,01:25:57,Unnamed,Your campaign said today that they are planning on resuming rallies before the election. Is there a timeline that you’re looking at? Would it be restricted to certain states? Have you thought about how that would work?
2020-04-17,01:26:06,Donald Trump,"Well, I hope we can do rallies. It’s great for the country. It’s great spirit. It’s great for a lot of things. To me, it’s a tremendous way of getting the word out. If you look at our success rate, we’ve had tremendous success. We win where we have rallies, including endorsements of candidates. Our success rate is I think unparalleled. There’s nothing like it. So I certainly hope we can have rallies. We’ll find out. I don’t like the rallies where we’re sitting like you’re sitting. I mean, you’ve got many reporters outside trying to get into this room, and I come in, I’m looking at this room, and I see all this. It loses a lot of flavor. It loses to me, a lot of flavor, but I hope we’re going to have rallies. I think they’re going to be bigger than ever."
2020-04-17,01:26:47,Donald Trump,"I will say this. The rallies that we were having until we had to stop with regard to the problem that we had here, the rallies were bigger than they were… I think even substantially bigger. We’d go into the biggest arena, and we’d turn away 20, 30 thousand people sometimes, and in one case, I think they said in New Jersey we had 175,000 people show up for an arena that holds 9,000 people. And they showed up. And the reporters even reported that. That was almost shocking to me. But I hope we can resume rallies, because I think they’re an important part of politics actually."
2020-04-17,01:27:22,Unnamed,"Mr. President, under your reopening plan, some workers can go back to work in phase one, but schools cannot reopen until phase two. Many parents don’t have an option to work from home. So how can you get businesses back up and running as long as schools are closed?"
2020-04-17,01:27:35,Donald Trump,"Well, I think the businesses are going to, and I think now we’ve given the businesses a real jolt, a real positive jolt. They’re able to keep their employees… Without the employees, if the employees leave that area, if they leave, who knows where they’re going? Or if they get another job maybe someplace else, you’re not going to have the same business. So we gave them money to hold their employees. They’re going to do that. We hope we can do $250 billion more. It’s absolutely so inexpensive compared to what it represents, and we hope that’s going to happen, but I think… I really think… Look, you see it with the stock market. T"
2020-04-17,01:28:10,Donald Trump,"he market was up seven or eight hundred points today, and if you would have told me that we would have a virus the likes of which this world has not seen since 1917, which was the Spanish flu, where anywhere from 75 to 100 million people were killed, and that we’d have a stock market that’s not far below its all time high… And it’s starting to get a little low. You know, then you had a thousand point increase and a 1,200 point increase. So now, we have a stock market that’s at a point where it’s not very far away from where it was, and we’ve gone through literally a closed country. Remember this also. I mean, we have had a closed economy."
2020-04-17,01:29:00,Donald Trump,"We had the best economy anywhere in the world by far. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. And remember this, the dollar is very strong, and dollars, strong dollars are overall very good, but it does cause problems. It’s harder to sell outside of the country, et cetera, et cetera. It’s a little harder for manufacturers. Sometimes it’s a lot harder. Everybody wants to invest in our country. Everybody wants… And you know, we’re paying almost zero in interest, in some cases, zero. We’ve never had that before. People want the safety of our country."
2020-04-17,01:29:31,Donald Trump,"But if you would’ve told me that our market was where it is today, and today we had almost I guess more than a 700 point increase, and we’re at a point which is… It’s not what it was, but it’s not that far off. I would have told you that’s got to be an impossibility. The reason that is, is because there is a great pent up demand. This country’s going to come back and it’s going to come back strong. We have to get rid of the virus. We’ve got to open up our country. We’re going to open it up in quadrants. We’re going to open it up as states. Some of the states should get together, and they should work on their own borders and everything because you don’t want to have people pouring through a border of a state that isn’t infected, and you have people coming perhaps outside."
2020-04-17,01:30:11,Donald Trump,"That’s one of the reasons I was asking Tony two days ago about masks. Well, why in Wyoming or Montana would they have to wear masks, their numbers are very good? The reason, if somebody comes from outside, which is very severe, but it’s again… And it’s going to be up to them. It’s a recommendation, but we’ll see. But if you would’ve told me how well we’re doing after we went through the worst event of its kind since 1917, it’s pretty amazing. Question please."
2020-04-17,01:30:44,Unnamed,"Mr. President, about childcare though, millions of Americans aren’t sure how they can go back to work if the schools are closed. How can they have their kids taken care of-"
2020-04-17,01:30:52,Donald Trump,"The schools will be open too, very soon."
2020-04-17,01:30:55,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:30:55] considering something in addition to helping employees stay employed, to help them take care of their kids?"
2020-04-17,01:30:59,Donald Trump,"Yeah. It’s a good question. I think the schools are going to be open soon. I think a lot of governors are already talking about schools being opened, and we do have to take care of our seniors, because we’ve learned a lot about this disease. We’ve learned… Call it a disease. We’ve learned a lot about this plague, and we have to take care of our seniors. We’re going to take care of a lot of people, but I think the schools are going to be open sooner rather than later. And I understand, and I’ve spoken… Some governors are already talking about thinking about getting the schools open. I have a young boy who goes to school. I’d like to see him go to school."
2020-04-17,01:31:29,Donald Trump,"As good as home is, it’s very nice, but we’d like to see him go to school. Please."
2020-04-17,01:31:34,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President. I’d agree with that point. I would like to know about some of these areas that you’d like to open up, some of these quadrants. You singled out Virginia, Michigan. They don’t have a decline in cases yet, yet you tweeted out today that you’d like to liberate them."
2020-04-17,01:31:48,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re going to have soon, but they’re very very very… What they’ve done is very powerful in terms of… You could get the same result out of doing a little bit less. What they’ve done to some people is very unfair. In Virginia, I’m going above and beyond what we’re talking about with this horrible plague. They want to take their guns away. Okay? They want to take their guns away. That’s the second amendment. That’s Virginia. You have a governor who really… I guess he should be under siege. He seems not to be. If he were a Republican, he’d be under siege, but he seems to have escaped something that was pretty bad, including what he said about birth, including what he said about many different things."
2020-04-17,01:32:32,Donald Trump,"But he wants to take… If you take a look at what’s going on in Virginia, they want to take away second amendment rights, and that’s what they want to do. So when you talk about liberate or if you talk about a liberation, you could certainly look at Virginia as one. Go ahead. Anybody else?"
2020-04-17,01:32:48,Unnamed,Mr. President.
2020-04-17,01:32:49,Unnamed,"Which states are ready to reopen your mind, and how soon?"
2020-04-17,01:32:52,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t want to go. I want to leave it to the governors to make that decision. We’re watching very closely. If we see something happening bad that we think is wrong, we’re going to come down very strong on that, very very strong. The federal government has a lot to say. We have a lot to say beyond what anyone understands, and we think, and I’ve gotten to know many of the governors, many Democrats too. It’s Republicans, and I knew the Republicans. I knew some of the Democrats, but I got to know a lot of them. I think it’s going to be in the hands of a lot of good people."
2020-04-17,01:33:25,Donald Trump,"I think a lot of good people are looking at this, and they want to do what’s right Steve."
2020-04-17,01:33:29,Unnamed,"And the vice president is traveling soon, I think tomorrow to Colorado. When are you going to be in a position to travel again?"
2020-04-17,01:33:35,Donald Trump,"Well, they’d rather not have me travel. I think I’ve been in the White House, I don’t know, for months. I don’t know what it is, but it’s for months. Other than I did leave to say goodbye to our beautiful ship. Right? The Comfort, as it left Virginia, when it got out of dry dock. It got out of maintenance very early. It was supposed to be there for four weeks. It was there for a few days. Literally, we got it up to New York. I mean, they didn’t need it like… Well, I wouldn’t say we hoped. I’m glad they didn’t need it. They didn’t need it. That was a good thing. They didn’t need the convention center, 2,500 beds, or depending on your definition, 2,900."
2020-04-17,01:34:13,Donald Trump,"We ultimately converted it to COVID. The Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA, the job they did was incredible, but that’s a sign that they’re making progress in New York. If you look at that, we built it, it was ready. It’s there now. It’s ready. We converted it to COVID. It wasn’t supposed to be for that, at the request of frankly our side. Then ultimately, we converted it, but there is much less demand. That’s such a good thing. I mean, I’m not complaining about that. I think it’s a great… That means New York’s making progress."
2020-04-17,01:34:47,Unnamed,Is it important to you that vice president is going tomorrow?
2020-04-17,01:34:47,Donald Trump,"He’s going to Colorado? I think he’s going to the Air Force to make the commencement, correct?"
2020-04-17,01:34:53,Unnamed,Yes sir.
2020-04-17,01:34:54,Donald Trump,"Oh, I think it’s great. I think it’s great. If he’s going to make the commencement… I hear they’re going to have a very spread out crowd."
2020-04-17,01:35:00,Unnamed,Yes sir.
2020-04-17,01:35:01,Donald Trump,"They are going to be a… I will say, they are going to be socially very good. They’re going to be very far apart. That’ll be very interesting. I think I’m going to watch that one. No, they’re going to be… They’re going to have a good spread, a good distance apart. I spoke to Mike about it. No, I think making the commencement speech, I’m doing it at West Point, which I look forward to. I did it last year at Air Force, I did it at Annapolis, I did it at the Coast Guard Academy, and I’m doing it at West Point, and I assume they’ve got it, and I understand they’ll have distancing. They’ll have some big distances."
2020-04-17,01:35:39,Donald Trump,"So it’ll be very different than it ever looked. Do I like the look? No, I don’t. And eventually, next year they’ll have a commencement which will be like it’s been, like when people like this, our great admiral has done such a great job… When he graduated from where he graduated… Me too. We’re nice and tight. And that’s going to happen again. I don’t want people to think that this is going to be like this forever, but for a period of time, we’re going to have to keep it that way. That includes baseball games and football games and other things, but eventually as this virus goes away, it’s going to be better and better."
2020-04-17,01:36:16,Donald Trump,"Director, it’s going to be better and better, and we’re going to get our lives back to the way they were. You know, one thing that bothers me, a couple of restaurateurs called, and they said, “Sir, I barely made a living with 150 seats. Now if I do what they want me to do, I’ll be down to 25 seats, and I can’t.” I said, “Yeah, but you’re not going to be there forever.” And he didn’t really know that. He thought that they were going to take 150 seats, move it down to 25 to 50 seats, depending on the way he laid it out. I said, “Don’t worry about it. Eventually, you’re going to be back to the scene that you used to have, which was…”"
2020-04-17,01:36:51,Donald Trump,"Look, I could tell you about… And I’m not going to do it because I didn’t want to bring it up, but I could tell you about events that took place, and I said things like, “You’ll never do that again,” or, “You’ll never do this again.” I don’t even want to mention the events. I don’t want to mention what you’re supposed to be doing because… And you know, one of them was so horrible. I said a certain industry will be out of business, never happen again. Two weeks later it was like nothing ever happened."
2020-04-17,01:37:18,Donald Trump,"Hopefully, we get rid of this. We have tremendous talent up here and all over, including governors, including local governments, state governments. I look forward to the time, to me, when we can really normalize. But normalizing is being back to where we were. Yeah, please. Go ahead."
2020-04-17,01:37:36,Unnamed,"Mr. President, some of your allies are calling for China to be stripped as host of the 2022 Olympics. Wondering what you make of that. Is that something that you would consider? Or-"
2020-04-17,01:37:49,Donald Trump,"So I just made a deal with China, where they’re going to put in $250 billion of product. They’re going to be buying 250… 50 from 40 to 50 billion in pharm. I want to see what’s happening with China. I want to see how they’re doing on it. Are they fulfilling the deal, the transaction? We have a lot of discussions going on with China. Let me just put it this way. I’m not happy. Okay? I’m not happy, and I spoke to them, and this could have been shut down a long time ago. They knew it, and we couldn’t get in, and in all fairness, World Health couldn’t get in, and that’s why I wish they took a different stance."
2020-04-17,01:38:31,Donald Trump,"They took a very pathetic stance and a very weak stance, but they say they couldn’t get in. But ultimately, they got in. They got in much sooner than anybody, but they didn’t report what was happening. They didn’t report what was happening inside of China. No, I’m not happy with China. Yeah, please."
2020-04-17,01:38:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I wanted to ask, Dr. Fauci, could you address these suggestions or concerns that this virus was somehow manmade, possibly came out of a laboratory in China? You studied this virus. What are your prospects of that?"
2020-04-17,01:39:05,Donald Trump,Want to go?
2020-04-17,01:39:07,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah. There was a study recently that we can make available to you, where a group of highly qualified evolutionary virologists looked at the sequences there and the sequences in bats as they evolve, and the mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now is totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human. So I mean, the paper will be available. I don’t have the authors right now, but we can make that available to you."
2020-04-17,01:39:41,Unnamed,"Followup sir, on the protest that we’ve seen of people wanting the economies open, does that concern you though, as a health expert when you see folks congregate? And are you worried if that’s encouraged?"
2020-04-17,01:39:58,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well I mean, I’m looking at it from a public health standpoint. I certainly could understand the frustration of people, but my main role in the task force is to make recommendations to protect the health and the safety of the American people. And I would hope that people understand that that’s the reason why we’re doing what we’re doing, and hopefully we’ll put an end to this. Thank you."
2020-04-17,01:40:19,Donald Trump,"And I will say this, I’m very very satisfied with the decision we made. Listening to experts, listening to my gut, the feeling of the vice president and really many others when we put it all together are very… Look, if we didn’t do what we did at the time, we could have lost more than two million people. I really believe that. I could show you charts of other places that gave it a shot, and they’re not doing well. And I would show it to you right now. I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but they gave that a shot. That’s an automatic. I mean, everybody would say let’s do that until they sit down and start thinking."
2020-04-17,01:40:39,Donald Trump,"And we could’ve lost more than two million people. We could have lost more than two million. It could have been much more than that, by the way. We have one that says from 1.6 to 2.2, but it could have really been more than that. But I looked at one in particular, one country in particular that is using the herd mentality and not working out very well. Now, with all of that being said, we have to get back to work. We’ll be crossing lines very soon in many cases. In some cases, we’re well on the way down. In other cases, we’re right at the top and heading down. We’re heading in the right direction."
2020-04-17,01:41:37,Donald Trump,"I saw some numbers from New Jersey, which was having a very tough time. It started… He’s doing a terrific job, the governor, Phil. Phil Murphy. Starting to get some really good signs. I looked at some of the New York numbers. They’re starting to get… They’ve been devastated obviously, but some really good things are starting to happen. So if we would’ve done something different… First of all, it would not have been sustainable. You would have had people… They would have been furious at you and me and everybody up here."
2020-04-17,01:42:10,Donald Trump,"It would not have been sustainable, because you look at some of the hospitals as an example, a certain hospital right near where I grew up in Queens, and you had body bags all over the floor of that hospital. You know the one I’m talking about. All over the floor of the hospital. Now, multiply that times 12 or 15, because that’s the kind of numbers you’re talking about. 12 or 15. And it would not have been… It would not have been… There would’ve been an insurrection. Nobody would’ve understood that, whereas right now, nobody can be blamed, and there is no blame."
2020-04-17,01:42:48,Donald Trump,"We’re all in a situation that was caused, that should’ve been solved long ago. It could have been solved probably very easily. Look, this is a tough enemy, but probably very easily if a certain country did what they should have done. And we’re just starting to learn those facts. But what we did was the right thing. What we did was the right thing. With that being said, we want to get back, and we want to… We’re going to be opening up states."
2020-04-17,01:43:15,Donald Trump,"They’re being opened by very capable people. It’s also point of sale as they say in a different business. It’s the point… They’ll be able to look at where the testing is taking place. We’re going to help them with the testing. We’ve developed some tremendous tests over the last little while, and we’re going to work with the states, and we’re going to help them. But they know every inch of land in their states."
2020-04-17,01:43:36,Donald Trump,"I watched the governor of Arkansas, Asa. You saw that. I thought he was terrific. I watched to the governor of Oklahoma over the weekend being interviewed. He was terrific. They’ve done it a little bit differently, and they’ve done it tight, and they’ve done it strong, and they were very prepared, and they had more beds than they needed, and that’s a good thing. But I’ve seen some very very good things, and I think you’re going to have some very positive events taking place over a very short period of time."
2020-04-17,01:44:02,Donald Trump,"And I think with that, we’ll see you tomorrow. But really this has been… This has been a situation where a lot of great people have been involved, and a lot of great decisions have been made. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you."
2020-04-18,02:13,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon. We continue to see a number of positive signs that the virus has passed its peak. It’s been very devastating all over the world. 184 countries, probably more. This number was as of a week ago. Dr. Birx will walk through some of these trends in a few moments, but they’re very positive trends for winning. We’re going to win, we’re going to close it out. While we mourn the tragic loss of life, and you can’t mourn it any stronger than we’re mourning it, the United States has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country, with a possible exception of Germany. And I think we’re as good or better. On a per capita basis, remember that on a per capita basis, our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of Western Europe, with the lone exception of possibly Germany. This includes the UK, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, France. Spain, for example, has a mortality rate that is nearly four times that of the United States, but you don’t hear that. You hear we have more death, but we’re a much bigger country than any of those countries by far. So when the fake news gets out there and they start talking about the United States as number one, but we’re not number one, China’s number one, just so you understand. China is number one by a lot. It’s not even close. They’re way ahead of us in terms of death. It’s not even close. You know it, I know it, they know it, but you don’t want to report it. Why? You’ll have to explain that. Someday I’ll explain it. Since we released the guidelines to open up America again, and this was two days ago, a number of states led by both Democrat and Republican governors have announced concrete steps to begin a safe gradual and phased opening. Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to open on Monday while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions."
2020-04-18,04:37,Donald Trump,"And I can tell you the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, he knows what he’s doing. He’s a great governor. He knows exactly what he’s doing. Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday. Ohio, North Dakota, and Idaho have advised nonessential businesses to prepare for a phased opening starting May 1st. Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken unprecedented actions to rush economic relief to our citizens. As an example, you don’t hear any more about ventilators. What happened to the ventilators? And now they’re giving you the other. It’s called testing, testing, but they don’t want to use all of the capacity that we’ve created. We have tremendous capacity. Dr. Burkes will be explaining that. They know that, the governors know that. The Democrat governors know that. They’re the ones that are complaining. Through the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve already processed nearly $350 billion to 1.6 million small businesses across the nation to keep American workers on the payroll."
2020-04-18,05:51,Donald Trump,"So we’re asking the Democrats to get it done. This should be bipartisan. This should be a 100% vote, and it’s really been incredible. The $350 billion that’s been approved is so popular and it’s keeping businesses open. It’ll be open, hopefully forever. Our swift action is directly supporting 30 million American jobs. Amy Wright from North Carolina as an example, said the program is a game changer for her and her family. It’s coffee shops and she has 120 employees, many of whom have developmental and intellectual disabilities, and now they’re all staying, and they’re getting paid, and she’s got a dream, and it’s going to take place very quickly when she opens again. So Amy, good luck. North Carolina, a great place. Scott and Julie Alderink help lead a church and own a restaurant in South Dakota with about 15 employees. They were already starting layoffs, layoffs were moving along rapidly, but now they’ve hired their employees back and they can keep their restaurant open and it’ll be moving quickly, very quickly as opposed to not having anybody and probably not having a place to have all of these people employed."
2020-04-18,07:31,Donald Trump,"She would have been out of business, she would have been gone. The Paycheck Protection Program funding is now fully drained. It’s out. It’s gone. $350 billion to small businesses, and in turn it goes to the employees of those small businesses. Lawmakers must stop blocking these funds and replenish the program without delay. The Democrats have to come on board. I used to read that these were Democrat programs, not Republican. It seems to have switched around a lot, hasn’t it, huh? Switched around a lot. The Republicans want it, I think the Democrats probably do too, but they also want other things that are unacceptable. This is about COVID, this is about the plague and what it’s done to us. This isn’t about extraneous things that they’ve been trying to get for years that our country doesn’t want them to have. As we enter the next stage of our battle, we are continuing our relentless effort to destroy the virus."
2020-04-18,08:35,Donald Trump,"My administration is taking steps to protect high risk communities by providing funding for 13,000 community health center sites and mobile medical stations in order to equip them with the most advanced and robust testing capabilities. These sites are incredible. What they can do is incredible. The job they do is incredible. These centers provide care to 28 million people living in medically underserved urban and rural regions, including many African American and Hispanic communities. We’re taking care of them and it’s so important because you’ve all been reading about the disproportionate numbers on African American. And you’re reading a little bit less about Hispanic, but likewise Hispanic communities, the numbers are disproportionate. In fact, we’re doing big studies on it right now. We don’t like it, it’s not right. Nationwide, we’ve now conducted over four million tests, and Debra will be talking about that. It’s double the number of conducted by any other country on earth."
2020-04-18,09:52,Donald Trump,"So that’s more than two times actually the number conducted by any other country on earth. You hear so much about testing. What we’ve done is incredible in testing. And I started with an obsolete broken system from a previous administration or administrations, but I would really say administration for a different reason because testing has become so advanced over the last number of years and we have the most advanced of all. I spoke with other nations this morning, the leaders and they all are talking about our great testing capability and some of them want to know what to do, how can they get involved because they need it for their own countries. In Louisiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and other hotspots, we have also tested more people per capita by far than Italy, Spain, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, and all other major countries. So think of that. In New York for instance, per capita testing is 6% higher than in Singapore. In fact, there’s a typo. It’s 67% high. That’s a big difference. I’d say there’s a big difference between 6% and 60. I was looking and said, “6% doesn’t look too good.” It’s 67%, good job out there, higher than Singapore, 64% higher than South Korea, and 47% higher than Australia. So it’s 67% higher than Singapore, which is a very advanced place in terms of what they’re doing. My administration has also been speaking frequently with many of the governors to help them find and unlock the vast unused testing capacity that exists in their states. Dr. Burks discussed yesterday the commercial and academic laboratories in the states have tremendous unused capability which they can use. The governor should use it. Tremendous unused capability. They’re waiting for business from these governors that some of them complain. I must tell you, for the most part we’re getting along great with them, but some of them like to complain, but I still go back because the hardest thing of all by far by a factor of 20 is the ventilators. And now we’re the king of ventilators."
2020-04-18,12:16,Donald Trump,"We have ventilators, we’re going to be helping other countries very soon. We are going to be helping Mexico. I spoke with the president of Mexico, he’s great, a great guy, and I told him we’re going to be helping him. They desperately in Mexico need ventilators and I told him we’re going to be helping him very substantially. We’re in a position to do that. We’re building now thousands a week and they’re coming in rapidly, and they’re very, very high quality. But we’re also helping governors to develop strategies to smartly deploy their testing capacity to protect vulnerable and underserved populations while getting Americans at lower risk safely back to work. So again, we have tremendous testing capacity. Now, a lot of people like the Abbott test that we came up with. Abbott, it’s a brand new technology, brand new test. It’s great. It’s five minutes, boom, you put it in. And we’re making thousands of machines."
2020-04-18,13:14,Donald Trump,"Abbott is making thousands and thousands of machines, but not everybody’s going to get that one, but they’re going to get others. We have numerous platforms, which we’ll talk about in a minute. Unfortunately, some partisan voices are attempting to politicize the issue of testing, which they shouldn’t be doing because I inherited broken junk, just as they did with ventilators where we had virtually none and the hospitals were empty. For the most part, the hospitals didn’t have ventilators. We had to take care of the whole country and we did a job the likes of which nobody… We assembled an army of young, brilliant people. For the most part young, a couple of older ones, but for the most part they were young, brilliant geniuses that did a job like nobody would believe. I wish you could have seen it, around the clock."
2020-04-18,14:09,Donald Trump,"And now the rest of the world’s coming to us asking if we could help them with ventilators because they’re very complicated, very expensive, they’re very hard to build. And we have them coming in by the thousands. But you don’t hear that from even the governors. Nobody’s complaining about ventilators. And if there was a surge, we could have ventilators to them within hours because we have in stockpile almost 10,000 ventilators. You don’t hear about hospital beds. When I first started, everybody was talking, “Oh, hospital beds, hospital beds.” The governor of New York correctly asked me for hospital beds and we got the Army Corps of engineers out and they built them. He needed him. I know he said that we were projected. We’re not projecting New York, we’re listening to the governors. He wanted them, he needed them, and we gave him thousands of beds in Javits Center. We brought the ship."
2020-04-18,15:02,Donald Trump,"Then the ship, we had it converted to a COVID-19, and that was a big deal by the way because of ventilation and all the things we had to do, but we did. And fortunately for him and for us, all of us, they haven’t used either one very much because the numbers have gone down significantly, but it was there, and it was built, and it was beautiful. 2,900 beds. It was incredible what they did. They did it in a matter of a few days, but unfortunately… And it was very good. The relationship was very good and I’m frankly glad they don’t need them, but they were there. Louisiana, the same thing. I think the governor, Democrat, good guy, and he will I think tell you a story that we had more than enough."
2020-04-18,15:52,Donald Trump,"And I said, “Well, we’re supposed to build one more.” I told him, I said, “If we don’t have to build this hospital, it was an additional anywhere from 500 to a thousand beds. If you don’t need it, would it be possible that we don’t build it? We’d like to build it someplace else or not build it at all and save money, which is okay for government too, use it someplace else.” And he called me back the next day and he said, “Sir, we don’t need it.” I said, “That’s great that you say that. I appreciate it.” And he didn’t need it, but we were ready to go. We took good care of Louisiana. We took good care of Michigan. We took good care of every place. We didn’t miss a trick and we’re in great shape on testing. We have different platforms."
2020-04-18,16:31,Donald Trump,"We actually have nine different platforms and on Monday we’re going to be adding one. That’ll be nine to 10/ I don’t like to count on them before they’re up, but we’ll have anywhere from nine to 10 platforms with a tremendous testing capability and people can go, especially with phase one. Now at the same time, just like with ventilators, we’re building now the best ventilators. Just like with ventilators, our testing is getting better and better. I took the first test. The first test was not pleasant. This was not a pleasant thing. I said, “You got to be kidding” to the doctor. “You got to be kidding.” Up your nose and then we hang a right and it goes down here, and then we’ll wiggle it around here under your eye, and then we’ll pull it out and we’ll see. I said, “No, there’s no way that can happen. Is that the way it goes? You sure?”"
2020-04-18,17:27,Donald Trump,"This was a very unpleasant test. And then I was tested a few weeks later with the new tests that just came out, the Abbott, where they just touch your nose basically, and they put it in a machine and literally a few minutes later, they tell you if you’re fine. And I was lucky in both cases because I’ve seen the damage that this does to people. But we have great tests. They’ve really gotten better, and better, and better as we go along, but we have a tremendous lab capability, laboratory capability all over the country. And for some reason, the governors, a lot of them are-"
2020-04-18,18:03,Donald Trump,"For some reason the governors, they’re not, a lot of them are, but some of the governors like to complain and they’re not using it. We have tremendous capability. We’re ready for them. And as we go along, just like with the ventilators, we’ll get better, more advanced, and we’ll be able to do things that nobody would have even believed possible. But we started off with a broken system. We inherited a broken, terrible system. And I always say it, our cupboards were bare. We had very little in our stockpile. Now we’re loaded up. And we also loaded up these hospitals. And we’re talking about payment. We gave billions of dollars worth of things to hospitals, and we’ll have to work that out at some point. In fact, I guess they’re going to be working that out with Congress. But we loaded up hospitals, the federal government loaded up hospitals with things to take care of people that are very desperately, or were not … We weren’t worried about payment at that time. We said, “You’ll take care of it at the right time.”"
2020-04-18,19:03,Donald Trump,"But we gave billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of medical goods, and medicines, and equipment to hospitals and we’ll work it out with them. But people don’t like to talk about that. So we have done a job that nobody believed. This was a military and private enterprises march. We marched. And unfortunately, with the other side, because they’re viewing it as an election. “How did President Trump do?” “Oh, he did terribly. Let’s see. He did, yeah, he did terribly.” Oh, but we just got them the ventilators that they didn’t have that they should have had. We just got them hospital beds by the thousands. We just got them testing that they don’t even know how to use."
2020-04-18,19:57,Donald Trump,"In some cases, they have machines that they’re only using 5% and 10% of the machine because they have an advanced machine and they don’t know how to use it. It can do much more. So we’ve had people explain how to use it. So, I don’t know. I don’t think I do that on the other side. I don’t, I really don’t. I think that here we have a crisis that we have to work together and I hope we’re going to work together. But we’re moving along and we’re moving along well. We’re moving along well. This should not be a partisan witch hunt, like the Russia witch hunt that turned out to be a total phony deal."
2020-04-18,20:38,Donald Trump,"Unfortunately, some of these voices, though, are attempting to to bring this into politics and whether it’s testing, or ventilators, or hospital beds, or other dimensions of our sweeping public health response, we have had a sweeping response. And speaking to the leaders of other countries this morning, they said, “This is incredible the way you’ve done this so quickly.” We’re only talking about a few weeks since everybody knew this was such a big problem. And the rest of the world is watching and they respect what we’ve done, because I don’t think anybody else, I know nobody else could have done what we have done. And we started with garbage. As our experts said yesterday, America’s testing capability and capacity is fully sufficient to begin opening up the country totally."
2020-04-18,21:34,Donald Trump,"Indeed, our system is by far the most robust and advanced anywhere in the world by far. The rest of the world will tell you that. I spoke this morning to a friend of mine, President Moon of South Korea. He just won the election. He won it by a lot. He had a big victory, which I was happy about. And he was saying what a great job we’ve done in this country. I told him the same thing. He said what a great job we’ve done here in this country. So I appreciated that. By the way, he had a great victory and we’re very happy about that from the standpoint of our country working very well with them, South Korea."
2020-04-18,22:13,Donald Trump,"As we approach and the approach that we use, but as we approach, hopefully the downward side of what’s going on, I think you’re going to see some incredible hard facts and evidence that what we did was right. There’s a lot of talk about heard, the word heard. I don’t want to show you charts of people that went a different way, but it’s scary. It’s scary. We would have had, I think, millions of people die, had we done a different way. And I think numbers are just coming out where they’re estimating 60,000 people will die. That’s horrible. I always say one person is too much, especially in this case, when it could have been stopped in China. Could have been stopped in China before it started. And it wasn’t. And the whole world is suffering because of it."
2020-04-18,23:05,Donald Trump,"But this heard concept and everybody had to think of it at the beginning because, look, look at us. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. Better than China, better than any country in the world, better than any country’s ever had. We had the highest stock market in history by far, and I’m honored by the fact that it has started to go up very substantially. That’s because the market is smart. The market is actually brilliant. I’ve seen it. And they’re viewing it like we’ve done a good job. They view it that way because if you would’ve told me that we’re at 24,000 or beyond, and the highest we were ever was, we never hit 30. We were getting close to 30, so let’s say around 29,000. We were at 24. We were heading down, I started to say, “Oh wow, we may be heading into territory where I started.” I didn’t like that. Now we’re way up."
2020-04-18,24:02,Donald Trump,"But if you would’ve said to me, with what we’ve gone through, not caused by our country or our people, or any … Not caused by certainly anybody within our country. But if you would’ve said that after going through this horrible plague that we’d have a stock market that’s much, much higher than when I started, much higher than where I started. And I think we have tremendous momentum when we have a big election coming up. But I think we have tremendous momentum. First we get rid of the plague and because of what we’re doing with the PPP, what we’re doing with the paycheck, as we call it, I think we have a chance to have these companies get back to action quickly."
2020-04-18,24:52,Donald Trump,"But our approach to testing is based on facts, data, and very hard evidence, not partisan agendas or coordinated political talking points. Mike Pence, who’s a phenomenal guy, he’s making the commencement address right now at the Air Force Academy where they’re being very politically correct. Everyone’s sending not six feet but 10 feet apart. Okay? And it’s very different. I made that speech last year. I’m going to West Point. I think they’re changing the date to June 13th because of what’s going on in New York. They’re moving it to June 13th, West Point. So I’m doing that commencement speech. And they’re going to have … it’s sad because … but it’s a big start. They’re going to have the cadets, they may not have the parents, but they’re going to have the cadets. The parents are so proud of them."
2020-04-18,25:40,Donald Trump,"I know at the Air Force Academy where Mike is speaking right now, they don’t have the parents, they have the cadets, they have a very, very wide spread. And you talk about social distancing, they are really spread. I looked at it, they’re using 10 feet. So he’s doing that. But they’re having it. It’s very important to have it. And that’s a great thing. That’s a great thing. That’s a big start. So he’s there right now and I will tell you he’s a gentleman, Mike Pence, a real gentleman."
2020-04-18,26:14,Donald Trump,"And they requested, the Democrat senators requested, a phone call with him yesterday. And I think they had, for the most part, all of them on, approximately 47. I heard it was just about all of them, whatever it might be. I don’t be wanting to be wrong by one, or two, or 10 and have the press say, “He lied.” That, “He told a lie. Terrible, terrible.” Whatever it was. But they have 47 and I guess most of them were on. I heard they were so rude. I used the term today. I said rude and nasty. But I heard they was so rude, no matter what he said, which was all very positive in terms of winning this battle against the invisible enemy. No matter what he said, they were fresh, they were nasty, and it was, I heard, just a terrible thing."
2020-04-18,27:09,Donald Trump,"And I said, “Mike, that’s politics. That’s what it is. If we came into this room today and said, ‘The battle is over, we have won.’ It’s 100% gone. The Democrats would say, ‘The President has done a horrible job. He has done a disgraceful job. It is a shame how bad he is.’ This is the talking points. This is political.” And it would be nice not to have that. Especially when we’ve done the job we’ve done. All you have to do is look at the big V for victory or V for ventilator. Take a look at it. Everybody said they had us on that. They had us."
2020-04-18,27:49,Donald Trump,"They thought they had us, but we got them done at numbers that nobody would have believed. And we did use our act, our Production Act. And we used it. But we didn’t use it. We didn’t need it like a hammer. All we had to do, for the most part, we used it actually in a number of cases, but the most part, all we had to do is talk about it. All we had to do is say, “We’re going to use it if you don’t do this.” And everybody was, for the most part, good. We used it a couple of times because it didn’t work out the easy way, but it worked out the hard way."
2020-04-18,28:18,Donald Trump,"But whether it was masks or ventilators, it was incredible what we’ve been able to do. So this is a very critical time for the American people and the American people deserve real information and responsible and thoughtful dialogue from their elected leaders and from the media. The media has been, some very honest, but some very dishonest, you know that. You know that. I even read a story where Mark Meadows, this is a tough guy. He was crying, he was crying. There was Maggie Haberman, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of Russia. But she was wrong in Russia. So was everyone else. They should all give back their Pulitzer Prizes."
2020-04-18,28:57,Donald Trump,"In fact, it turned out that the crime was committed by the other side. The crime was not committed by this side. It was committed by the other side, a bunch of bad people. You saw the reports coming out over the last two weeks, they got caught. So Maggie Haberman gets a Pulitzer Prize. She’s a third-rate reporter, New York Times. And we put her name up here last week. You saw that. People thought it was a commercial. It wasn’t a commercial. It was like a commercial, but it wasn’t a commercial. It was just clips. And because we exposed her as being a bad reporter, what happened is she came out and said, “Mark Meadows was crying.” And they made it sound, I said, “Mark.” And it’s okay if he did, I wouldn’t look. But I think he was crying probably, really, for the wrong reason, they had it down. But he’s not a crier. And if he was, I know criers. I could tell you people that you know that are very famous, they cry. And that’s okay, too."
2020-04-18,29:57,Donald Trump,"But it was a nasty story in so many ways. It was fake news and she only did it because we exposed her for being a terrible, dishonest reporter. She is. I’ve known her for a long while. I haven’t spoken to her a long time. I made the mistake. I take a picture with her at the desk a long time ago. Every time she does the story if I say … I haven’t spoken to her in long, many, many, many months, maybe years. I don’t speak to her. She’s fake. A lot of people are fake. A lot of people. We got a lot of fake people. But what happens is she writes this story as retribution, puts it in the New York Times. And the New York Times is a very dishonest newspaper. It’s my opinion. It’s not an opinion. It’s actually, from my standpoint, the very hard thing to figure though, most people wouldn’t know that. But I know it because I know the facts."
2020-04-18,30:47,Donald Trump,"And they make up, I said it today, they make up words. “Sources say … ” The most often used. “Sources say … ” You know what sources say, man? Sources say means they have nobody and they make it up. Okay? And they have a few other type statements that mean the same thing. But, “Sources say … ” is the most often used [inaudible 00:31:09] in the Washington Post, New York Times especially, CNN. Fake news, CNN. They should really be mandated, and I mean mandated to use a name. If there’s a source, use the name. Say that Kayleigh, Kayleigh McEnany said. Or somebody. And you’d find out that, number one, the source wouldn’t say it. The sources don’t exist. I don’t believe the sources exist. And I try and tell this. The beautiful thing about doing these conferences is that we have tremendous numbers of viewers and I’m able to reach the viewers without having to go through fake news where they make a good story into a bad story."
2020-04-18,31:51,Donald Trump,"So with all of that, it’s been an incredible period of time. We’ve done a fantastic job. We’re the talk of other nations. The leaders of other nations are calling us for help. They’re calling us for equipment. They’re calling us for testing capacities. Now with the testing, we are going further. Deborah is going to talk about that now. With the testing, we have some other tests coming up that are going to be, I think, phenomenal. I think they’re going to blow away everything as soon as they come out. And we’re going to get them out as soon as possible. But I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and say a few words about where we’ve come, how far we’ve come, and more importantly where we’re going from this point. Because honestly it’s quite amazing. Thank you very much."
2020-04-18,32:42,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you Mr. President. If we could have the first slide, I wanted to give you an update on where we are as states, and as counties, and as cities. I know you all are watching carefully. The numbers have shifted over the last few days. What happens when nations, when states change the reporting from confirmed to probable, so now all probable cases are included. They had to add them back in even though the cases may have been from March, they were added over 14, 15, and 16th of April. And states may continue to be adding them."
2020-04-18,33:20,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Eventually, we’re hoping that those get accounted for on the day when the presumptive cases or the probable cases were counted. But right now they’re added in in one fell swoop. So this is New York and New Jersey. And I think we all know how difficult, and what a difficult time both new New York and New Jersey have had. I call your attention to the axis. It goes up the 250,000 cases, so you can get a frame of how we’re talking about some of the other metro areas. Next slide."
2020-04-18,33:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"These are the 25 metro areas, the top 25 metro areas, and you can only see the New York metro area in this slide. Again, the axis goes up to about 300,000, includes the New Jersey part of the metro area as well as part of southern Connecticut. Next slide."
2020-04-18,34:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But if I take New York out, and the reason I wanted to do that, now the axis is one 10th of the previous axis, so that previous slide, 300,000. This slide 30,000. So that will give you a frame of reference for some of these other metros. The reason I wanted to show you this is this is cumulative cases. And we are still tracking very closely the issues in Chicago and Boston. But on this slide I hope you can see the yellow line. That is Detroit. And Detroit and this mayor of Detroit has really done an extraordinary job. And the people of Detroit have done an extraordinary job with their social distancing."
2020-04-18,34:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The other line I want to call your attention to is the line here. This is New Orleans. And I think, frankly, I was concerned about New Orleans because they had a lot of preexisting comorbidities. They have two or three major hospitals, but cover a very large area, a geographic area. And that other blue line that you can see that’s down right here. That’s the Seattle line. And you can see that, their response, because of the nursing home alert, they were one of the first states and the first metro areas to really move to social distancing. And so they’ve really never had a peak like many of the other metros. Next slide."
2020-04-18,35:43,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Then I just want to take you through some of these new case graphics. That was cumulative cases. This is daily cases. And obviously there’s a lot of variability and variability in reporting, but you get a sense over time when you look at daily cases. So New Orleans is on the panel on your left, and Baton Rouge on your right. But you-"
2020-04-18,36:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"… Panel on your left, and Baton Rouge on your right. But you can see clearly in New Orleans about a month ago, very low levels, probably less than 50 cases, large peak and spike around the beginning of April, and they have come down. And they have it down to very few cases. Again, I showed you before how both their syndromic cases have come down, as well as their actual number of cases. Next slide. This is Seattle. So you can see they had a much lower peak, and this is when we talk about flattening the curve. This is what flattening the curve looks like. It becomes a longer, slower decline, but it never gets very high, and then goes back down. Next slide. And then this is Detroit, and we always look at the metros as a consolidated. So this is both Wayne and Oakland in Michigan, and we really want to thank the mayor for the incredible job that they have done to really ensure that everyone is receiving the adequate health care and testing. And they’ve done quite a good job with testing in Michigan."
2020-04-18,37:08,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But all of these states, Louisiana and New York have tested 30,000 per million inhabitants. Those are some of our highest numbers across the board. Next slide. The president talked about on the case fatality rates, and we have lost a lot of Americans to this disease, and we pray and hope for each one of them that are in the hospitals, and the excellent care. What does this graph illustrate, is the amazing work of the American people to really adhere to social distancing. This was nothing we had ever attempted to do as a nation, and the world hadn’t attempted to do. But they were able to decrease the number of cases so that in general, most of the metro areas never had an issue of complete crisis care of all of their hospitals in a region. So you can see our case fatality rate is about half to a third of many of the other countries."
2020-04-18,38:09,Donald Trump,Excuse me. Does anybody really believe this number? Does anybody really believe this number?
2020-04-18,38:16,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I put China on there so you could see how basically unrealistic this could be. When highly developed health care delivery systems of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and Italy, and Spain, with extraordinary doctors and nurses and equipment have case fatality rates in the twenties, up to 45, and Belgium is extraordinarily competent health care delivery system, and then China at 0.33, you realize that these numbers, even, and this includes the doubled number out of Wuhan. So I want really to put it in perspective, but I wanted you also to see how great the care has been for every American that has been hospitalized. And the extraordinary work of our doctors and nurses, and our laboratorians on the front line who have been doing an excellent job. Next slide. Then we also wanted to show-"
2020-04-18,39:09,Donald Trump,"Also, the number for Iran. Does anybody really believe that number? You see what’s going on. Put that slide back, if you would. Does anybody believe this number? Does anybody believe this number? You saw more bags on television than that."
2020-04-18,39:27,Dr. Deborah Birx,"This is why the reporting is so important. And I think you remember almost six weeks ago, maybe a month ago, I was telling you what Italy was showing to us, and what France was telling to us. And the warnings that they gave to us, and said, be very careful. There’s an extraordinary high mortality among people with preexisting conditions, and we used their information to bring that to the American people. That came, that alert, that alert before we even had significant cases, came from our European colleagues on the front line. And that’s why we keep coming back to how important in a pandemic, and a new disease. It’s really critical to have that level of transparency, because it changes how we work as a nation. It allowed us over March 15th to make an alert out there about vulnerable individuals, and really the need to protect them, and my call out to millennials to really protect their parents, protect their grandparents, and get that information out to everyone that there were preexisting conditions that put people at greater risk. That information came from our European colleagues, who were in the midst of their battle themselves."
2020-04-18,40:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And so there is never an excuse to not share information. When you are the first country to have an outbreak, you really have a moral obligation to the world, to not only talk about it, but provide that information that’s critical to the rest of the world to really respond to this credibly. And I really want to thank our European colleagues who worked so hard to get us that information, even in the midst of their own tragedies. And I think that really shows how important transparency is. And we go to the next slide. We’re going to show you this really encouraging and great news. So we know that fatalities will continue to lag, because people are in hospitals still, and some are still in intensive care units, but these COVID-like illnesses. This is our hospitalizations that are related to flu per 100,000 Americans. This is this year’s flu season. And you can see our COVID-like illnesses, and this is all of them, probable, and confirmed cases. Our hospitalizations are declining."
2020-04-18,41:38,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Now I showed you metros that have made tremendous progress. And we’ve been up here many times talking about it being six, 10, 15 additional cities, and now we’re really just focused on Chicago, and Boston, and Massachusetts, and really some issues, Providence is starting to improve now. Their relationship to the two large outbreak cities. But this is really reassuring to us of the progress we’re making across the country against this disease, and I just really want to conclude by thanking again the American people for making these types of graphics possible. Thank the data team who puts these together for me, so they are working until about 3:30 every morning to make sure that we have the most up-to-date information. That’s the data that goes to our supply chain individuals, to ensure that every hospital, in every state, and every community has what they need based on data, and to make sure that we’re serving the needs of the American people as effectively as possible. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-18,42:45,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much Deborah, fantastic job. Take this. Thank you very much. The fact is, that we’ve been learning a lot from Deborah, and Tony, and so many of the professionals, the director, PEPFAR, we’re spending the United States for that help, to the best of my knowledge, mostly in Africa, $6 billion a year. And that’s on AIDS. What we’ve done for AIDS in Africa is unbelievable. We spend $6 billion a year. That’s been going on for long time. Nobody knows that. You’ve never heard that. I’ve never heard that. $6 billion a year. Millions of people are living right now, and living very comfortably because of the fact that we have found the answer to that horrible, horrible plague. That was a plague. But we spend $6 billion a year. And from what I hear, it’s very well spent, done by professionals, including this great professional right here. That was the thing that you worked hardest on, and something that was very close to her heart."
2020-04-18,44:02,Donald Trump,"So it’s something that I think people should start hearing. The World Health Organization, we’re just finding more and more problems, and we spend this money really well. There are other ways we can spend the $500 million, that’s 500 million. This is six billion, but we can find other ways to spend it where people are going to be helped in a much greater way. We’re doing some research on certain people that take a lot of credit for what they do, and NIH is giving away a lot of money. A lot of money. We give away, for years, for many years, they give away a lot of money. And some people complain, and some people don’t. Some people are extremely happy, so we’re looking into that also. They’re giving away approximately, as I understand it recently, more than $32 billion a year, 32 billion. And so we’ve been looking at that for a while, and we’re going to be having some statements to be made about that. $32 billion a year. It’s a lot of money, and we want to make sure it’s being spent wisely."
2020-04-18,45:14,Donald Trump,"And we’ve been doing that, by the way. And we’ll have some statements on that. And those are much bigger numbers than what we’re talking about with national, if you look, with our friends from wherever they come from. 500 million is a lot of money, but it’s not a lot compared to the kind of money that we give out. I think over the years it’s been averaging about $32 billion, 32 billion. So we’ve had our eye on that one for a while. We also talked about the lab in China where I guess 3.7 million was given some time ago. And we’re looking at that very closely. Chief of staff has that pretty much under control, but it’s money that too bad it got spent there. But that was spent, what year was that, Mark? It was four or five years ago."
2020-04-18,46:12,Mark,Six years ago.
2020-04-18,46:13,Donald Trump,"Six years ago approximately. So we’re looking at that. And that’s the lab that people are talking about. All right. So we’re looking at a lot of things, this tremendous waste in our government. We found it in many different ways, and in many different forms. And this is one of them. This is one of them. We can spend, I was talking to Dr. Burks. We can spend $500 million using all of it in a much more efficient manner if we choose to do that, and it’ll be to the good of many more people than are getting it right now. But you look at the mistakes that were made. I mean so late, long after I said we have to close off our country, they were actually against our closing off our country to China. When I did that in January, they were against that. They didn’t like the idea of closing off our country. They said there was a bad thing to do actually. And they’ve since taken that back."
2020-04-18,47:08,Donald Trump,"But it was a very lucky thing that we did it, very lucky. We would have had numbers that were very significantly greater. Tony Fauci said that, he said it would have been very significantly greater had we not done that. So we made a lot of moves that were good moves. But it’s still a very depressing subject, because it’s a lot of death. And if it was stopped very early on at the source, before it started blowing into these proportions, we have 184 countries that would have been in a lot better shape. But our country is getting back, and I expect that we’re going to be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. I will take a few questions. Jeff."
2020-04-18,47:50,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, you’ve mentioned, and the doctor’s mentioned China a few times today, clearly suggesting that the data has not been good."
2020-04-18,47:58,Donald Trump,"Well you tell me, do you think that data is good when you see that? Do you think that’s correct, okay? Do you honestly believe that’s correct?"
2020-04-18,48:06,Jeff (Reporter),It’s a pretty dramatic contrast. So my question-
2020-04-18,48:07,Donald Trump,"Dramatic. Yeah, I’d say it’s dramatic."
2020-04-18,48:09,Jeff (Reporter),"So my question to you, sir, is-"
2020-04-18,48:11,Donald Trump,"Why didn’t the press, why didn’t you people figure that out though? Why do we have to put up a chart? It’s an impossible number to hit, but why haven’t you come up and said that?"
2020-04-18,48:22,Jeff (Reporter),"The question, sir is, is China now cooperating with United States to figure out what happened, and what do you want from them now?"
2020-04-18,48:30,Donald Trump,"Well, they said they’re doing an investigation, that they’re doing an investigation. So let’s see what happens with their investigation. But we’re doing investigations also. Yeah, go ahead please."
2020-04-18,48:41,Unnamed,"You’ve spoken, we heard Dr Burks a moment ago say that every country has a responsibility to tell the rest of the world what’s going on. You’ve talked repeatedly about how this could have been stopped in the past. I know you don’t want to telegraph what you would do, but do you think that there should be some consequences if in the end, China was responsible for all of this?"
2020-04-18,49:03,Donald Trump,"Well if they were knowingly responsible, certainly. If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible? Yeah. Then there should be consequences. You’re talking about potentially lives like nobody’s seen, since 1917. And the other thing, had we not done what we did in terms of closing, because there is that concept of let’s let it ride, but at some point, I’m going to have to, I don’t want to embarrass the countries that I like, and leaders that I like. But you have to see some of these numbers. In my opinion, so we’re talking about maybe 60,000 or so. That’s a lot of people. But 100,000 was the minimum we thought that we could get to, and we will be lower than that number. Anywhere from a hundred to 220,000 people. But I really believe it could have been millions of people had we not done what we did. We made a lot of good decisions. But one of those things, go ahead."
2020-04-18,50:04,Unnamed,Have you ruled out that this was an unknowing situation?
2020-04-18,50:10,Donald Trump,I haven’t ruled out anything. I want to look at the facts as they come in. I want to look at the facts. Please.
2020-04-18,50:15,Doug Christian,"Thank you sir. Thank you very much, Mr. President."
2020-04-18,50:17,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-04-18,50:18,Doug Christian,"Last week you claimed that you were charged of everything. Yet the American people don’t understand why you’re unwilling to use the awesome powers of your presidency to make American companies manufacturer the PPE, and also the testing equipment that you need to implement-"
2020-04-18,50:32,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-04-18,50:33,Doug Christian,Implement your recommendations-
2020-04-18,50:35,Donald Trump,"I know, but who are you with?"
2020-04-18,50:37,Doug Christian,I’m with TMN. Recommendations for-
2020-04-18,50:39,Donald Trump,TMN. What is TMN?
2020-04-18,50:41,Doug Christian,Talk Media News.
2020-04-18,50:42,Donald Trump,What?
2020-04-18,50:43,Doug Christian,My name is Doug Christian with Talk Media News.
2020-04-18,50:46,Donald Trump,Talk Media News.
2020-04-18,50:47,Doug Christian,Yeah.
2020-04-18,50:47,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, keep reading your question."
2020-04-18,50:50,Doug Christian,"The thing is, how to make companies build these testing equipment so that you can do what you want, what you’ve recommended."
2020-04-18,51:01,Donald Trump,"We’re doing that right now. We’re doing it. We’re doing that right now with ventilators. We have General Motors, we have General Electric, we have 11 different companies, great companies building them for us, all over the United States. We’re starting to make our own gowns, as they call it. We’re making some incredible things. And as far as the testing is concerned, most of that now is done in the United States. We’re doing it in the United States, our different platforms. So I just don’t think you were listening."
2020-04-18,51:27,Doug Christian,But senators were complaining-
2020-04-18,51:29,Donald Trump,which Senators?
2020-04-18,51:30,Doug Christian,To Vice president Pence yesterday-
2020-04-18,51:31,Donald Trump,Which Senators?
2020-04-18,51:33,Doug Christian,Independent Senator Angus King.
2020-04-18,51:35,Donald Trump,"He’s not an independent, okay. Angus King is worse than any Democrat. Go ahead."
2020-04-18,51:39,Doug Christian,"But he said that he was livid, actually."
2020-04-18,51:42,Donald Trump,"Of course he said that. Because he’s a Democrat, okay. Angus King is not an independent. He uses that term for whatever reason. It’s a waste of time."
2020-04-18,51:52,Doug Christian,But he’s not a very emotive type of senator.
2020-04-18,51:52,Donald Trump,"Oh, yes he is. You haven’t seen him. Okay? You haven’t seen him? No. Angus King is a Democrat, and that was totally staged. I heard that, and it was totally staged. Just like you read the question, he read his question. Yeah. Please, in the back."
2020-04-18,52:06,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about one of your retweets."
2020-04-18,52:12,Donald Trump,Which one?
2020-04-18,52:13,Unnamed,"The one you retweeted from Paul Sperry. Let’s see if authorities enforce the social distancing orders for mosques during Ramadan, like they did churches during Easter. I’m wondering-"
2020-04-18,52:25,Donald Trump,"No, I would like to see that. And I just spoke with leaders, and people that love mosques. They love mosques, and I’m all in favor of that. But I would say that there could be a difference, and we’ll have to see what will happen, because I’ve seen a great disparity in this country. I’ve seen a great disparity. I mean I’ve seen a very strong anti-Israel bent in Congress, with Democrats. It was unthinkable seven or eight or 10 years ago, and now they’re into a whole different thing, between Omar, and AOC. I say AOC plus three, add them on. You have, I mean the things that they say about Israel are so bad. And I can’t believe it. Just a minute. So I would be interested to see that, because they go after Christian churches, but they don’t tend to go after mosques. And I don’t want them to go after mosques, but I do want to see what their bent is. Yes, please, in the back."
2020-04-18,53:23,Unnamed,"Do you know, Mr. President-"
2020-04-18,53:24,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-04-18,53:25,Unnamed,That in fact you’re suggesting that imams wouldn’t follow social distancing?
2020-04-18,53:28,Donald Trump,"I just had a call with imams, I just had a call with ministers, rabbis. We had a tremendous call with the faith leaders. No, I don’t think that at all. I am somebody that believes in faith. And it matters not what your faith is, but our politicians seem to treat different faiths very differently, and they seem to think, and I don’t know what happened with our country, but the Christian faith is treated much differently than it was, and I think it’s treated very unfairly. Yes, please go ahead in the back."
2020-04-18,54:01,Unnamed,I just want to ask-
2020-04-18,54:02,Donald Trump,Let’s go.
2020-04-18,54:02,Unnamed,If the Department of Justice will in fact…
2020-04-18,54:02,Donald Trump,Please go ahead in the back. Let’s go. OAN please.
2020-04-18,54:06,Unnamed,"Mr. President, the paycheck protection program saved an estimated 15 million jobs. It’s run out of money. The Democrats, specifically Nancy Pelosi, have been blocking that funding. Do you know why speaker Pelosi is dragging her feet on that?"
2020-04-18,54:20,Donald Trump,"Well, she thinks it’s politics. I don’t think it’s good politics. Nancy Pelosi has been blocking it. Schumer has been blocking it. And I think they think it’s good politics. I don’t think it’s good politics. I think it’s bad politics, but I don’t care about the politics. It’s so great for our country because we’re going to have all of these companies that are going to be… it’s a bigger employer… let’s say it’s the same, but essentially it’s the same power, all of these small businesses added together, as the big companies. It’s about 50/50. And it’s so important. And they will be scattered if we weren’t able to do what we’re doing."
2020-04-18,54:55,Donald Trump,"And essentially we’re giving these small businesses that won’t make it. They can’t because they’re closed. We’re giving them money to take care of their employees, so when we open, they can get back into business. It’s been a very popular plan even with Democrats. I think it basically passed unanimously twice. The first section, which is 350 billion. So we’re trying to get 250. Nancy Pelosi’s blocking it. She sits in her house in San Francisco, overlooking the ocean and she doesn’t want to come back. She doesn’t want to come back. She doesn’t want to come back to DC. She’s got to get back and get this thing approved. It’s very important."
2020-04-18,55:32,Donald Trump,Please go ahead.
2020-04-18,55:34,Unnamed,"Dr. Birx, if I may. You again praised the American people for doing their bit over the past few weeks. So what goes through your mind when you see photographs of crowded beaches in Florida? Is that a concern for when we start seeing some of these restrictions being lifted?"
2020-04-18,55:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, as I described, we go Metro by Metro, County by County and so I’d have to link that with a specific County and look at their case rates. I believe the governor and the public health system that Florida has, they have some of the best County public health individuals I have ever had to deal with. They are amazing, as I had to work with them under HIV AIDS. So if the County health directors believe that that’s appropriate for their County, then I’m not going to second judge an individual’s approach to this. Because I can’t see into every single County and load the low rates. I can just see there’s no cases. So I don’t know if that’s a County with very small cases or not, but I think their County health official would know."
2020-04-18,56:36,Donald Trump,"Many of the counties as you know, are really free of this horrible enemy. So we’re opening up. You’ll be seeing a lot of this country start to open up fairly quickly. Yes, please."
2020-04-18,56:50,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve mentioned the importance of social distancing, but for example, Stephen Morrison, when you appointed to your open the country task force, is organizing a protest in Wisconsin, but aren’t they in a sense protesting your very own guidelines?"
2020-04-18,57:07,Donald Trump,"Well, we have a flexibility. I didn’t see what Stephen said. I can tell you is a very good economist. He’s been calling shots right."
2020-04-18,57:13,Unnamed,"He said, sorry. He said, “We need to be the Rosa Parks of government injustices.”"
2020-04-18,57:19,Donald Trump,"Well, there is a lot of injustice. When you look at a Virginia where they want to take your guns away, they want to violate your second amendment. When you look at… look, I’m getting along very nicely with the governor of Michigan, but she has things, don’t buy paint, don’t buy roses. She’s got all these crazy things. I really believe somebody sitting in their boat in a lake should be okay. They shouldn’t arrest people. Some of them are being unreasonable. I really believe that they’re being unreasonable."
2020-04-18,57:52,Donald Trump,"But I think Virginia is a great case though, because they’re using this… they’re trying to take your guns away in Virginia. And if people in Virginia aren’t careful, that’s what’s going to happen to them. So yeah, I mean I could see where he’s coming from. I think it’s a strong statement, strong statement, because hopefully this will be over very soon for all of us. But some have gotten carried away. They have absolutely gotten carried away."
2020-04-18,58:16,Unnamed,Do you feel some of these protesters are protesting your social distancing guidelines?
2020-04-18,58:21,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. I notice there are a lot of protests out there and I think that some of the governors have gotten carried away. We have a lot of people that don’t have to be told to do what they’re doing. They’ve been really doing everything we’ve asked them. We have a few States where, frankly, I spoke to the governors and I could have gotten him to do, if I wanted to do what would have been perhaps politically correct, but they’ve been doing incredibly anyway. And as one of them said, “Everybody’s doing exactly the same. In fact, our record is better than States where they’re under a mandate or where they’ve agreed to do certain things.”"
2020-04-18,58:58,Donald Trump,"Now we have some great States out there. We have incredible people in our country, and for the most part, it’s a strong statement, but I understand where he’s coming from. And I think one of the really important places that people really have to start looking at is what’s going on in Virginia, because that’s a mess with really a governor that’s under siege anyway. Yeah, please."
2020-04-18,59:19,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir."
2020-04-18,59:19,Donald Trump,"No, with a beautiful head of white hair. Go ahead. I’ll tell you if I like his hair in about a minute, after he asks the question."
2020-04-18,59:26,Unnamed,"[Inaudible 00:59:26] with the Wall Street Journal. On that point though, does the tweeting about, in the case of Virginia and linking the second amendment to some of these issues about lifting some of these restrictions in these States, not potentially pose a concern for the governors and civil unrest and potentially [inaudible 00:59:44]? I have a second question, too."
2020-04-18,59:46,Donald Trump,"Well I think just for that question, I think that’s an easy one. That’s not even politics. We’re entitled to a second amendment and he’s trying to take the second amendment… meaning that state is trying to take… the Democrats in that state. The Republicans are fighting it. They’re trying to take that second amendment right away. To me that’s Liberty. When I say liberate Virginia, I would say liberate Virginia when that kind of thing happens and where does it all stop? So I think it’s a very good analogy."
2020-04-18,01:00:14,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-18,01:00:16,Unnamed,Is this the right time to bring in a second amendment issue?
2020-04-18,01:00:18,Donald Trump,"I think when they talk about taking your guns away and if you notice, at the beginning of this pandemic, there were more guns sold, I think, than it almost any time in history. So it’s obviously a big issue. And then you have them working and signing documents trying to take your second amendment away essentially. So I do think it’s an appropriate time to bring it up."
2020-04-18,01:00:42,Donald Trump,Go ahead. Go ahead. Second.
2020-04-18,01:00:43,Unnamed,"This past week we’ve had an extraordinary slew of events from adversaries, North Korea, Russia, China and Iran all pushing back on US policy, or toying with US military forces. What’s your messages in these countries who may be trying to take advantage?"
2020-04-18,01:00:58,Donald Trump,"I don’t see it. No, I don’t see it. We had a very good relationship with Russia. We worked on the oil deal together. I was with, by telephone, King of Saudi Arabia and the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. We worked out a deal on oil. That was a very important deal to them and to us and to Saudi Arabia. It was in a deadlock. You know it. You covered it very well. Actually, the Wall Street Journal covered that very well. I worked with Putin and with the King on that and President Putin was a total gentleman and it was very important to get that done and the King was great."
2020-04-18,01:01:35,Donald Trump,"And we actually had to bring in Mexico because Mexico was a lone hold out and they showed great flexibility. You know the story. No, I think we’re doing fine. Yeah sure, North Korea, I see they’re testing short range missiles, been doing it a long time. I received a nice note from him recently. It was a nice note. I think we’re doing fine. Look, if I wasn’t elected, you would right now be at war with North Korea. Okay. I’ll tell you for your people that don’t understand the world and they don’t understand how life works. If I wasn’t elected, you would right now, maybe the war would be over, hopefully with a victory. But if you remember when I first came in, we didn’t have ammunition. Not a good way to fight a war. President Obama left us no ammunition. Okay. And he left us virtually no medical and ventilators. He left us, the cupboard was dry, right? The cupboard was dry. No, I think right now you’d be at war, essentially in some form, be over, it would be raging with North Korea, if I weren’t president. And we’re doing just fine with North Korea, just fine. Let’s see how it all ends up. In the meantime they said, “Oh, Trump’s given up.” And then you say, “Oh, really? What’s he given up?” And they said, “I don’t know.” Then they said, “He met.” “Oh, I met. I met.” No, I have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. That’s not a bad thing to have a good relationship. Obama wanted a relationship. He wouldn’t meet with Obama, wouldn’t meet with him. Okay. I have a good relationship with him. We met at the line. I stepped over the line the first time, anything like that’s ever… it’s all good. It’s good."
2020-04-18,01:03:11,Donald Trump,"But when they say, the stupid people, I call them stupid people or the haters, they say, “Trump’s given up so much.” Really? I’ve actually increased the sanctions. China’s been very good on the border. In fact, right now the border is stone cold closed between China and North Korea. Our relationship with China was good until they did this. Once we found out about this, once we found out, look, we just made a trade deal where China is going to have to buy $250 billion a year in our product, 50 billion from the farmers, 40 to 50 billion from the farmers. The relationship was good when we were signing that, but then all of a sudden you hear about this. So it’s a big difference."
2020-04-18,01:03:50,Donald Trump,"The question was asked, would you be angry at China? Well, the answer might very well be a very resoundingly yes, but it depends. Was it a mistake that got out of control or was it done deliberately? Okay. There’s a big difference between those two. In either event, they should have let us go in. We asked to go in very early and they didn’t want us in. I think they were embarrassed. I think they knew it was something bad and I think they were embarrassed."
2020-04-18,01:04:18,Donald Trump,"No, I think we’re doing very well. So you said Russia, you said China, you said North Korea-"
2020-04-18,01:04:24,Unnamed,And Iran.
2020-04-18,01:04:25,Donald Trump,"Iran. When I came in Iran was a terror. We had 82 points of fighting. We had 18 points of major confliction. The first week I said, “Tell me about Iran.” “Sir, we have 18 points of confliction.” Meaning Yemen, Syria, Iraq, they’re going into Iraq all over the place. They’re a much different nation right now. I stopped that horrible deal. And they want to talk except that Kerry violated the Logan Act. He made the deal and he doesn’t want them to make a deal because… I would have made a deal, in my opinion, except that John Kerry, who made the deal originally, which was a stupid deal to make. Gave them $150 billion, gave them 1.8 billion in cash, in green. That would be more than this room, 10 times, with $100 bills. You could fill up this room 10 times with $100 bills and it’s not that small of room."
2020-04-18,01:05:24,Donald Trump,"And I say he violated the Logan act. I think it was a major violation. I think we would have had a deal if it wasn’t for John Kerry, but he doesn’t want to be number one, embarrassed and number two, he says, “Let’s wait till after the election.” Maybe sleepy Joe Biden’s going to win. And if sleepy Joe Biden wins, you’ll own the United States and China will own the United States. China’s paid us, you know from the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of billions of dollars. Is that right? Tariffs. And we gave a lot of that money, small percentage, but a lot of money to the farmers. And it kept the farmers going great. We’re getting tens of billions of dollars in tariffs. And by the way, for those of you that say, “Oh, we’re paying.” China devalued their currency in order to pay these. We didn’t pay. China paid. They don’t like to write that. They also added money into their system. So they paid for that."
2020-04-18,01:06:13,Donald Trump,"No, I think you have numerous countries waiting to see whether or not sleepy Joe wins. Because if sleepy Joe won, they own our country. They will take our country. Go back two months, we had by far, China was supposed to catch us. You know better than anybody, Wall Street Journal. For years I’ve heard by 2019 China will catch us. There’s only one problem, trump got elected in 2016. That was a big difference. And we were going leaps and bounds above China and before the problem with the plague, China was having the worst year they’ve had in 67 years. That was before the plague. Now they’re getting really hurt and so is everybody getting hurt. I don’t want them to get hurt, but they’re all getting hurt. Everybody’s getting hurt. It’s a horrible thing that’s happened. But we had the greatest economy in the world by far. China isn’t even close, go back two months, and we’re going to keep it that way."
2020-04-18,01:07:14,Donald Trump,"But when you mention Iran, Iran is a much different country than it was. When I first came in, Iran was going to take over the entire Middle East. Right now they just want to survive. They’re having protests every week. They’re loaded up with the plague, which I don’t want. I’ve offered to help them if they want. If they need ventilators, which they do, I would send them ventilators. We have thousands of excess ventilators coming in and here. We have a stockpile of ventilators and we’re starting to send them so that hospitals can fill up their stockpile, which they should have. New York had a chance to get 16,000 ventilators and they chose not to do it and I understand that. It’s a hard decision for a thing that may or may not happen. I fully understand that. I’m not even complaining about that."
2020-04-18,01:07:56,Donald Trump,"I’m only saying this, Iran was a terror when I came into office. Right now they don’t want to mess around with us. They don’t want to mess around with us. Two things. North Korea, same sanctions we’ve always had except more. We haven’t given anything. I think you’ll hopefully take that back to the Wall Street Journal because they really don’t understand it. They really don’t. And with Iran, that’s a different country right now. And they want to make a deal. The only reason that they don’t, they’re being shamed because the guy that gave them the sweetheart didn’t want to…. met with him many times. He should have never met with them and in my opinion, he’s telling them, “Don’t, wait, maybe Trump will lose,” and then you can negotiate with a Patsy with a weak guy and you’ll take over."
2020-04-18,01:08:44,Donald Trump,"Between you and Russia, nobody’s been tougher on Putin. He knows it better than anybody. Nobody been tougher on Putin than me. Look at the sanctions. Look at what I did with their pipeline going into Europe. Nobody even knew about it. I exposed it. Now everybody talks about it. I think it’s a terrible thing for Germany to do, but at the same time, I have a very good relationship with Putin and I was able to make a deal with Russia and Saudi Arabia and OPEC plus, they call it OPEC plus, that’s going to save us, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, other States, energy States, going to save us hundreds of thousands of jobs. And in fact, your paper wrote an incredible editorial for a change, that Trump made a great deal for our country. That was a nice thing. I was shocked to see it coming out of the Wall Street Journal."
2020-04-18,01:09:36,Donald Trump,Thank you all very much. We’ll see you tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you very much.
2020-04-18,01:09:43,Unnamed,How many asymptomatic people have been tested? Is it possible to get that number from you guys?
2020-04-19,00:01,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. I’d like to begin by saying that we’re continuing to negotiate with the Democrats to get our great workers and small businesses all over the country taken care of. I think we’re getting close to a deal. Could happen, could happen. A lot of good work has been going on and we could have an answer tomorrow and we’re going to see what exactly does take place. We’re also looking at helping our hospitals and our rural hospitals who have been hurt very badly. The rural hospitals for a long time have not been treated properly. We’re looking to help them and beyond, so we’re looking at hospitals also as part of the package and we’ll see how that all comes out. But a lot of good things are happening. Some very good negotiations. Just got off the phone with the Secretary of the Treasury and we have some very good negotiations going on right now, and I think you could have a nice answer tomorrow, but we’ll see."
2020-04-19,01:05,Donald Trump,"America continues to make steady progress in our war against the virus. As of today, we’ve tested 4.18 million Americans. That’s a record anywhere in the world. The United States has now conducted more total tests than all of the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada. And our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people. So we’ve done more testing than all of these countries combined. France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria and Australia, Sweden and Canada. That’s something, right? We’re doing a great job. We are, this team is an incredible team and that includes Army Corps of Engineers a lot of our military people, our admirals, our generals, got one of our great admirals here, has done an incredible job. You haven’t slept too much in the last two months either. Look at him. Somebody said to me, “President, you look tired.” I said, “I should be tired.”"
2020-04-19,02:23,Donald Trump,"We should all be tired, but we have to win, right?"
2020-04-19,02:27,Unnamed,Yes sir.
2020-04-19,02:27,Donald Trump,"Tomorrow the president, the vice president, will lead a call with our nation’s governors from FEMA headquarters, Mike?"
2020-04-19,02:35,Mike Pence,Yes sir.
2020-04-19,02:36,Donald Trump,"To review what more they could do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies, working very hard with governors now on testing and want to help them out. Before the call, we’ll send them a full list of all of the large laboratory machines in the states. They have a lot of machinery in the states, that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there and they’re really high quality machines, by the way. And the potential capacity of those machines, if they’re fully utilized, a couple of them didn’t know that they could be utilized in a different manner. They were only up to 10% and they can go 90% more. Many governors are still relying on their state laboratories rather than the full and much larger capacity that is available to them."
2020-04-19,03:19,Donald Trump,"As an example, commercial laboratories such as Quest and LabCorp, these are massive laboratories that can handle a lot more than they’re being sent. A few days ago, it was at 30%. They were only at 30% capacity. Now, I don’t know, they’re probably the same, but they have a lot of capacity. In addition, academic laboratories, big research labs. There’s tremendous capacity out there and some of them want the fast, the instant Abbott machine, which just came about due to the research during this little short period of time and it’s very quick. But these labs can do it very quickly also, and they’re massive. They can handle much more than the machine, the small machine can handle. We continue to procure millions of swabs, test collectors. I have something here, just happen to have, it’s a swab. It looks innocent. Not very complicated. Anybody like to see what it looks like. Should I open it? Does everybody?"
2020-04-19,04:24,Unnamed,"Open it up. Yeah, open it up."
2020-04-19,04:25,Unnamed,"Yes, please."
2020-04-19,04:25,Donald Trump,"Open it up. I will. This is what it’s about, right? Does it remind you of something? it Reminds you of this, right? One’s a swab, one’s a Q-tip. It’s actually different. It’s very sophisticated actually, but it’s a little bit like, so this is the swab, and we’ve ordered a lot of them. They have a lot of them, some of them, some of the states, they were shipped to states and the states don’t know where they are, but that’s it. Why don’t we give this to Karen? Perhaps she’ll take an extra test. Right? But this is a big deal and we’re working on it and we’re working with the companies and I think in the end we’re going to have a tremendous success. Nobody is close to us. No country is close to us."
2020-04-19,05:27,Donald Trump,"In fact, and I appreciate it very much, the Wall Street Journal wrote a fantastic piece, a highly respected gentleman, Christopher DeMuth, and this piece was just in the Wall Street Journal, weekend edition. “Trump rewrites the book on emergencies.” That’s what’s happened, too. And we, just read one paragraph. “He’s given pride of place to federalism and private enterprise, lauding the patriotism and proficiency of our fantastic governors and mayors,” meaning I do call them fantastic when it’s appropriate, “and our incredible business leaders and genius companies,” I guess I probably use those terms too, when they’re doing a good job. When they’re not doing a good job, I don’t use those terms. “Our heroic doctors and nurses and orderlies and our tremendous truckers.” They have all done good jobs. “By shouting out many of them by name and documenting their deeds on a fully daily basis, he has vivified the American way in action. Once it was reluctantly aroused,” it was hard to get it aroused, and it is hard to get it aroused, but we got it aroused. “When asked why he has not issued orders for nationwide home and business lockdowns, he has emphasized that the intensity of the epidemic varies widely and is best met by calibrated state and local judgments.” That’s the judgments of governors and local people. “And added pointedly that such steps would conflict with the Constitution.”"
2020-04-19,07:07,Donald Trump,"But very importantly, he’s just a very respected gentleman. To see this was a very nice feeling. Not for me necessarily, but for all of the people that have worked with us. I mean, they’ve worked so hard and we’ve developed tests that are so fantastic. We’ve come up with things that nobody had ever heard of and we did it during this pandemic. We did it under pressure. It’s called reaction under pressure. It’s pretty amazing what our people have done and that includes all of our military people and our CDC, just about everybody you can imagine, including Tony and Deborah, and they’ve worked long hours."
2020-04-19,07:51,Donald Trump,"There’s nobody that’s getting a lot of sleep. We’re close to finalizing, I want to thank the writer Christopher, for this article, and it’s a great article. That was frankly, at least of it what I read, it was a great article. We appreciate it. We’re close to finalizing a second partnership through which a U.S. manufacturer would convert its existing plant to produce over 10 million additional swabs for a month and we should be ready to announce this in a very short period of time. We also are going to be using, and we’re preparing to use the Defense Production Act to increase swab production in one U.S. facility by over 20 million additional swabs per month. We’ve had a little difficulty with one, so we’re going to call in, as we have in the past, as you know, we’re calling in the Defense Production Act and we’ll be getting swabs very easily. Swabs are easy. Ventilators are hard. Ventilators are a big deal and we are now the king of ventilators. We have so many ventilators. I said nobody that needed a ventilator has been turned down. It’s pretty amazing. Nobody."
2020-04-19,09:06,Donald Trump,"We’re working with the world-class team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to use its injection molding capacity to potentially produce over 10 million collection tubes per week. That’s tremendous numbers. In the meantime, the supply chain and logistics task force continues to surge testing and needed supplies all throughout America. Mike’s team and the task force, they just met. They’ve been meeting virtually every day and it’s a great team, right? It’s a great team. They’ve been doing a great job, mike. You’ve been doing a great job. Many governors are doing this incredible work and they’re working with us very closely on testing and working in their states. And again, it should be a local thing because it’s point, it’s all these points within a state, but we’re helping them a lot and we want to help them a lot. We’re going to help them more than a lot, actually, if you think about it, with what we’ve done."
2020-04-19,10:04,Donald Trump,"Think of it. We’ve done more than all those countries combined. We’re encouraging them to share their successful strategies with other governors. Some of the governors are doing a better job than others. The robust capacity that we’ve brought online will empower governors to deploy sophisticated strategies so they can safely reopen their states. Some people believe in testing very strongly and other people believe in it less strongly, but still it’s a very good thing to have. I think we can say that. Some people believe in it like they can’t exist without testing and other people don’t believe in it nearly as much. They can see how they’re doing and they feel how they’re doing and they’ve been pretty vocal about that. I think you know pretty much who I’m talking about, but I believe if they want it, we should give it to them and get it for them and work with them."
2020-04-19,10:57,Donald Trump,"You must remember that the governors wanted to have total control over the opening of their states, but now they want to have us, the federal government, do the testing. And again, testing is local. You can’t have it both ways. Testing is a local thing and it’s very important. It’s great, but it’s a local thing and we’re going to get it done to a level in a very short period of time because all of these, all of the swabs are coming in. All of the necessarily materials. A lot of them, as I said, are already there, but a lot of people don’t know that yet. But we’ll be doing testing at a level, already we’re doing testing at a level nobody’s ever done before, but we’ll be doing testing at a level that the biggest tester in the world would be very happy, very soon."
2020-04-19,11:49,Donald Trump,"And it is, it’s very much like ventilators. You don’t hear the word mentioned and that’s much tougher, much tougher when you have to build these machines. We built thousands of machines. We’ll more than help the governors and we’ll make sure that everything goes well just like it did with ventilators, just frankly like it did with face masks on a much easier subject as face masks. Again, everything’s easier than a ventilator. Ventilators are tough. But now I spoke yesterday with the president of Mexico and with various other countries. We’re going to be helping them with ventilators. We have tremendous numbers of ventilators. In fact, I hear, I understand that Governor Cuomo is going to be sending up to Massachusetts some of the excess ventilators that we were able to get and that’s great. I think that’s a great thing."
2020-04-19,12:40,Donald Trump,"The number of new hospital admissions is also significantly down. When you look at these numbers, it’s a good thing to see other than the fact that we also know how people have been just ravaged by this curse, by this horrible scourge, plague, call it. It’s got many different names. In many of the hotspots, including a 50% decline over a nine day period in New York city. That’s a fantastic decline. It’s a beautiful thing to see after going through the opposite. We continue to see improvement with declining trajectory of cases in Seattle, Detroit, New Orleans, Indianapolis, and Houston metro areas, more evidence that our aggressive strategy is working. And I think the American people for their selfless devotion, the American people have done a hell of a job. We’re saving countless lives though, and again, I’ll say it, because I always wanted to say, “well, can you leave it open?” Nobody ever heard of anything like this."
2020-04-19,13:45,Donald Trump,"Not since 1917, more than a hundred years ago, has anything like this happened. And in those days they had no real communication. So you couldn’t say, “go inside, don’t,” people just died. Almost a hundred million people, it’s reported. It’s tough, so the American people, what they’ve done is incredible. And they’ve learned a lot. You see people picketing a little bit and they want to get out. They want to get out and get back with their lives and that’s good. But they have learned a lot. They’ve learned about distancing even now, at least until this thing totally goes away. They’ve learned about their washing their hands and all of the different things that we’ve been talking about ad nauseum for so long. And they get it. They get it. In some places the governors are ready to go and other places they can’t go yet and they won’t go. They want to, they have to have it safe."
2020-04-19,14:38,Donald Trump,"I want it to be safe too. It has to be safe. And again, I have to say this, I can’t emphasize it strongly enough. I’m probably going to show you charts of some of the countries that are really having trouble. And one in particular is having a massive problem where they said, “let’s go. We’re just going to keep going.” Well, they’re the lines that we’re famous for now. Some are flat and some are up. This is like a rocket ship, this country is. And they didn’t, they decided let’s go and let’s wing it. That’s, they thought it was okay, but it’s a problem. It’s a big problem. And there’s another couple. There’s one in particular that everybody thinks did it, but the people are staying in. Okay? The head of a country doesn’t have to say stay in. These people are smart people. They know what’s going on. They see what’s going on. So they don’t have to say, they can say they’re not doing that, but the people who are staying inside, there are not a lot of people outside sitting at cafes despite what the mode of a country is."
2020-04-19,15:45,Donald Trump,"But if you look at Europe, most countries have done this. A couple tried not to. Italy tried not to, and they held it and Spain tried not to. They went that way. France tried not to. I mean, nobody wants to do this. It’s a brutal step. We’re going to close down your country, whoever heard of a thing like this? But we would have had millions of people die if we didn’t do this. Millions of people. And I believe that Mike. I think in looking at things that we’ve been looking at over the last couple of days, I think, and really over the last couple of weeks, from the time we did it, shortly thereafter, I said we made the right decision in closing down, made the right decision on borders, banning people coming in from China, banning ultimately people coming in from Europe."
2020-04-19,16:35,Donald Trump,"But we would have had millions of deaths instead of, it looks like we’ll be at about a 60,000 mark, which is 40,000 less than the lowest number thought of. So this isn’t a case where people would say, “oh, we would’ve had that number. It’s similar to a flu.” It’s not the same thing as a flu at all. Because if we wouldn’t have done anything, you would’ve had, so a flu would have 35 and it goes from 27 to 35, 40, 50 sometimes. It’s over a long period of time, much different. It’s even a much different death, to be honest. It’s a much different death. This is violent."
2020-04-19,17:10,Donald Trump,"CMS is finalizing new guidelines for doctors and patients to resume elective surgeries. It’s a big thing. A lot of hospitals were closed. They couldn’t do any elective surgeries. They’ll be able to start doing that. Procedures and medical care that needs to be done in person. As long as the rate of infections remains low in a community, we want patients to be able to go to their doctors, get clinically tested, have work done, surgeries, receive treatment for chronic conditions and resume preventative care. So we’ll be allowing that to happen very soon. We had no capacity in the hospitals with what happened with the plague. We had no capacity to do it. If your doctor believes you need a treatment in person, you can get a treatment now. You can and should get a treatment now. We are asking that healthcare facilities have plans in place to keep patients safe during their visit. Some places like New York, New Jersey, where they really got hit hard, it’s going to be a little bit tougher. They’ve done a great job, but they really were a center. I mean they were a center. I was watching that. It was incredible."
2020-04-19,18:25,Donald Trump,"But now they’re leveling off and I think they’ll be coming down very soon. Administrator Seema Verma will be telling you a little bit more about it. Mike’s going to say a few words. Seema will then speak, tell you a little bit more about that. My administration continues to execute our massive military operation to supply our hospitals with equipment they need and beds if necessary, but it looks like we’re totally covered on beds. We have plenty of beds. It’s highly unlikely. That would be bad news if we needed more beds, but it looks like it’s going just the opposite direction. I want to thank Governor Cuomo, the relationship there for this whole thing, where building hospitals was very good. We built a little bit more than we needed, and that’s good as opposed to building a little bit less. That’s not good, but he’s worked very well with us."
2020-04-19,19:20,Donald Trump,"The governor of Louisiana has been great on the bed, on that whole situation with the beds. Frankly, the governor of Michigan was very good with us on beds. It’s a very complex subject. You need buildings or you have to do tents or you have to do a lot of different things, a lot of different ways, but the Army Corps of Engineers was fantastic. They were fantastic. Florida, likewise. Governor DeSantis, and I could name probably six other locations. I’ll tell you one, California was fantastic. He was really good. He was really good and I appreciate the fact that he said what he wanted to say and he wasn’t letting the press force him into saying something that he didn’t want to say, so I appreciate it very much. Governor of California, he really worked very hard. We work together. We worked very hard."
2020-04-19,20:20,Donald Trump,"The federal government is currently procuring more than 100,000 ventilators through new production or purchases with thousands already delivered. We’ve delivered thousands of brand new ventilators, all throughout the country. New York would be, I guess, the biggest user, and they are now taking some of their excess ventilators, which is great, and they’re sending them up to Massachusetts. I think it’s 400. And that’s a great thing. Our total supply of ventilators continues to exceed, by a lot, total expected demand. Governor Cuomo said today that no one who needed a ventilator was denied a ventilator. That’s a beautiful statement and I appreciate it and all governors are in that same position. We do have a clip that I thought would be appropriate to put up today. It’ll take two minutes and I think you’ll find it interesting, but we appreciate it and let’s see if we can do that. You’ll turn out the lights and we’ll see if we can do that. Thank you."
2020-04-19,Video,Andrew Cuomo (Video), (21:38) We bent the curve.
2020-04-19,21:41,Donald Trump,He’s a good looking guy.
2020-04-19,Video,Andrew Cuomo (Video)," (21:42) Government did it and people did it, but government facilitates people’s actions, right? We had to double the hospital capacity in New York state. That’s what all the experts said. The president brought in the Army Corps of Engineers. They built 2,500 beds at Javits that Michael and Northwell were operating. It was a phenomenal accomplishment. Close to a thousand people have gone through Javits. Luckily, we didn’t need the 2,500 beds, but all the projections said we did need it, and more by the way. So these were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilization and the federal government stepped up and was a great partner, and I’m the first one to say it. We needed help, and they were there. State and local governments were fantastic. The hospital system was fantastic. New Yorkers were fantastic. And that is an undeniable fact. Just look at what they said was going to happen. CDC, coronavirus task force, Cornell, McKinsey, all of them, and now the line up here, and the actual line is down here. What do you owe the variants to? Heroic efforts on behalf of people as facilitated by government, federal and state."
2020-04-19,23:03,Andrew Cuomo,
2020-04-19,23:12,Donald Trump,"We actually had something else. Are they finished with it? They left out the good part. Great, great job, fellas. They did a better job with ventilators. No, Andrew had something else to say that was really nice, but we won’t go through that. I mean, it was really a good statement. You want to put the rest of it up or do you not have it? I just think it’s so good because it’s bipartisan. This is not about Democrats, Republicans, this is about a thing that hit our country, the likes of which has never happened to us before. Wars, those wars, Civil War, sure. The First World War, the Second World War, they’re not fought on this country. This is being fought in this country, but it’s being fought in 184 countries all over the world. It’s terrible. But I want to thank Andrew, Governor Cuomo for the statement. He actually, if you go a little bit further, it was even a far beyond even that. [inaudible 00:24:19] You remember? Huh?"
2020-04-19,24:22,Unnamed,We’re going to work on getting the first part-
2020-04-19,24:24,Donald Trump,"Well that’s okay, whatever. He said some really good things and it makes people feel good. Actually, the Wall Street Journal, Christopher was saying, I want to make people feel good too. When they’re doing a good job, I want to make people feel good. I want the Admiral to feel good, he’s worked so hard. Mike has worked so hard. And it was very nice. It was on this morning, it was Andrew this morning. So it’s a little longer clip than that, but you’ll see, it was really a very nice thing that he said and people really appreciate that because they’ve done a great job. The federal government’s done a great job. I mean, with all of it, and this is easy. The swabs are, that’s easy. We have them coming by the tens of millions. We have them coming at a level that you’ll have so many swabs, you won’t know what to do with them. That’s easy."
2020-04-19,25:20,Donald Trump,"So they’ll all be there, a lot of them are there already. They’re learning about their testing capacity that they didn’t know about that we have in the various labs. Including academic, they have to remember, you have a lot of these big colleges that have labs that are totally ready to help. But I want to thank The Dynamic Ventilator Reserve because what they’ve done is incredible. That’s a capital DVR by the way, an innovative public private partnership, that’s what we created. We’re gaining access to up to 65,000 additional ventilators in hospitals across the nation that can be redeployed very quickly to areas with the greatest need when they’re not in use and we right now have almost 10,000 in our reserve."
2020-04-19,26:11,Donald Trump,"We’ve been able to give away thousands, like we helped Andrew or we helped Phil in New Jersey, he’s doing a great job. Andrew would tell you that too. They have a very good relationship working together and working with us. Now we’re back up to almost 10,000 and this is after giving away tens of thousands of ventilators. And we’re going to fill up the reserves of states, we’re going to work with them so in case this happens again. But we’re also going to help other countries. I was telling you, the president of Mexico, we’re going to be sending a pretty large quantity to Mexico. They very much need them and to other countries where they need them. I’ve had about six calls with leaders of other countries and they need them. They’re hard to get done, we did. Our companies stepped up and they did an incredible job."
2020-04-19,27:03,Donald Trump,"Some of them were automobile companies and they’d take an assembly line and they said, “Guess what? We’re making ventilators now for awhile.” But because of this historic steps that we’ve taken, I remain confident that every American who needs any of this equipment, any of the things we’re talking about, we’ll either have it now, already has it or will shortly have it. Through the Project Air Bridge, we’ve completed 64 flights carrying over 600 million pieces of personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, and other medical gear with 50 more flights scheduled in the very near future. The team doing that is an incredible team of military people and young geniuses. Some are older geniuses, but mostly younger geniuses, I think I can say. Some are people that made vast amounts of money in Silicon Valley, these are very smart people. The job they’ve done is incredible."
2020-04-19,27:58,Donald Trump,"And I said, “Where do you come from? Well, I sold my company, sir. Oh really, how much did you get?” I think he said $700 million. I said, “That’s good. You want to work for the government? No, I want to help our country, sir.” And it’s tremendous brain power, it’s a beautiful thing to see. Young, incredible people that love this country, and they worked with a military. Admiral, you would say they were pretty smart, right?"
2020-04-19,28:22,Unnamed,"Yes, sir."
2020-04-19,28:23,Donald Trump,"They’re in the upper scales of IQ. They were the upper, they were the top scale, I’ll tell you, and they’re great people. But FEMA’s working to commit another $384 million to produce another 64 million gowns for healthcare. These are the highest quality where they’re very safe. When you put them on, they’re safe. Very important, the quality of the gown is very important. It’s people in different places, different countries that wearing gowns with cuts in them and these are very safe. We want to thank America’s textile manufacturers for their partnership in this remarkable undertaking. Two U.S. companies, Hanes and Standard Textile are on track to produce five million gowns by the end of the month and that’s really moving. That’s really moving. Two great companies, you know the companies. Another great American company, Honeywell, recently began manufacturing N95 masks in Rhode Island, where they converted a factory in less than five weeks instead of the nine months it was normally expected to take. So they’ve already done it and they did it so rapidly. Five weeks instead of nine months."
2020-04-19,29:39,Donald Trump,"It’s amazing the spirit of this country, it’s really about the spirit of the country. We said do it, do it fast, but they did it in a… and this was a major conversion too, this is a different world. Honeywell is hiring more than 1,000 American workers to produce 20 million masks per month. 20 million masks a month. Thanks to the Defense Production Act we’ll be receiving another 40 million masks over the next few weeks. And I also want to thank 3M because they really stepped up. We had a little dispute at the beginning but that got worked out quickly and they’ve been doing a great job. 3M, they really have been, I want to thank their great CEO. We had a little skirmish but it worked out well. And they’re doing a lot of work right now on masks and other things. This production is in addition to the 55 million N95 masks my administration has already distributed. Plus we ordered, and it’s coming in soon, 500 million masks."
2020-04-19,30:40,Donald Trump,"You would think, what are you going to do with them? They get used rapidly. In addition to that, as you know, we sterilize masks now, great company in Ohio, recommended by the governor of Ohio strongly. And it’s doing very well and they’re sterilizing, a lot of the mass can be sterilized up to 20 times. So that’s like buying 20 masks. And I always wondered why aren’t they sterilizing these masks? Some of them are pretty sophisticated masks. And some you can’t, because of the material, others you can, but we have actually two companies that do this, but one company I know very well in Ohio and they’re doing a great job. So they’re sterilizing masks up to 20 times, you can sterilize a certain type of mask. To these numbers in perspective and to put them into perspective, American healthcare providers use an estimated 25 million N95 masks nationwide in a typical year, so a typical year, 25 million."
2020-04-19,31:38,Donald Trump,"That means we’ve secured nearly four times as many N95 masks in recent weeks as we would an entire healthcare industry during a typical year. Over a matter of couple of weeks we had more masks than we would do in a year. Think of that, over a couple of weeks. Moreover, we’re bringing supply chains back home and we’ve learned a lot about supply chains. We’ve learned that it’s nice to make things in the U.S. I’ve been saying that for a long time. One of the reasons I ran for office, because we started making things everywhere but here. And if one thing comes out of this more than anything else, is that we should make product in the United States. And these supply chains, they sound wonderful, but if one country has a problem, the whole chain is ruined and I’ve been saying it for a long time. I ran partially on that. I ran partially on that. I ran on that and I ran very strongly against China. And then we made a great trade deal, where they buy $250 billion, they’re supposed to."
2020-04-19,32:46,Donald Trump,"And they’re paying tariffs, they paid us tens of billions of dollars. I’ve given 12 billion one year, 16 billion another year, 19 billion to our farmers and ranchers who were targeted. But I ran on China and other countries, the way they were ripping us off, they were ripping off our country. And China understood that, I mean, China fully understood that and they’re big, strong, smart people and I wasn’t friendly and it wasn’t a friendly situation. And we ended up making an incredible deal with China for tens of billions of dollars of product, 40 to $50 billion to the farmers. The most they ever spent was 15 to 16, now they’re supposed to spend 40 to 50. Now of course the virus came along and I’m not happy, I’m not happy. I let them know I’m not happy. So we had a great relationship with… we had a very bad relationship with China. Then we had a good relationship because we made a great deal, but we’re not happy."
2020-04-19,33:53,Donald Trump,"This is not a good thing that happened, came out of China, so we’re not in a position where we’re going to say much yet, but the deal itself is great. The deal is, it’s going to put many, many people to work in our country. But all of that has to be taken into account when you look at all of the people that are dying in our country, but all over the world, all over the world people are dying. I had a G-7 call and their economies are in tatters. They’re shattered, the G-7 countries. You have Japan and Germany and France, the different countries, Italy, look at what happened to Italy. Look at what happened to these countries. Look at what happened to Spain. Look what happened to Spain, how incredible, it’s just been shattered and so many other countries are shattered. So nobody ever thought this could have happened, a thing like this, it’s very, very sad."
2020-04-19,34:58,Donald Trump,"But if we’ve learned something, it’s about supply chains. I just saw yesterday, where when the auto industry gets back, they have a problem because there’s a supply chain going through a different country. And this has been going on for years, for decades. I always said it was no good. Why do you need a supply chain? Very simple, make your parts here. They get one part from this country, one part from that country. It’s all over the place. The problem is if one country has a problem, you have no car or whatever it is you’re making. So we’ve learned a good lesson. I think a lot of smart people knew that before, but we’ve distributed many hundreds of millions of masks. This pandemic has underscored the vital importance of reshoring our supply chains and bringing them back into the United States where they belong, where they should have never left. What happens if you’re in a war and you have a supply chain where half of your supplies are given to you by other countries? Who are the people that thought of this? These are globalists. It doesn’t work."
2020-04-19,36:03,Donald Trump,"It certainly doesn’t work during rough times, bad times or dangerous times. So we’re going to continue to fight the virus. We’re talking to China, we spoke to them a long time ago about going in, we want to go in, we want to see what’s going on and we weren’t exactly invited, I can tell you that. If you look at some of the investigations that are going on, in terms of World Health Organization and I’ll take it a step further, World Trade Organization too, World Trade. We did years ago, years ago, many years ago, the World Trade Organization, from the day China came in, that’s when China bloomed. They were mainlining it and then boom, they were up like a rocket ship because they took advantage of every little ridiculous clause in the World Trade Organization documents. They were developing nation, China was a developing nation."
2020-04-19,37:06,Donald Trump,"They make the cars, they make the plant, they make everything, they make everything and they’re a developing nation. I might’ve gotten elected to a certain extent because of China and other countries. One of my big things was trade, the United States is getting ripped off in trade. Now Japan is paying $40 billion and buying a lot. That’s before we even do the deal. U.S., Mexico was a great deal. The NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made in trade history. And I would also put the World Trade Organization in that same group. So I was very tough on these countries. With China, we made the deal and we became friendly. But then this happened and this is tantamount, this is something that’s really incredible. I do want to read something that I just saw today on television. I was looking and I just said, that’s an interesting statement. We talk about the Democrats and it was a statement made by Brett Baier, good guy, smart. On February 19th, there was a Democratic debate in Las Vegas. That was February 19th, that’s way after I closed entrance from China into our country."
2020-04-19,38:26,Donald Trump,"So Brett goes, “On February 19th there was a Democratic debate in Las Vegas. Three words weren’t said during the debate, virus, coronavirus or COVID-19, those three words never came up.” I just thought it was a very interesting, because you hear these people, some of the people, the Democrats said, oh, this that. It never even was a part of their dialogue. Now they bring it up because you see what happens now, but they didn’t bring it out. But I brought it up. I brought it up a long time before I made the trade deal and I was not easy to deal with. I was not easy to deal with. They understand that. We still have 25% of $250 billion that they have to pay us and it’s a lot of money. We’re taking in a lot of money and we’ve had a lot of beneficiaries, including our farmers and ranches."
2020-04-19,39:19,Donald Trump,"So in addition, we’ve launched an unprecedented effort to develop new treatments and therapies to battle the plague. Therapies to me are the most exciting, the vaccines are obviously so important, but the therapies are immediate. And we have some things that are really looking good, really looking good. We call COVID Treatment Acceleration Program. We’re accelerating all of these great companies that are looking, and we have government agencies looking too, N.I.H. This extraordinary program is slashing red tape to speed and development and to rival and if you look at what we’re doing in terms of the speed, it’s unrivaled, it’s totally unrivaled. There’s never been anything like it. The FDA and Dr. Stephen Hahn, a highly respected man from a great institution, left that job to come here."
2020-04-19,40:17,Donald Trump,"The job he’s doing is incredible and we’re working with Scott, his predecessor, is terrific. We’re working with a lot of people. But the speed of development for antiviral, antibody and immune therapies is at a level that nobody thought even possible. And I will say this, we’re getting very good results. It’s a little soon yet. But if we could find the therapies that would solve the problem, if somebody has a problem, we can get it taken care of so it’s not so devastating as it has been. With that, I’m going to ask Vice President Pence to come up and I have to say it’s a Sunday, Sunday evening and this man has not stopped. He’s working, we all are in all fairness, but he’s been working with this task force and everyone else round the clock for months and I just want to thank Mike. Thank you, Mike."
2020-04-19,41:09,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President. And let me echo your words about all the dedicated men and women on the White House coronavirus task force. And the team that you assembled in January, some of whom are with us today, Seema Verma with CMS, Admiral Giroir with U.S. public health service, Dr. Steve Hahn of the FDA and others represent a level of commitment and dedication, it’s been inspiring for me to have a privilege to work with. And so I thank you for your gracious words. That White House coronavirus task force met today. It was reported to us that at this moment, more than 746,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus. Fortunately, more than 68,000 Americans have fully recovered, but sadly more than 41,000 Americans have lost their lives to the coronavirus. And we always want to express our deepest sympathies to the families in their loss, as well as to all the families who have loved ones that are struggling with this disease."
2020-04-19,42:20,Mike Pence,"Today, we’ve seen encouraging news again about our progress as a nation. President Trump reflected on those momentarily, but the coronavirus White House task force today learned that our large metro areas continue to stabilize and even see progress. The New York metro area, including New Jersey, New York, Long Island, Connecticut, and Rhode Island all appeared to be past their peak. The Detroit metro area also appears to be past its peak and is stable. New Orleans metro area actually is the most stable of all areas where we had a major metropolitan outbreak. And the Denver metro area is stable. We’re dealing in Colorado with a meat packing plant issue. And of course, California and Washington remain low and steady. Areas that we continue to watch carefully on the task force, include the Chicago metro area, Boston metro, and the Philadelphia metropolitan area."
2020-04-19,43:24,Mike Pence,"The progress that we are making is a tribute to the American people. It’s a tribute to state and local leaders in all of these areas and the partnership that our president has forged. But we just want to encourage every American as we see this progress to continue to heed your state and local authorities. I think the American people know, no one wants to reopen America more than President Donald Trump, but I want to assure you we’re going to continue to work with the governors of every state, with the President’s guidelines for opening up America again, and we’re going to work in a way that we can consolidate the progress that we have made and help move our states toward reopening our country. We also received a report today in the coronavirus task force at this point, 5,528 military personnel have been deployed across 24 hospitals and facilities and 28,700 National Guard are on duty."
2020-04-19,44:33,Mike Pence,"On the subject of supplies, the President spoke about this at length, but at the present moment we have more than 9,055 ventilators on hand. We actually added 91 ventilators to that supply because of the production that the president and our task force at FEMA has activated. In the next seven days, we’ll be adding 576 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile. As the President mentioned, our Air Bridge continues to work. 64 flights completed, 50 more slights on the horizon, literally bringing in medical equipment from around the country and around the world and deploying it to critical areas. Finally, tomorrow as the President announced, we’ll be hosting a conference call with all of the nation’s governors, all the states and territories from the headquarters at FEMA."
2020-04-19,45:26,Mike Pence,"And we’ll be working with the governors to ensure them that we’re helping them to review and evaluate the President’s guidelines for opening up America again. The criteria that we believe is appropriate and necessary before states can move into any phase one change in the mitigation strategies, but also at the President’s direction tomorrow. We’ll be providing all the nation’s governors and all of their health officials with detail about the testing infrastructure that exists all around the country. We’ll be specifically providing-"
2020-04-19,46:02,Mike Pence,"… this all around the country. We’ll be specifically providing governors and state health officials with information about all of the lab capability that exists in their states, and also we’ll be updating them on our efforts to identify the kind of supplies the president just held up and our efforts to make sure that those supplies are at all of those laboratories as the need should arise. Remember that a month ago we had done 80,000 Coronavirus tests in America. This weekend we cleared more than 4 million, and we’re currently testing more than a million Americans a week. We fully expect to actually have tested more than 5 million Americans before the end of this month, but at the president’s urging, we’re going to continue to scale that testing and then work with governors to make sure that they can manage and implement and deploy that testing in the manner that will most support their efforts to move their states forward."
2020-04-19,46:59,Mike Pence,"Remember that the testing that is contemplated in the guidelines for opening up America again for phase one are testing people that have symptoms that may be Coronavirus and then also having the testing resources to deploy to vulnerable communities, nursing homes, or other vulnerable communities that we have identified as needing additional, what is called monitoring or surveillance testing. We believe we have the testing today around the country that would allow any state in America to move into phase one if they’ve met the other criteria, 14 days of consistent declines and strong hospital capacity so that their system would not be overwhelmed in the event of a flare-up. But we’re going to be working with governors tomorrow on the subject of testing and supplies. And as president said again this evening, we’re here to help. We’ve forged a partnership with governors around the country, and tomorrow we’ll be building on that partnership to hopefully arrive at the day that we can make sure governors around the nation have the best advice and the best resources to put America back to work. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-19,48:15,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike. Very good. Seema, you’ve done such a great job. Please come up and say a couple of words. Thank you."
2020-04-19,48:24,Seema Verma,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Mr. President. So just a few weeks ago we stood here and asked the American healthcare system to delay elective surgeries and procedures. And the reason why we did this is we wanted to make sure that the healthcare system could deal with any surges. We wanted to preserve equipment, make sure that they had the appropriate workforce to handle any surge. And our healthcare system did a fantastic job. They very quickly stood up telehealth services, and under the president’s leadership, we started paying for these services under the Medicare program. But the reality is not everything can be addressed by telehealth. There may be a woman that needs surgery for breast cancer, somebody who has cataracts in their eyes that need to be able to see better, and sometimes a doctor just needs to be able to listen to their patient’s heart. We’ve heard across the country that doctor’s offices have closed and many healthcare systems are furloughing their staff, nurses, and doctors."
2020-04-19,49:22,Seema Verma,"Under the president’s leadership, we’ve put out over $90 billion in accelerated payments under the Medicare program, provided $30 billion of grants, with more dollars on the way. But thanks to the American people, we are in a much different place. You heard from the vice president that there are many places around the country where they’re seeing a decline in cases, and hospitals are reporting that they have unused capacity. And so as part of our opening up America, we are issuing guidelines today about how we can reopen the healthcare system. So these are recommendations around phase one. Now, every state and local official has to assess the situation on the ground. They need to make sure that they can still address surges. They need to make sure that they have adequate supplies and a plan for conserving supplies. They need to be able to screen patients and health care workers for COVID virus. And they need to make sure that patients feel safe when they come in to seek healthcare services by assuring that they have the appropriate cleaning in place and that they observe social distancing inside the healthcare facilities."
2020-04-19,50:35,Seema Verma,"And this isn’t going to be like a light switch. It’s more like a sunrise where it’s going to be a gradual process. And healthcare officials across the country and healthcare systems need to decide what services should be made available, and ultimately doctors and patients need to make decisions about their healthcare services. And we want to make sure that systems are reopening so that they can stay open and doing that in a very measured way. And I want to thank all the healthcare workers on the front lines who’ve done a fantastic job in providing care and comfort, serving as a liaison between family members. They’ve done a fantastic job, and we owe a debt of gratitude to them and to all those providers that did adhere to our guidelines. They did the right thing, and it has made an extraordinary difference."
2020-04-19,51:25,Seema Verma,"Also want to take a couple of seconds here to talk about our nursing homes. Our hearts and minds are with the patients and the families of those living in nursing homes. This is an extraordinarily difficult situation. People living in nursing homes are of the most vulnerable patients. They’re elderly. Many of them have underlying health conditions. And this has been a very hard situation, and I really appreciate the strong efforts of governors and local communities that have shown great leadership in supporting homes across the country, particularly Governor Baker, Governor Hogan, that have had special efforts around supporting nursing homes. FEMA is also working on a plan to make sure that nursing homes have the supplies that they need. And just last week we increased the reimbursement in the Medicare program for high throughput tests, and we are also paying for labs to go out to nursing homes to collect samples, and that’s going to really support efforts on nursing homes in order to isolate patients."
2020-04-19,52:27,Seema Verma,"Today we are also announcing under the president’s leadership an effort around nursing home transparency. It’s important that patients and their families have the information that they need, and they need to understand what’s going on in the nursing home. And so today we are announcing that we are requiring nursing homes to report to patients and their families if there are cases of COVID virus inside the nursing home. We are also requiring nursing homes to report directly to the CDC when they have cases of COVID virus. And this is very important, as you’ve heard Dr. Birx talk about. As we reopen the United States, our surveillance effort around the COVID virus will also begin in nursing homes. And so by having this reporting system, this will support CDC’s efforts to have surveillance around the country and to support efforts around contact tracing so that we can mitigate the spread of the virus in those communities that show spreads starting in the nursing homes. So again, I want to thank all of the local officials that have done an amazing job in supporting the nursing homes and would urge all state and local leaders to follow their lead and do everything that we can to keep nursing home residents safe. Thank you."
2020-04-19,53:41,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. And Dr. Hahn is here. If you need to, he’ll tell you maybe a little bit later if you want this, but I can tell you that very simply, the level at which they’re approving things, tests, and being on top of the people that are doing the testing for therapies and for vaccines, they’ve never seen anything like this. So I want to thank you very much. And stick around. Maybe they’ll have some questions, okay? Please go ahead, in the back."
2020-04-19,54:14,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you very much. If there were groups of people planning to protest tomorrow against the government shutdown, what would be your advice?"
2020-04-19,54:24,Donald Trump,Against the shutdown?
2020-04-19,54:26,Unnamed,"Well, that they want the shutdown lifted. Should that be okay?"
2020-04-19,54:28,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:54:30]. People feel that way. You’re allowed to protest. I mean, they feel that way. I watched the protest, and they were all six feet apart. I bet it was a very orderly group of people, but some have gone too far. Some governors have gone too far. Some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate, and I think in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re starting to open up our states. And I think they’re going to open up very well. We’re going to be watching it. We’re going to be watching it very closely. We’re working with them on testing. We’re working with them on whatever they need. I don’t think they need ventilators anymore. I believe the term the governor used was phenomenal. We’ve done a phenomenal job. That was the only sentence they left out, which is okay, but I appreciate that that’s what Governor Cuomo said. These people have done a phenomenal job. As far as protesters, I see protestors for all sorts of things, and I’m with everybody. I’m with everybody. Please in the back, go ahead. In the back, go ahead. You ready? Yeah."
2020-04-19,55:35,Unnamed,"Yes, please. Thank you, Mr. President. Jenn Pellegrino, OAN. Yesterday you pointed out that Ron was likely not truthful in a reporting of the virus. Meanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein and other democrats are looking for $5 million in aid to Iran. Are you considering giving any aid to Iran?"
2020-04-19,55:55,Donald Trump,"If Iran needed aid on this, I would be willing to do something if they want it. If they ask for it, I would be certainly willing. They were hit very hard. Obviously, those numbers weren’t correct numbers that they reported, but if they needed help, if they needed aid, if they needed ventilators, we have thousands of ventilators currently on hand and ventilators that are under construction. That’s a mosquito. I don’t like mosquitoes. I don’t like mosquitoes at all, but yeah, we would certainly be willing to help. What they should do is be smart and make a deal. It’s only because of you look at what happened, John Kerry I guess just doesn’t want them to make a deal. And they’re probably figuring they could wait, and maybe it will be Biden, and they’ll own America if Biden gets… And they know with me doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t work that way. If Joe Biden got in, they’d own America. Between them, China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, they’d own America. You wouldn’t have a country left if he got in. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-19,57:05,Unnamed,"Mr. President, the first question you mentioned that you’ve seen some governors… I think you said this yesterday too… that some governors you think have gone too far. Which governors are you referring to sir? Which states."
2020-04-19,57:15,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to mention names specifically, but obviously, one we can mention that’s this, but really much beyond this is Virginia with what they’ve done on guns. He is playing with your second amendment. We can’t allow that to happen. And that is indirectly related to this because you know what’s happened with guns. People are buying guns at a level that you haven’t seen before because of this surge of plague. So what he did was totally inappropriate. Other than that, I’m not going to mention governors, but I have a list, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
2020-04-19,57:50,Unnamed,"On Monday, sir, you mentioned off the top that you hope that a deal may come tomorrow on the small business loan program."
2020-04-19,57:56,Donald Trump,"Well, I hope so."
2020-04-19,57:57,Unnamed,"But this morning, Mnuchin seemed like this was ready to go. It seemed like any second now."
2020-04-19,58:01,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. Whatever it is, yeah."
2020-04-19,58:01,Unnamed,Is there any change there?
2020-04-19,58:03,Donald Trump,"Every time you say it’s ready to go, then they say, “Oh, we have a good negotiating position now because he just said it’s ready to go.” So now let’s see what happens, but we want to take care of our workers. We want to take care of our small businesses. They’re really the engine of this country. When we open, we want to have those small businesses ready to go. We don’t want those businesses abandoned because they couldn’t afford their employees, they couldn’t take care, and I want to take care of those employees."
2020-04-19,58:31,Unnamed,"So what’s the holdup now, sir?"
2020-04-19,58:31,Donald Trump,"[inaudible 00:58:32]. I can’t tell you that. I can just tell you that we’re negotiating with the democrats, and they negotiate for things that we can’t do, that we don’t think are in the best interest of the people of this country. We are very close to a deal. I can’t tell you whether or not we’re going to get the deal or not. Who would say that? You want me to say we’re going to have a deal before we have a deal? [crosstalk 00:58:53]. We have a good chance of getting a deal. A lot of good discussions were had today. We have a good chance of getting the deal. We want the deal. We want to take care of our workers. We want to take care of our small companies. [crosstalk 00:13:06]. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-19,59:08,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for you and also for Dr. Hahn, if I may [inaudible 00:59:14]."
2020-04-19,59:12,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-04-19,59:13,Unnamed,"In your remarks that you made just a few moments ago in regards to reopening the US economy, you said, “I want it to be safe.” And that’s a sentiment obviously shared by-"
2020-04-19,59:25,Donald Trump,"I do. No, I want it to be safe."
2020-04-19,59:26,Unnamed,Tens of millions of Americans.
2020-04-19,59:27,Donald Trump,"I want it to be safe, absolutely."
2020-04-19,59:28,Unnamed,"And it seems at odds, Mr. President, with the tweet that you had on Friday about liberating those three particular states, Virginia, Minnesota, and Michigan, because none of those states, Mr. President have met the requirements that the vice president and others on the task force have talked about in terms of reopening the economy. Do you see those two-"
2020-04-19,59:48,Donald Trump,"Well, if you take Michigan, there were things in Michigan that I don’t think they were necessary or appropriate. Everyone knows that. I think the governor of Michigan… We’re getting along very well, but I think the governor of Michigan probably knows that. I think she probably wished she didn’t put some of them in. You can’t buy paint. You can’t buy seeds. I mean, where did this stuff come from? No, no. We’re going to be safe. We have to be safe. We don’t want to close anything. We’re not going to be closing, but we’re going to be doing it beautifully, systematically. We’re working very well with the governors, I mean, I would say pretty much almost all of them. A couple of them, no matter what you do, you’ll never satisfy them. You could find a cure tomorrow, and they wouldn’t be satisfied. They’d find a reason to complain. Wise guys. But for the most part, we’re working very well with the governors. We have a great relationship with the governors."
2020-04-19,01:00:35,Donald Trump,"I can tell you I’ve been on numerous calls with governors, and during those calls, I mean, without exception they were friendly, and that’s going back even a month from today. So I think that we’re going to do a terrific job. I think the governors are going to do a terrific job, but we’re starting to open our country. And as you know, I just spoke with Greg Abbott today from Texas. He’s fantastic. He’s a fantastic governor, and he’s going to be opening up parts of Texas. And you’re going to be opening up parts of other states. And you know what that is. And by the way, other countries are at a point where they’re starting… I see where Germany is starting to open up little sections."
2020-04-19,01:01:13,Donald Trump,"So there are a lot of great things happening, and we’re going to start to open our country, and we’re going to do it. As I say, it’s like a beautiful puzzle. The state, might even be a portion of a state. There are very big states, and you can have portions of states, Mike. You have a portion. You have a county, which is perfect, and you have another county that’s sort of still pretty far away, even if it’s within the same state, and it’s not doing so well, but they may open up part. So we’re going to do it very, very carefully, and I think it’s going to be a very successful, but when you say safe, I want it to be very safe."
2020-04-19,01:01:52,Unnamed,Dr. Hahn-
2020-04-19,01:01:52,Unnamed,"[Crosstalk 01:01:52]. Mr. President, thank you very much."
2020-04-19,01:01:57,Donald Trump,"Let him just do this one. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-19,01:01:57,Unnamed,"Thank you very much, Dr. Hahn."
2020-04-19,01:01:59,Donald Trump,Doctor.
2020-04-19,01:02:00,Unnamed,"There’s a question that I don’t know the answer to that I was hoping that you to provide an answer to. There’s an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama in Birmingham who’s actually a COVID-19 survivor, and his name is Michael Saag. And his question is this, why would the virus suddenly be different? And why would people’s susceptibility be any different on May the 1st or on June the 1st or on July the 1st? And this all relates to reopening the economy. Can you explain or give an answer to that particular question?"
2020-04-19,01:02:37,Dr. Steven Hahn,"I don’t think we have evidence that one would be more susceptible or less. What I think we can say is that the mitigation efforts have really helped with respect to this and that what we’ve seen is the number of cases have gone down. And if we follow the gating criteria for the opening, we’re then able to institute phase one and have appropriate measures in place to actually reduce any chance of flare-up of the cases."
2020-04-19,01:03:03,Unnamed,Is there a chance of sort of rebounding if you reopen too soon without the type of mitigation efforts that we’ve had still in place?
2020-04-19,01:03:13,Mike Pence,"Yes, there’s a chance. And I think Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx talked about this at the podium. And the key here is the surveillance that is being put in place with the CDC. Think that’ll be a really great help in terms of trying to reduce that risk. Thank you."
2020-04-19,01:03:28,Donald Trump,"And I think they have the rest of that clip. I just thought it was a very good clip. I think it’s a tribute to New York. I think it’s a tribute to the federal government, and I thought it was nice. So I think they have that now. They can try it. Go ahead."
2020-04-19,01:03:40,Unnamed,"Have we saved everyone? No. But have we lost anyone because we didn’t have a bed or we didn’t have a ventilator or we didn’t have healthcare staff? No. The people we lost are the people we couldn’t save, not for lack of trying and not for lack of doing everything that we could do as a society, not only as a government, and as a healthcare system."
2020-04-19,01:04:18,Donald Trump,Okay.
2020-04-19,01:04:21,Weijia Jiang,"Mr. President, you had called on me."
2020-04-19,01:04:21,Donald Trump,"Yes, I did."
2020-04-19,01:04:22,Weijia Jiang,"I appreciate it. Since you shared with us something else that you saw on TV today, I have a question about something you said on Thursday, which is that you were angry because information about the virus should have been told to us earlier and a lot sooner. People knew it was happening, and people did not want to talk about it. Many Americans are saying the exact same thing about you, that you should’ve warned them the virus was spreading like wildfire through the month of February instead of holding rallies with thousands of people. Why did you wait so long-"
2020-04-19,01:04:55,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-04-19,01:04:55,Weijia Jiang,To warn them?
2020-04-19,01:04:55,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-04-19,01:04:57,Weijia Jiang,And why did you not have social distancing until March 16th.
2020-04-19,01:05:01,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-04-19,01:05:02,Weijia Jiang,I’m we Weijia Jiang with CBS News.
2020-04-19,01:05:04,Donald Trump,So if you look at what I did in terms of cutting off or banning China from coming in-
2020-04-19,01:05:13,Weijia Jiang,"Chinese nationals, but by the way, not Americans who are also coming from China."
2020-04-19,01:05:17,Donald Trump,"Nice and easy, nice and easy. Just relax. We cut it off. People were amazed. These gentlemen, everybody was amazed that I did it. We had 21 people in a room. Everybody was against it but me. Dr. Fauci said had I not done that, perhaps tens of thousands, or maybe much more than that, people would’ve died. I was very early, very, very early. You we just saw, you saw, Brett Baier making a statement. They had a debate well into February and not even mentioned. It wasn’t even mentioned. The democrats-"
2020-04-19,01:05:51,Weijia Jiang,You’re the president. You should’ve warned people-
2020-04-19,01:05:53,Donald Trump,I’m the president. And you know what I just did?
2020-04-19,01:05:55,Weijia Jiang,That it was spreading so quickly.
2020-04-19,01:05:55,Donald Trump,And you know what I just-
2020-04-19,01:05:56,Weijia Jiang,"And by the way, when you issued the ban, the virus was already here."
2020-04-19,01:06:00,Donald Trump,"Okay. And you know how many people when I issued the ban, how many cases of virus were in the United States when I issued the ban? Do you know the number?"
2020-04-19,01:06:08,Weijia Jiang,There was-
2020-04-19,01:06:09,Donald Trump,"No, no. How many cases? Remember I said one person. How many cases were here when I issued the ban? Tell me."
2020-04-19,01:06:14,Weijia Jiang,But you know it was going to spread and become a pandemic?
2020-04-19,01:06:15,Donald Trump,"No, no, no. You have to do your research."
2020-04-19,01:06:16,Weijia Jiang,I did my research. On the 23rd of March you said you knew this was going to be a pandemic-
2020-04-19,01:06:22,Donald Trump,Can I tell what?
2020-04-19,01:06:22,Weijia Jiang,Well before-
2020-04-19,01:06:22,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 01:06:23]. I did know it. I did know it. All I have to do is look.
2020-04-19,01:06:25,Weijia Jiang,So you knew it was going to spread?
2020-04-19,01:06:25,Donald Trump,"Well, anybody knew it. Are you ready? How many cases were in the United States when I did my ban? How many people had died in the United States."
2020-04-19,01:06:34,Weijia Jiang,So do you acknowledge that you didn’t think it was going to spread?
2020-04-19,01:06:35,Donald Trump,Keep your voice down please. Keep your voice down.
2020-04-19,01:06:37,Weijia Jiang,Did you not know it was going to spread?
2020-04-19,01:06:38,Donald Trump,How many cases were in the United States? I did a band where I’m closing up the entire country. How many people died?
2020-04-19,01:06:47,Weijia Jiang,And that’s a fair point.
2020-04-19,01:06:48,Donald Trump,"How many people died in the United States? And yet I closed up the country, and I believe there were no deaths, zero deaths at the time I closed up the country. Nobody was there. And you should say thank you very much for good judgment. Go ahead please."
2020-04-19,01:07:04,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you just mentioned Germany. Germany is allowing small stores to open tomorrow."
2020-04-19,01:07:10,Donald Trump,"Yes, they are. I just spoke to them."
2020-04-19,01:07:11,Unnamed,Does this give you confidence that some European countries are on the mend of recovering?
2020-04-19,01:07:16,Donald Trump,"Well, I hope so. We hope it works out. [crosstalk 00:21:19]. I spoke with Angela, and they’re going to start a process of opening very much like we are. We are too. I spoke with numerous governors. They’re doing it also, areas where number one, they’ve done a good job and where they don’t have much of a problem. Germany is starting the process also, yes, and I’m very happy about that. Some places in Europe, as you know, can’t start the process for a while. Yes ma’am. Go ahead please."
2020-04-19,01:07:44,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. I have two Nevada questions. First one, the mayor of Las Vegas thinks it’s total insanity for business to be shut down in Nevada, which Governor Sisolak ordered. Who’s right?"
2020-04-19,01:07:58,Donald Trump,"Well, they shut one of my hotels down too, okay? I’m not involved in that. I could be if I wanted to. I just chose not to be. By the way, just so you know, I could be if I wanted to, but I chose not, but they closed a very big hotel that I have in Nevada down in Las Vegas. It’s a very severe step he took. I’m okay with it. I’m okay with it. But you could call that one either way. I know the mayor is very upset with it. Some owners are very upset with it. Some of the developers out there very upset. Others they say, “Hey, we got to get rid of it.” I can see both sides of that."
2020-04-19,01:08:33,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:22:34]. I’ll give one other question. I asked you recently about an SBA rule that said that paycheck protection money could not go to small casinos. You said you’d look into it, but clearly something happened."
2020-04-19,01:08:44,Donald Trump,"They are looking into it right now because they have small casinos that don’t have too many people, and they’re going to make a ruling, I understand, next week."
2020-04-19,01:08:53,Unnamed,"They already did make a ruling, and they changed it from small casinos that make more than a third of their income couldn’t qualify to half-"
2020-04-19,01:09:00,Donald Trump,"I know, but they are continuing to look at that. It’s a big topic."
2020-04-19,01:09:03,Donald Trump,But they’re looking at that. They’re continuing to look at that. It’s a big topic. We’ve got a lot of people involved. [crosstalk 01:09:06] Let’s give it a shot.
2020-04-19,01:09:09,Unnamed,"Thank you. Governor Cuomo, as you played in that clip, has indeed praised a lot of what the federal government has done, but he-"
2020-04-19,01:09:15,Donald Trump,"Excuse me. Excuse me. He didn’t say a lot. He said we did a phenomenal job. He didn’t say a lot. He didn’t say, “You did a good job on ventilators, but nothing else.” No. He said we did a phenomenal job, so report accurately because you are one of the most inaccurate reporters. Go ahead."
2020-04-19,01:09:31,Unnamed,"What he has said is that, and along with a bunch of Republican governors, who have said what they need though is a national strategy when it comes to testing because on supplies they say that they’re competing against one another."
2020-04-19,01:09:40,Donald Trump,They said the same thing with ventilators and now we have so many that we’re going to be able to send them and help other countries that are in need. We’re doing great on testing and we are actually using the act as you know on a certain [crosstalk 01:09:52].
2020-04-19,01:09:51,Unnamed,"On swabs, but what about on the reagents? They’ve said that that’s something that they can’t-"
2020-04-19,01:09:54,Donald Trump,"We’re in great shape. It’s so easy to get. Reagents and swabs are so easy to get. When you have to build a very expensive piece of machinery controlled by computers, that’s a different thing, and no, everything’s going to be in very good shape very soon. We’re going to be in very good shape very soon. Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-04-19,01:10:15,Unnamed,"Mr. President, just the latest stimulus package. Will that have funding for states and local governments? Mr.-"
2020-04-19,01:10:22,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t want to comment on it, but we will be saving that for another time."
2020-04-19,01:10:27,Unnamed,Will you be willing-
2020-04-19,01:10:28,Donald Trump,"And by the way, so states and local governments need it. I’m the first one to admit that. We’re going to be saving that for another little bit of a later date, will probably be our next negotiation, but I’m in favor of it, I will say, and I told the Republicans today. I had, I think, a great talk with a Republican senators today, and all of them, I think, just about all of them, and a conference call, and that’ll be a very big topic over the next a couple of weeks. It’s very important."
2020-04-19,01:11:03,Unnamed,What is the administration doing to make sure that hotel chains and hedge funds [crosstalk 01:11:06]-
2020-04-19,01:11:05,Donald Trump,"Well that’s another one. Yeah. That’s another one. You have hotels that are a big mess of buildings that are under levered, but if you have no income at all coming out, no income at all, these hotels, they go from under levered to they have to be closed down. It’s a terrible thing. I don’t know that they’re working on that specific problem, but it’s a problem they should be talking about. I mean you have people that own a hotel where they go from having a very successful hotel with many employees, thousands of people, to all of a sudden closing it down. I read where my wonderful place in Florida, in Miami, Doral, they had let a lot of the employees go because it’s essentially closed. You can’t use it. You can’t have the restaurants. So you have to close it down."
2020-04-19,01:11:52,Donald Trump,"That’s an example. Many, many hotels are closing down throughout the country and hopefully they’re going to be able to open up relatively quickly."
2020-04-19,01:12:00,Unnamed,But the funds were specifically for small businesses. Would the administration make sure-
2020-04-19,01:12:03,Donald Trump,"Well, it depends how the hotel’s considered. Is it owned by a big chain? But even if it’s owned by a big chain, that’s devastating. If they have 200 hotels in the country and they’re closed, and it’s not only in the country, remember this, this is all over the world. They could have 2000 hotels that are in other countries. They’re also closed. We’re in better shape than most when you think about it. So I think we’re going to be looking at it. I think it’s a very big problem and it’s a lot of people employed. Yeah, here we go."
2020-04-19,01:12:34,Unnamed,"Mr. President, more than 22 million Americans are currently unemployed as a result of this. Today we hit the grim milestone of more than 40,000 Americans now having died from the coronavirus. Can you explain then why you come out here and you were reading clips and showing clips of praise for you and for your administration? Is this really the time for self-congratulations?"
2020-04-19,01:12:59,Donald Trump,"I will tell you this. What I’m doing is I’m standing up for the men and women that have done such an incredible job, not for me, for the men and women, admirals, Vice President, if I might, but all of the men and women, thousands, tens of thousands of them, they built hospitals in New York and New Jersey and all over this country in record time. They’d throw up a thousand beds in four days. I’m sticking up for those people. Those people have been incredible. I’m also sticking up for doctors and nurses and military doctors and nurses."
2020-04-19,01:13:33,Unnamed,But the clips that you played and what you read earlier was praising you and your administration-
2020-04-19,01:13:36,Donald Trump,"All I played today was Governor Cuomo [crosstalk 01:13:38] saying very positive things about the job the federal government has done [crosstalk 00:04:43]. Those people have been just absolutely excoriated by some of the fake news like you. You’re CNN. You’re fake news, and let me just tell you, they were excoriated by people like you that don’t know any better because you don’t have the brains you were born with. You should be praising the people that have done a good job, not doing what you do, even that question. So just so you understand-"
2020-04-19,01:14:05,Unnamed,"The question is why now, sir. The question is why now, not why are you doing it, but why now?"
2020-04-19,01:14:08,Donald Trump,"I’ll tell you why now. Are you ready? Because these people are right now in hospitals. It’s dangerous. It’s going to a battlefield, and I want these people, I want you, [crosstalk 01:14:19] It’s all about that. It’s not about me. [crosstalk 01:14:23]"
2020-04-19,01:14:24,Donald Trump,"Nothing’s about me. Look, you’re never going to treat me fairly, many of you, and I understand that. I don’t even know, I got here with the worst, most unfair press treatment they say in the history of the United States for a President. They did say Abraham Lincoln had very bad treatment, too. Let me just-"
2020-04-19,01:14:41,Unnamed,"Sir, the Wall Street Journal online I just read has your name in it. It talks about Trump’s remaking the playbook."
2020-04-19,01:14:44,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s a positive thing because that’s an exercise in how to do it and what to do and that’s good for the future. People can learn from that. But I want the men and women of this country that are in danger, the admirals and the generals that have done a job like they’ve never done before, they’re in war. We’re in war. You know, I call it the invisible enemy. That’s their war and it’s a dangerous war. We’re also at a level when you said 40,000 people, and you’re right, almost 40,000 people and-"
2020-04-19,01:15:12,Unnamed,More than.
2020-04-19,01:15:12,Donald Trump,"Oh, more than, okay, good. Correct me."
2020-04-19,01:15:15,Unnamed,"41,000."
2020-04-19,01:15:15,Donald Trump,"Correct me. Good. Well, I’m really glad you corrected me, CNN, but here’s the story. Let me just tell you something. If we didn’t do what we did, the 40,000 right now could be a million people. It could be a million people, not 40,000. it could be a million. We’re tracking at much less than the lowest possible estimate, and that’s a great tribute to a number of people in a number of things. One of the things that it’s attributed to is what’s taken place in this country with the American people because they’ve gone inside. They’ve done it. They’ve done a job that nobody thought was possible, and in fact, when they did the models, as they call them, nobody thought it was possible. They did models not based on this kind of success."
2020-04-19,01:15:59,Donald Trump,"I’ve seen New York streets and I see it in the morning. I’ve watched all my life, New York streets, and you can’t even see the pavement, there’s so many people. And you take a look this morning, you take a look even on Friday morning, I looked at it. I saw it through a camera. There wasn’t a person on Fifth Avenue. There wasn’t a person on Madison Avenue. I’ve never seen anything like it because people have really listened to instructions, and they’ve listened to what we’ve had to say, and the professionals, they’ve listened, and people should really give them a lot of credit, including people like you, because you just don’t have the sense to understand what’s going on. All right. Yeah, please, go ahead."
2020-04-19,01:16:37,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Publicly traded companies like Shake Shack, and Quantum Corp, and Ruth’s Chris, should they have access to the PPP program?"
2020-04-19,01:16:46,Donald Trump,"Well, it would depend. It would depend. I don’t know much about any of those companies, but a lot of times they’re owned by franchisees where they own one or two places, and you know they are small businesses, so that would depend on what the formula is. But again, many of those companies are out to franchisees. A franchisee could open up one of the places that you mentioned and so yeah, I would say that’s important, actually. That’s like a restaurant. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-19,01:17:15,Unnamed,"You know, you referred these protests in earlier. Some of them are getting pretty intense and we’re actually getting some death threats to some governors who are reluctant-"
2020-04-19,01:17:22,Donald Trump,You are in the media?
2020-04-19,01:17:23,Unnamed,"No, the governors are getting death threats. Governors in Kentucky, Michigan, Virginia, they’re getting increased levels of death threats. Are you concerned that your talk about liberation the second amendment, are you inciting violence among a few people who are-"
2020-04-19,01:17:36,Donald Trump,"I’ve seen the people. I’ve seen the interviews of the people. These are great people. Look, they want to get, they call cabin fever, you’ve heard the term. They’ve got cabin fever. They want to get back. They want their life back. Their life was taken away from them, and you know, they learned a lot during this period. They learned to do things differently than they have in the past and they’ll do it hopefully until the virus has passed. And when the virus passes, I hope we’re going to be sitting next to each other and baseball games, football games, basketball games, ice hockey games. I hope we’re going to be sitting next to each other. I hope you have golf. The Masters is going to have 100,000 people, not 25 people watching at the course."
2020-04-19,01:18:19,Unnamed,Are you [inaudible 01:18:20] [crosstalk 01:18:18]-
2020-04-19,01:18:20,Donald Trump,"No, I’m not. I’ve never seen so many American flags. I mean I, I’m seeing the same thing that you’re seeing. I don’t see it any differently."
2020-04-19,01:18:28,Donald Trump,They’re who?
2020-04-19,01:18:28,Unnamed,Nazis.
2020-04-19,01:18:29,Donald Trump,"Well that I totally would say no way, but I didn’t see that. I see all, of course, I’m sure the news plays that up. I’ve seen American flags all over the place. I have never seen so many American flags at a rally as I have in these rallies. These people love our country. They want to get back to work. [crosstalk 01:18:50] Please go ahead."
2020-04-19,01:18:51,Unnamed,"Mr. President, have you thought any more about pardoning Paul Manafort or Roger Stone so they’re not exposed to the coronavirus in jail?"
2020-04-19,01:18:58,Donald Trump,"Well, I just tell you this. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly. Paul Manafort, the black book turned out to be a fraud. We learned that out during the various last number of weeks or months. They had a black book that came out of Ukraine, turned out to be a fraud. Turned out to be a fraud. They convicted a man, turned out to be a fraud. General Flynn was a highly respected person and it turned out to be a scam on him. The FBI said he didn’t lie and Mueller’s people wanted him to go to jail. Okay? So what am I going to do? You’ll find out what I’m going to do. I’m not going to say what I’m going to do, but I will tell you the whole thing turned out to be a scam, and it turned out to be a disgrace to our country, and it was a take down of a duly elected President."
2020-04-19,01:19:46,Donald Trump,"And these people suffered greatly. General Flynn, I mean what they did to him, and even the FBI said, and they had some, and nobody bigger fan of the FBI than me at the level of the people that really matter. But the top of the FBI was scum, and what they did to General Flynn, and you know it and everybody knows it, was a disgrace. He was in the service for over 30 years. He ends up being a general and respected, respected, and almost his first day in office, they come in with papers. They want to investigate him. Never happened before and now the tables are turned. Investigate the investigators, I guess. These were crooked people. These are bad people. These are very dangerous people. You know what they are though? They’re scum. They’re human scum. You want to have one in the back? Please."
2020-04-19,01:20:42,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. The CDC has finally admitted to profound failures with testing kits from the beginning of the outbreak. Is this a function of lax oversight from the Obama/Biden administration?"
2020-04-19,01:20:54,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s not from me. I mean, they came in and they had some problems early on, but we’ve straightened it out. But yeah, look, I told you we inherited a lot of garbage. They had tests that were no good. They had all this stuff was no good. Came from somewhere, so whoever came up with it, but I’m proud to tell you that now we went from having a lot of bad things happening in CDC to having great things happening. They’re doing a very good job now. But no, initially, look, our stockpiles were empty. We had horrible stockpiles. We had horrible ventilators. We had very few of them, too, and so did the states have very few of them. But all of these things are now we’re at a level that we’ve never been. Same with our military. Our military is the strongest it’s ever been."
2020-04-19,01:21:40,Donald Trump,"We spent one and a half trillion dollars on our military. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. It’s never been at a position, and we even have Space Force. Mike and I were talking about what an achievement that is. First time in 72 years we have a new force. So yeah, CDC had obsolete tests, old tests, broken tests and a mess. But they’ve done a very good job, and they’ve done it under pressure. They had to do this under pressure, so we’re very proud of the job they’ve done. Please go ahead."
2020-04-19,01:22:09,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you’ve said swabs are easy, and this has been something that hospitals in the states have been saying there are shortages for more than a month now. Why wait to use the Defense Production Act until now?"
2020-04-19,01:22:20,Donald Trump,"Well, we already have millions coming in. We have one company that we’re forced to use it with, and probably by tomorrow we won’t be. You know it’s a tremendous hammer. Probably by tomorrow it won’t be, but we have millions of them coming in. They’re very easy. And in all fairness, governors could get them themselves. They really could. All of this, but we’re going to do it. We’re going to work with the governors, and if they can’t do it, we’re going to do it. If they do it, we can do it maybe cheaper, better. We’re getting very high quality. With us, it’s all quality, too. Even if it takes a little bit longer, we want the highest quality in all of it, including the ventilators. So yeah, we have millions of them coming in very soon and many of them already have been ordered, and the governors don’t know quite where they are, but they’ll be finding them fairly soon."
2020-04-19,01:23:12,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:23:12] Mr. President.
2020-04-19,01:23:14,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-19,01:23:14,Unnamed,"On President Xi, you now talk about the missteps that China made early on in this crisis and how it put the United States-"
2020-04-19,01:23:22,Donald Trump,"Well, based on an investigation we’re going to find out. Yeah."
2020-04-19,01:23:24,Unnamed,So when you repeatedly praised Xi in January and February [crosstalk 01:23:29] you said he will solve the problem. You said he was doing a great job. Where you duped by President Xi?
2020-04-19,01:23:35,Donald Trump,"No, no, no, no. I made a deal that’s phenomenal for the United States. No, you know who was duped? You, and the Obama administration were duped for years because China was ripping off this country. Like in the history of any country, nobody’s been ripped off like the United States by China and many other countries. And we stop it, and we’ve done a deal where they’re paying us 250, they are buying 250, they didn’t do anything for us. You know, we didn’t even have a deal. It was so bad. [crosstalk 01:24:05] No, no. It is about a deal because the deal started a long time ago before anybody heard about this. The deal was finished a number of months ago. Very happy, I was very happy. I hope they were happy. Billions of dollars came in in tariffs, billions of dollars. They’re going to be purchasing billions."
2020-04-19,01:24:26,Donald Trump,"And then all of a sudden long after that, I find out about this, [crosstalk 01:24:31] and I told you, I told you I’m not. [crosstalk 01:24:33] Listen, listen CNN. Listen CNN. I told you I’m not happy about it. And this was after the deal. So we have this wonderful deal. And nobody’s been tougher before the deal ever on China than Trump. Then I made a deal. I was very happy with the deal. It’s a great deal, great for our farmers. The farmers had been paid a fortune already. [crosstalk 01:24:55] Then what happened? No mistake, we made a great deal. Now I find out after the deal, after the deal, not during, after the deal, [crosstalk 01:25:02] I find out that I’m not happy [crosstalk 00:16:04]."
2020-04-19,01:25:05,Donald Trump,"You people are so pathetic at CNN. Let me just tell you. [crosstalk 01:25:08] Sure. I was very happy with the deal, very happy with everything. Then we find out about the plague, right, the plague, and since we found out about that, I’m not happy. But I closed it up long before [crosstalk 01:25:21] Pelosi, listen, long before Pelosi. You know, she was having parties in San Francisco. Let’s all go to Chinatown, and that was a long time after I closed up the country. [crosstalk 01:25:31] Go ahead please."
2020-04-19,01:25:34,Unnamed,The first of the month is next week-
2020-04-19,01:25:35,Donald Trump,That’s why your ratings are so bad because you’re pathetic. Go ahead. Let’s go. Your ratings are terrible. You got to get back to real news. Go ahead.
2020-04-19,01:25:42,Unnamed,"The first of the month is next week, so for people that are worried about whether or not they’re going to see a stimulus check again next month, will there be another stimulus check-"
2020-04-19,01:25:49,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re looking at it, we’re talking about it. The delivery has been very good, as you know. People are getting them and they’re happy. It’s saving lives. [crosstalk 01:25:56] We will let you know when it’s appropriate but we’re not going to let our people suffer. And you’ve seen that. By the way, you’ve seen that better than anyone and you people have actually covered it with you know, within, okay, but you’ve seen what’s going on, and we got those checks out to people. It saved their lives. Nobody else could’ve done it. Nobody else could have done it [crosstalk 01:26:18] and I’m very happy. If we get this new check out to the workers in these small, essentially to the workers of these small businesses to PPP, we’re going to be very happy because as we open, those businesses are going to open along with us. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-04-19,01:26:35,Unnamed,"Mr. President, as you start reopening the country, do you plan to coordinate with Mexico and Canada to ensure U.S. manufacturers have-"
2020-04-19,01:26:43,Donald Trump,"I could see that, too. We’re coordinating right now with both. I spoke with the President of Mexico yesterday. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Canada a lot, Justin, and we’re in very good coordination right now."
2020-04-19,01:26:55,Unnamed,"Just concerns, as the supply chain as companies here-"
2020-04-19,01:26:58,Donald Trump,"We’re doing the supply chain. It’s not going to affect trade. That’s part of trade and it’s not going to affect trade. And if it does, I will tell you, if a supply chain based in Mexico or Canada interrupts with our making a big product and an important product, or even a military product, we’re not going to be happy. Let me tell you that. Go ahead. One or two more. [crosstalk 01:27:22] Go ahead in the back. You didn’t go."
2020-04-19,01:27:23,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you very much."
2020-04-19,01:27:24,Donald Trump,Who are you with?
2020-04-19,01:27:25,Unnamed,I’m with the Salt Lake Tribune.
2020-04-19,01:27:26,Donald Trump,Okay.
2020-04-19,01:27:27,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. On Thursday, the White House announced a congressional task force for reopening America, and included every Republican senator but Mitt Romney. Does that show that you’re still holding a grudge against Mitt Romney?"
2020-04-19,01:27:36,Donald Trump,"Yeah, it does. You know, I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney. I had 52 Republican senators."
2020-04-19,01:27:43,Unnamed,He was a governor. You don’t want his-
2020-04-19,01:27:44,Donald Trump,"Well, I just don’t think, you know, I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney. I don’t really want his advice. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-19,01:27:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, why on that task force did you include Senator Kelly Locklear? There’s some questions about whether she-"
2020-04-19,01:27:55,Donald Trump,"Well, because she used to Senator from a great state, a state that I love, Georgia."
2020-04-19,01:28:02,Unnamed,But there’s some insider trading.
2020-04-19,01:28:02,Donald Trump,"Well, that I don’t know. I really don’t know about that, but she’s a senator from Georgia and she was included in the list. Absolutely. [crosstalk 01:28:09] All right, couple of more. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-19,01:28:11,Unnamed,"Mr. President, you said you’d spoken to [inaudible 01:28:14] of the progress being made in Germany. You spoke about-"
2020-04-19,01:28:16,Donald Trump,"Many of the leaders, yeah."
2020-04-19,01:28:17,Unnamed,Yeah. Many of the countries that maybe have taken their eye off the ball and let coronavirus let rip in their countries. Which ones were you talking about? The UK?
2020-04-19,01:28:28,Donald Trump,"You mean some of the ones that didn’t do well? I don’t say that, but you just have to look. And some of them just got hit hard. When I closed up our border, when I did the ban on China, they say a lot of the people that didn’t come in here went to Italy. You’ve heard that. That’s why Italy was hit so hard. I don’t think it was because of government. I will say Italy is locked down probably more than any other country right now. It’s just absolutely locked solid down. But they got hit very hard because people that were coming to the United States couldn’t come, because I closed the country in January, and they went to Italy. They say it had to do with trade. It had to do with the purchase of certain materials, and Italy was another alternative."
2020-04-19,01:29:09,Donald Trump,"And so many, many people went to Italy instead of coming here. And Italy has suffered greatly. Now, I spoke with the Prime Minister a lot. He’s a great friend of mine, and what’s happened to Italy is very, very tough. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. We’ll see you tomorrow. Thank you."
2020-04-20,01:12,Donald Trump,Thank you very much everyone. Thank you.
2020-04-20,01:29,Donald Trump,"Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence. We’re going to have a resurgence, too. At a time when millions of American workers and families are struggling with the financial consequences of the virus, it’s critical to continue the medical war while reopening the economy in a safe and responsible fashion."
2020-04-20,01:56,Donald Trump,"During this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined and that everybody’s become very familiar with. We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner."
2020-04-20,02:16,Donald Trump,"For example, recent deaths are down very, very substantially. You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30%, 25% in Detroit, as an example. It’s down by over 50%. Congratulations. And in New Orleans where they’ve done a terrific job, they’re down 65%. 30 states have just one case or less per 1000 people, far fewer cases per capita as an example than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden."
2020-04-20,02:57,Donald Trump,"My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful paycheck protection program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs. We hope to have an agreement very soon and hopefully tomorrow the Senate is going to be able to vote. A lot of progress has been made on that, tremendous progress. It’s a great plan. It’s a great plan. It’s helped a lot of people. So we hope to have a vote maybe tomorrow in the Senate."
2020-04-20,03:24,Donald Trump,"And based on the record low price of oil that you’ve been seeing, it’s at a level that’s very interesting to a lot of people. We’re filling up our national petroleum reserves, strategic, the strategic reserves, and we’re looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves. That would top it out. That would be the first time in a long time it’s been topped out. We’d get it for the right price."
2020-04-20,03:55,Donald Trump,"We’re also pushing for the deal to include an additional and visits, elective procedures, surgeries, etc, etc, were canceled. We think that they can all get back online and get it done. The hospitals have really been fantastic. The hospitals, they’ve stepped up to the plate. They’ve really done a great job. We appreciate it so much. For areas less affected by the virus, we’ve issued new recommendations about how to safely resume elective treatments. HHS has also distributed the first $30 billion in direct payments to a million healthcare providers across the country. We’ve also invested $1.4 billion in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African-American and Hispanic-American communities, have access to the services and testing that they need."
2020-04-20,04:50,Donald Trump,"Earlier today, vice president Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus. He had a great call. It was a great call, very positive in I’d say every way. Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states. Many, many labs. We’re providing you with the list. We’ll show it to you now if you need it. We’ll give you the details, but hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able. Some of the governors, like as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list. He didn’t understand too much about what was going on. So now I think he’ll be able to do that. It’s pretty simple, but they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out. We’ll work with them and work with all of the governors."
2020-04-20,05:46,Donald Trump,"Similar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity. Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand, and it is a complex subject, but some of the governors didn’t understand it. The governor, as an example Pritzker from Illinois, did not understand his capacity, not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support. I mean you have to take the support where you have it, but we are there to stand with the governors and to help the governors, and that’s what we’re doing and they have a tremendous capacity that we’ve already built up and you’ll be seeing that. We’re going to be introducing a couple of the folks in a little while to talk about it."
2020-04-20,06:31,Donald Trump,"I want to draw your attention to Governor Cuomos remarks during his press conference today. He said, “The President is right. The state’s testing is up. My job to coordinate those 300 labs. I think the President’s right when he says that the states should lead,” and the governors, they’re really getting… They’re getting it together in New York. A lot of good things are happening in New York, and I think the governor is going to come in to see us tomorrow. He’s coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon. Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people, so we look forward to that."
2020-04-20,07:07,Donald Trump,"Some of the articles that just recently came about, if you remember, and I put out a statement today, for a month it was all ventilator, ventilator, ventilator. It’s all people could talk about was ventilators, and we did a great job with that. We built a lot of ventilators, to put it mildly. We have so many now that at some point soon we’re going to be helping Mexico, and Italy, and other countries. We’ll be sending them the ventilators, which they desperately need. They were not in a position to build them themselves, but we have thousands being built. Every state has had… They have the ventilators. If they don’t, we have almost 10,000 in our federal reserve, our stock pile as they call it, and we did a great job with the ventilators."
2020-04-20,07:58,Donald Trump,"Unfortunately, the press doesn’t cover it other than the fair press, but so then you say, “Gee, they need ventilators. We don’t need ventilators.” And that’s under pressure we did that. Nobody that needed a ventilator in this country didn’t get one. And a story that just came out, How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story, I’m sure you’d love to see that. That’s by Rich Lowery, respected journalist and person. How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story, which unfortunately it did. And here’s another one that just came out. Kyle Smith, The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t. The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t because we got it fixed."
2020-04-20,08:44,Donald Trump,"And we’re also going to help the states, by the way, stockpile ventilators so if a thing like this should happen again they’ve got them. The stories on testing are all over the place that we’re actually in good shape. I’m going to have the vice president and others speak to you about that, but we’re in very good shape on testing and we’re getting better all the time. You’re going to see some interesting things."
2020-04-20,09:07,Donald Trump,"I thought before I went any further though, I’d like to have General Semonite, who’s done an incredible job, tell you where we are. We’re still building beds in hospitals for people that need them. I guess the hospital business general is getting pretty much closed out now, but we’re creating a lot of a space for people just in case, and in some cases they probably will be using them. But I thought the general, he’s been so impressive and done such a great job, I thought on behalf of the services and on behalf of the federal government he’d say a few words about what we’re doing right now. Thank you very. General?"
2020-04-20,09:48,General Semonite,"Well, thank you Mr. President. I just want you to know that on behalf of all of us in the Department of Defense, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those patients and all those victims that have been affected by this terrible virus. And the President and the Vice President talk all the time about the heroes, but when I’ve been out there I’ve seen the doctors, I’ve seen the nurses and all those that have worked very, very hard, and we’re just so proud to be part of this noble calling."
2020-04-20,10:09,General Semonite,"For my team, I really made it very, very simple. I said, “There’s three legs of this stool and they all have S’s.” There’s sites, in other words hospitals. We’ve got to worry about supplies, and we’ve got to worry about staff. And so right when Governor Cuomo called the President about almost 30 days ago and said, “I need some help,” worrying about what could be tens of thousands of hospital room shortages."
2020-04-20,10:32,General Semonite,"So the President and Secretary of Defense asked us to fly to Albany with a team. And on the way up we understood how complex of a challenge this was, and we knew there’s no way you can solve a complex catastrophe with a complicated solution. We needed a very, very simple solution to be able to then work with HHS, to be able to work with FEMA, to be able to work with the Vice President’s task force, and then to be able to power this down all the way down to the local level. Some of the governors asked us to try to build a hospital in a parking lot or a field in two or three weeks. You can’t physically do that. So what we said was let’s go to where there’s an existing facility, and I’m going to kind of make this in two big pots. Those that are either hotel rooms or college dormitories, smaller rooms, or those that are in real large areas like field houses or convention centers."
2020-04-20,11:21,General Semonite,"And we designed those standard facilities that could be either non-COVID or COVID, and then we got that approved here at the federal government to be able to then power that back down. So we went to Governor Cuomo and he said right up front, “I love the concept. I need you in the Javits Center. I’m ready to start having you work tomorrow afternoon.” So when we flew back that afternoon, the next day we basically built the standard design and then continued to be able to power it down all the way down through the rest of the team."
2020-04-20,11:48,General Semonite,"So I just want to show you a couple of slides here, and we’ll let know where we’re at right now, Mr. President. We had to do a bunch of assessments. So somewhere in the order of over 1100 different locations we went to, and we worked for FEMA, we worked for the President, and we worked for governors and mayors. And we said, “What do you think your demand is going to be?” And based on a lot of the modeling that’s been in this room here, we were able to understand when the peak curve was, but we also were able to understand where’s the bed shortage. So then these 1100 facilities right now today, so we’re actually executing 32 different facilities. That’s on the order of merit of about 16,000 beds. Eight of those are all done. We’ve still got a lot more to complete, and in the next week-and-a-half we’re going to complete about 15 more facilities. We’ve got some pending. Some mayors and governors are still wondering do they have enough bed space."
2020-04-20,12:43,General Semonite,"And what’s important here is we need a very agile plan. You can’t do something three weeks ago and think that this is going to continue to stay because this virus gets a vote. And this entire team, the federal government’s tried to be as agile as they can supporting those states and those governors. The beauty of the plan though is it doesn’t have to be built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. So we designed about an extra 52 facilities. We gave those to the governors and I’ve got to be very, very laudatory to the governors, they then imposed and put a lot of those on the ground and did those themselves."
2020-04-20,13:16,General Semonite,"So let’s go. I’m just going to show you some real simple pictures here. Go to the next slide if you don’t mind. So this is an example of the Javits Center, and you’ve heard the President talk about it quite a few times. This one about 2100 bed spaces. What you get is about a 11 or 12 foot square cubicle. There is lights in there, there’s a nurse call so if you need to be able to call the nurse station. There are nurse stations throughout. There’s pharmacies throughout. This one started as non-COVID but then we came back in and put in central oxygen so everybody has oxygen right behind their bed to be able to take care of those patients, and again, built this one about a thousand patients treated."
2020-04-20,13:56,General Semonite,"Let’s go to the next one. I was up in Detroit with Governor Whitmere and she walked us through and told us her intent. Here’s what she needed to do this in the TCF Center. You’ll see all the cubicles that are laid out. This is right in the middle of a convention floor where there might be like a boat show or a car show, and then went in and built 970 different capabilities there. And again, a lot of great work by my guys in the Corps of Engineers and the rest of the mayor’s and the city’s team all pulling together."
2020-04-20,14:23,General Semonite,"Let’s go to the next one. This is called the McCormick Place. Governor Pritzker sat us down. He said, “Here’s our intent or what you want to do.” Mayor Lightfoot walked us through and we went into another large convention center. This is actually 3000 bed spaces, a very, very large build, and got this one done in a relatively short time."
2020-04-20,14:41,General Semonite,"And then here’s another one that kind of helps you understand the dynamic here. Go to the next one please. This is in Miami Beach. And I flew in to see Governor DeSantis, and my guys had scoped out about 450 beds and he said, “Todd, how long is it going to take to build this?” And we said probably until the 27th of April. And he went to his health people and he said, “How long do you need?” And he said, “The day we need this is the 21st of April.” And I told my guys, “You don’t have until the 27th. Figure out how to get it done by the 20th.” This is where you don’t get to build to be able to have the perfect solution. You’ve got to be able to get the mission essential done. Lives are on the line here and we’ve got to be able to get everything done to be able to save those lives."
2020-04-20,15:22,General Semonite,"And let’s go to the last one here. This is one we’re doing right now, Colorado. This is in Denver and another gigantic convention center. You’ll see all the different cubicles here to be able to just bring in that oxygen, six-inch copper pipe that comes in and it’s all piped throughout the entire convention center, six miles of pipe that’s able to go in to be able to make that happen."
2020-04-20,15:42,General Semonite,"And in closing, I just want to be able to say that we are very, very focused in the Corps of Engineers getting this done. But this is all about the team, the federal team, the state team, the local team, the vice president’s task force, and a lot of the people sitting here, have informed us of how fast we need to go. And it goes back to again, all the governors and the mayors to make this happen."
2020-04-20,16:02,General Semonite,"But I want to reiterate, President Trump has called me three times, and Secretary Esper has been on the phone at least one of those times, and said, “What else do we need to do to set you up for success? Is there any other knobs we can turn to be able to help you build?” And you think about that equation of those three S’s. I think that with the federal government and the mayors in the cities here, we’ve effectively taken that first S out of the equation. And so I can’t tell you of all the things I’ve done in my career, this is a noble calling to be able to step up and save American lives. So with that, sir, I thank you very much."
2020-04-20,16:31,Donald Trump,"Fantastic, Jeff. Thank you very much. Anybody have a question for the General while he’s here? Anybody? Because I think it’s very self-explanatory. He’s done an incredible job. Jeff, do you have a question?"
2020-04-20,16:42,Unnamed,"I do. Are there more projects, sir, beyond the ones that you’ve just identified that you’ll be working on?"
2020-04-20,16:46,General Semonite,"So about a week ago we thought we were about capped at 26. What we’re seeing is, as I said, the virus gets a vote. We’re seeing some of these curves are stretching out where we might’ve thought we only had five or six days. We actually have a couple of weeks now. Other ones we’re seeing exactly the opposite. So where we didn’t think there was some, and I’m not going to go into locations here, but we are definitely get requested and we’ve got six more requesting just in the last four or five days. They’re a little bit smaller facilities in more remote areas, but our job, we still, if we have enough time to go build, we want to get in there, do the assessment. We work for the mayor, and the city, and the governor here, and we can still get them done if the mayors and those elected officials make a fast enough decision."
2020-04-20,17:24,Donald Trump,"You might say while you’re here, you’re building… The General’s in charge of the wall on the Southern border, and we want to build 450 miles of wall and it’s very much under construction. You might give them a little bit of an update. How are we doing with the wall?"
2020-04-20,17:37,General Semonite,"So, sir, I think the most important thing, and you stressed this and Secretary Esper stressed this, there’s really several different priorities here. Our number one priority in Department of Defense and the Corps of Engineers is to protect the team, protect the force. No matter what we do, we’ve got to continue to take care of our civilians and our service members out there, and so every single thing we’re doing, whether we’re building for the VA, or we’re building for civil works projects, or for the Department of Defense, or building on the Southwest border, we are going out of our way."
2020-04-20,18:03,General Semonite,"I talked to my commanders this morning, we’ve got over 4,000 contractors that are on the ground out there and we’ve had no positives as of this morning, knock on wood. Same thing with my 400 employees. We’re testing them. Not necessarily one of the more stringent tests, but with temperatures, to be able to make sure that everybody’s safe and everybody goes out of their way to do things the right way. Construction is going very, very smooth. What we’re seeing is our contractors are extremely focused. Now that we’ve got a good clear path both on the CBP program as well as some of the DOD program. We, I think, very well postured it’s a very, very aggressive build, but we’re well postured to be able to meet your expectations, sir, of 450 by the end of December 2020."
2020-04-20,18:44,Donald Trump,And we’re over 160 miles.
2020-04-20,18:47,General Semonite,"164 as of today, sir."
2020-04-20,18:48,Donald Trump,164 miles. And we’ll have it done sometime pretty early next year. Very exciting.
2020-04-20,18:55,General Semonite,"Yes, sir."
2020-04-20,18:56,Donald Trump,"And you might just say one thing, the quality of that wall in terms of its power for stopping people that shouldn’t be coming into our country."
2020-04-20,19:03,General Semonite,"So, same thing, if you have a standard design that you trust in and it works very well. I’ve got to pat on the back Commissioner Morgan. He was very adamant to continue to be able to make sure that it supports his agents. And so we’ve got a design now that certainly does that. And then we’ve got a phenomenal contractor workforce that’s in there, my Corp of Engineer employees and it’s going in well. We don’t see any significant problems. And I think it’s also important to point out that we want to do this the right way. So we try to balance this with environmental considerations that are out there. We’re trying to do due diligence when it comes to anything to do with any of the citizens that are affected. We’re trying to make sure that we’re protecting all of the things that we need to protect and try to find that balance where we can both meet the administration’s directive while at the same time making sure we’re doing this so that everybody gets a vote and everybody has a fair shake."
2020-04-20,19:56,Donald Trump,"Yeah, please."
2020-04-20,19:57,Unnamed,My I ask what you’re doing regarding the availability at the recreation sites that the Army Corps of Engineers operates? How the access is going there and whether or not there were restrictions?
2020-04-20,20:10,General Semonite,"So I’m an engineer. I take my guidance from some of these experts sitting on the bench over here, and when the President says, “Turn on America,” what we initially did, like many, many other governors, they shut down beaches, shut down cities. I had a meeting with my commanders this morning, and as soon as we think it’s safe, turn them back on. I mean parking out there at a rec area where you’re 500 feet away from everybody in a camper is probably low threat. I will continue to take guidance from the administration, but where we get green lights to continue to put our rec areas full up and let everybody go back out there and do things in the safest way. I mean, we work for the administration so I want to do it safe, but I don’t want to be the last guy that turns things on. Not at all. Yes ma’am."
2020-04-20,20:51,Unnamed,"Thanks for walking us through some of the efforts. Can you say anything about whether or not there are any specific efforts in communities that are hardest hit like black communities or Latino communities, communities of color? Are the Army Corps of Engineers doing anything that would be building any sort of temporary facilities for those communities?"
2020-04-20,21:06,General Semonite,"So, we basically key off what the city asked for, the city and the governor. There are a couple of specific areas that certain city mayors have asked us for. Again, I’m not going to go into details, but we basically, if they go in and say, “I’m very worried about a hotspot on this side of town or a specific community here,” we will do, and that’s what the administration is charged to do, is whatever we can do to be most responsive. We just don’t want ever to have an ambulance pull up to the back of a hospital and somebody says, “We’re out of room, go to the next hospital down.” So that’s where we’re trying to make sure that that bed space is available, and so far everything we built has been ahead of need. In other words, we’re able to finish the building two or three days before it’s needed. Thank you ma’am."
2020-04-20,21:46,Donald Trump,Okay. So you don’t really have a choice. You can stay and watch these wonderful people ask us really nice questions or you can go back to building beds.
2020-04-20,21:54,General Semonite,"Sir, I get a lot of building to do. I’m going to leave, if you don’t mind."
2020-04-20,21:56,Donald Trump,Go ahead [inaudible 00:00:21:56].
2020-04-20,21:57,General Semonite,"Thank you, sir."
2020-04-20,21:58,Donald Trump,"Very impressive. That’s an impressive job. Isn’t it? Seriously. That’s really great. Thank you very much. He’s a terrific gentleman. We have a lot of great people doing that kind of thing that they really have to get recognition for the incredible job they are doing because I don’t think anybody else could do it. Nothing like that. And that’s on top of thousands and thousands of hospitals, and he built just in New York alone, four hospitals and 2, 900 beds, and got them done so quickly. Nobody saw anything like it. Fortunately, we haven’t had to use too many of them and that’s okay. That’s probably better news than having to use them all. Right? Because a lot of good things are happening in New York and elsewhere."
2020-04-20,22:47,Donald Trump,"So through the public, private partnerships, and deregulation, the federal government has already made immense testing capabilities available, but some states need to take action to fully utilize it. To date, the United States has conducted millions more tests than any other country. You can add them all up and they don’t catch us. And our numbers are doubling almost on, certainly on a monthly basis, but almost on a weekly basis. We’re moving very rapidly, at a number nobody thought possible. And we’ll be doubling our number of daily tests if the governors bring their states fully online through the capability that they have. We have tremendous capability out there already existing and we explained that to the governor today. Mike and all of the people explained it very strongly to the governors. They really get it now I think."
2020-04-20,23:40,Donald Trump,"As the experts have explained, this capacity is sufficient to allow states to conduct diagnostic testing to treat patients, as well as contact tracing to contain outbreaks and monitoring to pinpoint potential hotspots during phase one. And there are some hotspots and we have them pinpointed, and they can really cover it very, very nicely when they know exactly where to go, and they’re being told where to go. And also these locations where they’re going, and some of them are federal, some of the governors didn’t realize they were allowed to use federal locations. They are. And we have a booklet of the federal locations. We can hold it up. I think you’ll show that. Maybe we’ll hold it up now. Yeah. Okay, fine. But you see the number of things. These are all locations where they can go, which is really pretty amazing. This is just one page out of many. Look at this. These are all locations. That’s a lot of locations. And they can all… What is it, 5,000?"
2020-04-20,24:50,Unnamed,"5,000 [inaudible 00:24:51]."
2020-04-20,24:52,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. That’s more than anybody thought, and it’s already there. They have to use it. That’s all, they have to use it. Some weren’t aware. Some were very much aware, some weren’t aware."
2020-04-20,25:03,Donald Trump,"My administration also continues to support states with our massive operation to deliver masks, gowns, gloves and other vital supplies. Admiral Policheck and his team at FIFA are really… What a job they’ve done. And Pete, what a job he’s done. They’re calling on Easter Sunday to make sure everyone’s okay. But they are using detailed data about supply chains to track the deployment of 1 billion pieces of protective equipment through private distributors every two weeks. So what we’re doing is we’re delivering a number that nobody anywhere in the world is delivering. FEMA is working closely with Dr. Berkson, the distributors, to prioritize supply of resources where they are most needed, where finding the [inaudible 00:25:52] that they have to. They have to get to that location. We have locations that are very important to get to, and get to them fast, and that’s where they’re going. So we have a very strong priority."
2020-04-20,26:03,Donald Trump,"… and that’s where they’re going, so we have a very strong priority. This pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of keeping vital supply chains at home. We cannot outsource our independence. We cannot be reliant on foreign nations. I’ve been saying this for a long time. If we’ve learned one thing, it’s let’s do it here. Let’s build it here. Let’s make it here. We’ve got the greatest country in the world. We got to start bringing our supply chains back."
2020-04-20,26:25,Donald Trump,"Somebody years ago got this crazy idea, let’s build all over the place and let’s have parts. Let’s have a screw for a car delivered and made in a country that’s far away and let’s have a fender made someplace else and let’s do this and let’s do that and let’s put it all together. I like making it right here in the USA. I think we’ve learned a lot about that and especially maybe when it comes to pharmaceutical products."
2020-04-20,26:52,Donald Trump,"We’ve also conducted major military operations providing cities and states with additional medical capacity and the incredible 1,800 men and women from the Army Corps of Engineers. You just met with Todd. The job they’ve done is incredible, but we have nurses, doctors, we have experts in every field, all over."
2020-04-20,27:16,Donald Trump,"Spoke with governor Cuomo, spoke with Mayor de Blasio, spoke with many of the other governors that I’m both friendly, and I think I’m friendly with just about all of them if you can believe it, but I’ve gotten friendly with a lot of them. I’ve gained a lot of respect for a lot of the governors, both Republican and Democrat during this process. Some really good people, some really good talent, but we’re sending a lot of our medical people, not only our construction people like Todd Semonite, but a lot of our medical people are being sent all over the country to different locations, New York City, New York State and New Jersey. I spoke with Phil today, he’s doing a terrific job in New Jersey, but New Jersey got hit very, very hard. Phil Murphy, governor."
2020-04-20,28:02,Donald Trump,"From the day this crisis began, America launched a scientific mobilization of colossal size and scale. Someday they’ll be able to write the true story because nobody’s seen anything like it. The fake news just refuses to cover it correctly, but that’s okay. The people are understanding and that’s what matters to me."
2020-04-20,28:24,Donald Trump,"There are now 72 active trials underway across the United States researching dozens of therapies and treatments and another 211 are in the planning stages. They’re getting, I mean, they’re literally mobilizing on therapeutics and also on vaccines. A tremendous progress is being made on vaccines and I must say on therapeutics. I mean, frankly, if I had my choice, give me the therapeutics right now because that would help people right now. We have some things that I think are working. Not only working, but we have some incredible things that look like they could be an answer, but we’ll know soon, being tested, working out right now."
2020-04-20,29:07,Donald Trump,"This includes therapies designed to attack the virus as well as others that would hinder its replication, reduce the rate of infection, control the immune response or transfer lifesaving antibodies from the blood of recovered patients. One of the incredible things that we’ve seen, and Mike and I were talking about it before, is the fact oftentimes somebody gets very ill from the plague, okay, from this horrible scourge and they get better and they recover. The first thing they say is, “I want to give my blood.” That’s happened. The doctors have told me it’s happened so much. “I want to give my blood, I want to give my blood,” and they’re doing that."
2020-04-20,29:49,Donald Trump,"But tremendous things are happening. You’ll be seeing that over the weeks. I think we’ll be talking about it in the not too distant future. Johnson & Johnson’s very well along on vaccines. Again, the vaccines have to be tested. The therapeutics are for now, but a lot of good things are happening on both. But ultimately we also hope to prevent infection through a safe, a very safe vaccine. That’ll be a great thing when we have that and we will have that."
2020-04-20,30:15,Donald Trump,"With that, I’d like to introduce Admiral Giroir and Brad Smith to discuss some of the incredible things that have been done and we have, they really are. What they’ve been able to do at a very, very short period of time. Equipment, you’re going to see equipment that you haven’t seen before and if you’d just come up Brad, if you guys would come up, you could give us a little display of some of the equipment that we have and some of the things that are happening having to do with testing because testing is a big word."
2020-04-20,30:47,Donald Trump,"Remember, it was all ventilators and the reason it was all ventilators they said, “There’s no way he’ll ever be able to catch this one,” and not only did we catch it, we are now the King of Ventilators all over the world. We can send them anywhere. We have thousands being made a week and they’re very high quality and that’s wasn’t playing well."
2020-04-20,31:08,Donald Trump,"Then they said testing, testing, “Oh, we’ll get him on testing.” Well, testing is much easier than ventilator. Ventilators are big machines that are very complex, that are very expensive. You need a group of people that really know what they’re doing. We took auto lines, we took a lot of different people and now we’ve done that. But it used to be ventilators, ventilators, ventilators. Now it’s testing, testing, testing."
2020-04-20,31:33,Donald Trump,"I think the Admiral and I think that Brad will show you some things that you haven’t seen that are really a very spectacular having to do with testing. We’re way advanced, way advanced. The list I showed you, these are places you can go if you’re in the states, 5,000 different machines. 5,000, they’re all over the country and we have international also. But these are all over the country. But you’ll see something now that’s really eye-popping in terms of what they’ve done and they’ve done this under great pressure. They’ve come up with things under great pressure that are absolutely amazing."
2020-04-20,32:13,Donald Trump,"Please, if you would. Thank you, folks."
2020-04-20,32:19,Brett Giroir,"Well, thank you, Mr. President. Want to talk about a couple things today a little bit different than I’ve spoken about before. Since early March, we’ve really been focusing on two key concepts for testing. Number one, to assure and expand supplies in the U.S. market. This is really critical because we were talking about really a cottage industry with very minimal suppliers that we were asking to supply over a two-week period of time the normal production that would be for at least a year. As simple as a swab is, a swab is not a swab is not a swab, and we need to be very careful that when we put something in a person and tell them a test result that it’s really correct."
2020-04-20,33:01,Brett Giroir,The second component is to secure sufficient supplies at FEMA during this time of peak disease where we could alleviate any maldistributions within the state. This is the theme of process of requesting and sending things out and also supporting outbreaks.
2020-04-20,33:16,Brett Giroir,"So, starting many weeks ago, starting in my office many weeks ago, we assembled a multidisciplinary team of really incredible people. The medical side of the equation, which I represent, the laboratory side of the equation, high-tech side of the equation, logistics and operation and Brad Smith, his day job is Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an incredibly important component of our country’s CMS system, building the future healthcare system, but has done a really incredible job operationally and logistically in bringing everyone together."
2020-04-20,33:52,Brett Giroir,"We have focused on every piece of the supply chain that relates to testing down to the most minute detail and he’s going to talk to you about some of that, but that started in the second week of March with starting an air lift because the only supplier, the main supplier of swabs at that time was a place in Italy that was completely shut off because of the outbreak in Italy. So, Admiral Polowczyk arranged gray tail Air Force planes to go to Italy to bring millions of swabs back to secure. That’s just how it started and it’s expanded since then."
2020-04-20,34:22,Brett Giroir,"The second part is we’ve been really marrying, and this has been the beauty, the logistics and supplies to the overall strategy, two pieces of strategy. Number one, what is the overall testing strategy? Dr. Birx has had just an elegant strategy in the past, but even more important in the future when we make sure we take care of indigent populations and those most vulnerable. So the clinical, the contact tracing and the monitoring of those who are at most risk."
2020-04-20,34:51,Brett Giroir,"We’ve also married it to the strategy and you’ve heard more than you wanted to know about it, that a small machine that’s point-of-care is good for certain things, but it’s not going to test 5,000 people over a short period of time. So, the small machines, the medium machines and the large machines and how to contextualize them."
2020-04-20,35:08,Brett Giroir,"The third thing, before I give it to Brad, which is very important and it’s really critical, is coordinating the research, the epidemiology and the FDA regulatory process. Why is that so important? When we started five weeks ago, if we wanted to test this many people with the technology we had, we would have used about 80% of the strategic national stockpile in PPE just to do testing."
2020-04-20,35:32,Brett Giroir,"We needed an innovation. That innovation was to be able to test out of the anterior nose with a completely different kind of swab. It sounds very mundane, but if you don’t do that, you can’t get the testing to scale. That allowed us to really go to widespread testing."
2020-04-20,35:46,Brett Giroir,"Last week, moving to polyester swabs, which is going to open up millions of new swabs onto the market, but that’s a regulatory science and innovation step that had to co-occur with this and with that, I’m going to let Brad talk about some of the details that he has really shepherded over the past weeks in ways that have truly been amazing and incredibly impressive to me."
2020-04-20,36:09,Brad Smith,"Well, thank you, Mr. President. It’s an honor of a lifetime to be here and serving in this way. I’ve been working under Dr. Birx’s and Admiral Giroir’s leadership over the past several weeks to help increase the supply of testing across the United States."
2020-04-20,36:22,Brad Smith,"As you all know, there’s really three parts that you need to make the test work. First, you need the machine, which has Dr. Birx will share more and the president spoke to. We have a very, very large number of those across the United States. It’s about making sure that we’re taking advantage of them. The second part of the testing is making sure that we have the collection supplies to actually be able to collect the specimen and I’ll talk a little bit more about that. Then the third part is making sure that you have the materials you need to support the machine to ensure that you can actually process the test once it gets to the lab."
2020-04-20,36:54,Brad Smith,"I’ll let Dr. Birx talk more about the machines here in a second, but as you’ll see across the United States, we have a tremendous number. They range in variety, so we have some very small machines that do point-of-care testing. They may do, say, 50 to a 100 tests a day. We also have other very large machines. They can do several thousand, process several thousand tests a day."
2020-04-20,37:15,Brad Smith,"On the collection supply piece, I’ll talk through a couple of different kinds of collection that that can be done. For the nucleic acid test, which are the tests that are currently being done today, you generally need a swab of the nose. To do that, you need the swab, you need the collection tube and you also need the transport media that it can be transported in. We have a large, very large number of swabs already in the country, but we have secured an additional 30 million in production that we’ll be ramping up over the next several weeks."
2020-04-20,37:46,Brad Smith,"One company, located in the Northeast, we’re going to be using Title III of the DPA to help them build four new production lines. They are currently the largest swab producer in the country and this will help them ramp up their production tremendously to over 20 million additional swabs a month. A second company located in Ohio is currently the largest Q-tip maker in the country. We’re helping them convert their line from making Q-tips into making swabs. They are actually ramping up production starting this week of swabs and we’ll be ramping up to over 10 million per month. In total, that’s over 30 million new swabs that will be coming just over the next handful of weeks."
2020-04-20,38:25,Brad Smith,"The second piece is on the collection tubes. The collection tubes, we’ve been partnering with Oak Ridge National Lab, a Department of Energy lab based in Tennessee. They have very unique and sophisticated injection molding manufacturing capability and they are in the process of ramping that up to create collection tubes and they will be ramping up to over 40 million collection tubes a month here over the next several weeks."
2020-04-20,38:50,Brad Smith,"In addition to the swabs, we believe that as testing progresses there’ll be other types of testing like serological testing that will occur and those samples have to be collected in different ways. Many times some of those tests will require a finger prick. So in addition, we secured over 17 million lancets, which is what you use for the finger prick, so that we have those available as well as 17 million alcohol swabs, which is what you need to clean the finger before you do the finger prick."
2020-04-20,39:17,Brad Smith,"In addition, although folks are not talking about this much yet, we also believe that businesses across the country may want thermometers to test folks as they come into the office, and so we’ve secured over 650,000 infrared thermometers that states and businesses will be able to access to be able to test folks as they come into work. I think we’ve made tremendous progress on the collection side."
2020-04-20,39:39,Brad Smith,"In addition to the collection side, we’ve been very focused on ensuring that the labs have what they need. To process a specimen in a lab, you really need two things. You need something called an extraction kit and you needs something called a PCR test. In order to be able to fully process a test, you need both of these things. Sometimes these things come together and sometimes they come separate. For some of our point-of-care tests, including the Abbott and [Sefia 00:40:05] tests, they come together. They are ramping up production rapidly to over 3 million of those tests per month and these are tests that did not exist even a month ago."
2020-04-20,40:15,Brad Smith,"The second piece is on some of these large machines. They also sell complex cartridges that come together. One of the big manufacturers that has already ramped up production from about 1.6 million a month to more than twice that already and that’s already occurred. In addition to when they come together, they also sometimes come separate and we see significant ramping up of production there from our manufacturers through our public private partnerships. We’re seeing both several million more over the next few weeks of both the RNA extraction kit as well as the PCR test kit. So with that, thank you."
2020-04-20,40:49,Donald Trump,"Mike, please. Thank you, Brian."
2020-04-20,40:53,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President and I share your admiration for this remarkable team from the Army Corps of Engineers, to Brad, to Admiral Giroir. They’re doing a remarkable job every day."
2020-04-20,41:07,Mike Pence,"As the President mentioned today, we had our weekly conference call with governors across the country, states and territories and I was able to convey to them our appreciation for the leadership that every governor of every state and territory has provided. Thanks to their leadership, thanks to the extraordinary cooperation of the American people, despite the fact that more than 770,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus and our hearts grieve for the more than 41,000 Americans who’ve lost their life, the truth is that as we stand here today, we are slowing the spread and as the president reflected, we continue to see steady progress in less cases, lower hospitalizations, even in hotspots around the country. We commended America’s governors for their efforts in that regard. We are preserving our health care capacity as the general with the Army Corps of Engineers reflected. With the President’s direction, we’ve built a great number of hospitals around the country, but the utilization rate has been fairly low because of the mitigation efforts, the cooperation of the American people, we have not had to use them. That, as the president said, is very good news."
2020-04-20,42:25,Mike Pence,"In a word, we thank governors across the country for taking actions, decisive action to save lives and to make a difference. I reminded them that we’re all in this together and we have one mission, we’re one team. We spoke on the conference call about last week’s guidelines to open up America again and we heard from governors across the country about the progress that they’re making. We spoke to governors from New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Michigan about their ongoing efforts at social distancing and address questions that they had about needs that had been spoken up already in this presentation today."
2020-04-20,43:05,Mike Pence,"In addition, as we promised last week when we spoke to governors on Thursday about the guidelines to open up America, our team presented every governor in the country, states and territories, with a memorandum detailing laboratory capacity in all locations of laboratory equipment for diagnostic tests that can perform the coronavirus test. We also provided, as Dr. Birx will elaborate in just a few moments, literally a map about where these testing devices are located."
2020-04-20,43:41,Mike Pence,"I must tell you, Mr. President, I was very impressed at the way governors, as we speak, are scaling testing in their own states using these resources. Our hope is that by providing this information and by our team that we’ve enlisted out of Walter Reed, it’s contacting every one of the laboratories in the country to find out what their needs are and to encourage them to activate those testing machines to do coronavirus testing that will continue to be able to support a state-managed effort to increase testing even more."
2020-04-20,44:12,Mike Pence,"But a few highlights. Governor Doug Ducey announced antibody testing for 250,000 health professionals this week and first responders, a partnership between the state and the University of Arizona. We spoke today about Governor Gavin Newsom’s announcement that he set up a task force for testing, five to seven high-capacity testing hubs in partnership with the UC San Diego and UC Davis to increase testing in high capacity labs around the state of California."
2020-04-20,44:43,Mike Pence,"We heard from governor Ron DeSantis, Mr. President, about the efforts of the state of Florida. I believe he said that at this time Florida had conducted 275,000 coronavirus tests and they’re in the process of a major expansion of statewide testing with the goal of opening up additional sites and using the Florida National Guard to test residents at nursing homes and long-term care facilities in Florida."
2020-04-20,45:09,Mike Pence,"We also recommended today to every governor’s attention, the public health website that the State of Florida established, which has useful information on a county-by-county level about where testing is happening. Mr. President, as you said, governors are utilizing testing assets. They’re managing and deploying these resources as they see fit. At your direction, we’re going to continue to work very closely with them."
2020-04-20,45:33,Mike Pence,"Other governors that we spoke with included governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. There are 13 new or expanded coronavirus drive-through testing sites in Michigan that her team has stood up with Michigan Primary Care Association and we assured her that we would continue to work, as Brad and Admiral Giroir are literally working around the clock, to make sure that they have the supplies to support all of that testing. As the President said, Governor Hogan, who always begins our conference calls as he’s Chairman of the National Governors Association, expressed appreciation for last week’s guidelines to open America up again and his appreciation on behalf of all the governors for the list of laboratories in each individual state. He did raise the issue that we had included on the list Department of Defense facilities that have laboratories and machines and also other federal facilities, many of which are in Maryland. I was able to assure Governor Hogan, and every governor on the call, that we will make all of those laboratories available across the country to every state as the need for testing capacity continues to scale."
2020-04-20,46:47,Mike Pence,"This is one more step where you see the Army Corps of Engineer, where you literally see thousands of military doctors and nurses on the streets in New York and other cities around the country, this is one more step where we’re literally, as the President said from early on, are leaving no stone unturned and we are delivering a whole-of-government approach for our States as they, as they deal with the coronavirus outbreak."
2020-04-20,47:12,Mike Pence,"Governors are continuing to expand testing and we assured them that we’re going to continue to work in every way to support their efforts to do just that. I will say again as we’ve said before, as Dr. Birx comes up to explain to you what we deliver to the governors today, we told the governors once again today that by our best estimates we have enough testing capacity today for every state in America to go to Phase I, if they meet the other criteria of 14 days of reduced cases and sufficient hospital capacity to prepare for any eventuality that may occur."
2020-04-20,47:52,Mike Pence,"Once again, we have enough testing capacity for every state in America to go to Phase I, but we assured the governors today that we’re going to continue to work around the clock to expand the testing capacity, support supplies and to support their efforts to encourage social distancing and the very mitigation efforts that the American people have been doing that have brought us the progress that we see all across the country today."
2020-04-20,48:17,Mike Pence,"With that Mr. President, I’ll just let Dr. Burks describe what we distributed today."
2020-04-20,48:23,Donald Trump,"Thank you, Mike. Debra."
2020-04-20,48:24,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. Vice president, Mr. President. We just want to show you a couple of additional slides but also to remind all of Americans that we still have a significant number of cases, both in the Boston area and across Massachusetts and Chicago, to really that our hearts go out to those cities as they continue to struggle with coronavirus and the consequences at the hospitalization, to all the healthcare providers that are on the front lines."
2020-04-20,48:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"These are just an illustration of the different types of equipment that are out there. Describing them both as low-speed, but quick turnaround time, to high-speed and taking three to four hours to actually run 100 or more tests. The equipment ranged from all those different … That’s why there’s 5,000 of them as noted by the President in this list."
2020-04-20,49:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We wanted every governor and every state and health laboratory director to have a clear understanding of the full capacity within the state, both for the capacity but also where technical assistance and additional supplies may be available. We were proud to put the federal labs on that list because the military and the VA have stepped up every step of the way to provide support, both in testing and care. We have many military members on the front lines and I’m sure the military would offer their facilities to the Governor of Maryland or any governor who wanted to utilize those to expand testing."
2020-04-20,49:51,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The next slide, I’m just going to run through them very quickly. Every governor not only received the Excel spreadsheet with the complete list of the equipment and the zip code of the location and the laboratory to really be able to create a mosaic of laboratories of the high-speed and low-speed equipment together to meet the needs of their clients depending if their drive-through or hospital needs."
2020-04-20,50:17,Dr. Deborah Birx,"This is what Florida looks like, next slide. This is what Louisiana looks like, next slide. Maryland with significant capacity, next slide. Virginia with significant capacity throughout the state, next slide. New York, obviously a lot of capacity in New York City with overlapping capacity. It’s important to know where this is because then hospitals and labs can support each other when they need surge capacity, next slide. This is New Jersey, next slide. Pennsylvania, next slide. Massachusetts, next slide. Ohio, next slide. Oklahoma, next slide. Washington, next slide. I think that’s Wyoming. We wanted to show both in states that have large populations and in States that have lower populations, you can see that in general, the number of machines match their population, and we’re working with the Walter Reed group and the American Society of Microbiologists and all the lab directors to really create a web of understanding of what the capacity is currently, what the capacity can be, and how the federal government can support them in developing their strategies linked to the overarching federal strategy of testing as outlined in our guidelines."
2020-04-20,51:36,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-20,51:38,Unnamed (Reporter),Question for Dr. Birx [crosstalk 00:51:39].
2020-04-20,51:39,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-04-20,51:39,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Birx, University of Southern California and the L.A. County Public Health put out a report today that suggests that the penetrance of the virus is as much as almost 40 times as what it was believed to be. That as many as 442,000 people in L.A. County may have been affected, which suggests two things. It suggests that you have a lot more people out there who could be spreading the virus, but it also suggests that the case-"
2020-04-20,52:03,Unnamed,"… out there who could be spreading the virus. But it also suggests, that the case fatality rate is more in line with the 2017/2018 flu than what we’ve seen in some other areas of the world. But I’m wondering if you’ve seen that, what your thoughts were."
2020-04-20,52:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So we’re looking at all those studies very carefully. And I think you will remember over the last three weeks I’ve been talking about the level of asymptomatic spread and my concern about asymptomatic spread. Because, with flu and other diseases when people are sick, it’s easy to contact trace. When people are not sick and shedding virus, you have to have a very different approach, a very different sentinel surveillance approach, a sentinel monitoring approach, which we outlined in the guidelines. And it’s why the guidelines took that very seriously. We knew that was unique for respiratory diseases, but it was because we were very concerned about the level of asymptomatic. And if you remember, we used to… We talked about younger age groups may have more asymptomatic disease and your asymptomatic disease may decrease with your older age groups, and that your symptomatic disease might increase with age groups. This is still our working hypothesis, we have no data right now still to support that."
2020-04-20,53:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But it’s these kinds of studies that help that. We know that New York and Detroit and other cities are very interested, which we want to also support them, in testing frontline responders, first responders and healthcare workers, because we think their exposure may have been the greatest. What we don’t want to do… And I’m just going to do another 30 seconds on testing. These tests are not 100% sensitive or specific. And I’m going to go over this over and over again. So if you have 1% of your population infected and you have a test that’s only 99% specific, that means that when you find a positive, 50% of the time will be a real positive and 50% of the time it won’t be."
2020-04-20,53:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And that’s why we’re really asking people to start testing in among the first responders and the healthcare workers that may have had the greatest exposure, because that’s where the test will be most reliable. And then, when we have the luxury, we can go out to broader and broader communities. But this has been the fundamental question to begin with, and has been persistent. And we will emphasize to the American people again, this is a highly contagious virus. And we don’t know by looking at someone whether they have preexisting conditions or not. And so, all of us as far as protecting others must continue to do all of the recommendations to ensure that when we are in an asymptomatic state, we’re not passing the virus to others."
2020-04-20,54:43,Unnamed,"I have a question for you as well, the governor of South Carolina announced today, they’re going to open some stores with restrictions, but they just told my colleague [Natasha Chin 00:02:50] that they have not achieved that criteria in The White House guidelines about the downward trajectory for 14 days. So, shouldn’t they not be reopening stores today?"
2020-04-20,55:00,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We have asked every governor to follow the guidelines just as we’ve asked every American to follow the guidelines put out by the president. But, each of the governors can decide for themselves whether they’ve reached specific guidelines in specific areas. I had a question, I think on Saturday, about Jacksonville and their beaches. So, I did spend about five hours going to every state website, and I will tell you, that the Florida’s Department of Health Website is extraordinary, and this is what every department of health should have. Because when you go to that website, you can see that most of the cases are in Southern Florida, in the Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Broward County area. And if you look in Jacksonville, they had less than 20 cases per day, and less than 800 in four weeks. And so, these are the kinds of… When you inform the public and give them the information that they need, then they can make decisions along with the local government and governors. So, I’m not going to say specifically with South Carolina because I don’t know their specific website right now and I don’t talk about data unless I’ve seen it myself, but I know from Jacksonville that they had less than 20 cases a day. And so, this is how we need to start informing the community. These websites are critical. It’s by zip code and it’s by county, they can see cases, they can see cumulative cases, they can see new cases, they can see hospitalizations, they can see mortality, they can see age groups of mortality, and they can see where every testing piece is. This is how we have to inform the American public, and this is where the American public will develop confidence in each of their counties and local governments"
2020-04-20,56:38,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:56:38] the vice president mentioned that there’s enough testing capacity right now to proceed to phase one. But what about phase two or phase three, is there… Are there enough machines or enough cartridges? Are there enough reagents right now for the sort of reopening of the administration’s envisioning taking place over the next month or two?"
2020-04-20,56:53,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So you can see the current machine outline and you can see that both of these gentlemen have prepared to have everything ready for phase two and preparing it now for what we will need in the future. And I think that’s what you saw with the ventilators, that’s what you’re seeing with PPE. It’s not just for today, it’s for tomorrow. And it’s our federal planning, is not just for this instant. It’s making sure that we meet the needs of this instance, but we’re planning for 30 and 60 and 90 days ahead."
2020-04-20,57:24,Donald Trump,"Admiral, go ahead [inaudible 00:57:23]."
2020-04-20,57:25,Brett Giroir,"I would just agree with Dr. Birx completely. We are ready right now to enter phase one and we are ramping up all our capabilities across the board, not just to achieve what’s necessary for phase two but 2X, 3X, 4X, so that we will be absolutely over prepared when the nation is ready to go into those phases."
2020-04-20,57:48,Unnamed,President Trump.
2020-04-20,57:48,Donald Trump,"And by the way, not everybody agrees that we have to do that much testing. We’re going maximum, you understand? There’s some people who don’t want to do that much testing, but we’re going maximum, we’re going to the outer limits. And I think that’s the way probably it should be. Jeff, go ahead."
2020-04-20,58:01,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, to return to a topic that you opened the press conference with, on oil. US crude futures today went below zero, went into negative territory."
2020-04-20,58:11,Donald Trump,Went negative.
2020-04-20,58:11,Jeff (Reporter),Yeah.
2020-04-20,58:12,Donald Trump,"Like interest rates, they go negative."
2020-04-20,58:14,Jeff (Reporter),Does that make you want to see Saudi Arabia and Russia and OPEC-plus do more to reduce supply?
2020-04-20,58:20,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s for short-term. Much of it has do with short sellers. Much of it has to do… If you look a month into the future, I think it’s at 25 or $28 a barrel, so a lot of people got caught. They got caught and there are a lot of people that are not too happy because they got caught. So, if you take a look at it, you’ll see it’s more of a financial thing than an oil situation. But… Because you take… I believe in a month or so, in other words go a little bit out, it’s at 25 and $28 a barrel. So it’s largely a financial squeeze. And they did get squeezed."
2020-04-20,58:53,Jeff (Reporter),"So, would you like to see, however, Saudi Arabia and other countries make more cuts?"
2020-04-20,58:58,Donald Trump,"We’ve already done that. Where, Saudi Arabia is cutting back, Russia is cutting back, Mexico is cutting back and the OPEC-plus, they call it OPEC plus additional states, are cutting back. And the problem is, nobody is driving the car anywhere in the world, essentially, 184 nations, factories are closed and businesses are closed. And so, all of a sudden we had really a lot of energy to start off with, oil in particular, we had a lot. And then all of a sudden, they lost 40/50% of their market, so it just stops. So, it’s going to be picking up and the energy business will be strong. But they cut back… It could be 20 million barrels, but it’s let’s say 15, and that was between Russia and Saudi Arabia. But this had to do with the squeeze and it was a very tough squeeze. So, a lot of people got-"
2020-04-20,59:46,Jeff (Reporter),You don’t think they [inaudible 00:59:47] more right now.
2020-04-20,59:48,Donald Trump,"Well, they got to do more by the market, to be honest. Look, same thing over here. If the market is the way it is, people are going to slow it down or they going to stop. That’s going to be automatic, and that’s happening."
2020-04-20,59:59,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, on criminal justice reform and these SBA loans, I got an email earlier this morning from a fella in the Northwest who owns a supply business. And he has a felony on his record, nonviolent felony, in the past five years. Which under SBA guidelines make him ineligible for one of these PPP loans, so he has now had to let go 50 employees, many of whom are criminals trying to get back into society. I don’t believe there’s anything in the CARES Act that would restrict-"
2020-04-20,01:00:29,Donald Trump,"If you give me the name of the company and his name, I’ll have that checked out, John. I’ll do that. It’s a friend of yours?"
2020-04-20,01:00:37,John (Reporter),"No, not a friend of mine. No. Just somebody who contacted me [crosstalk 01:00:39] blue."
2020-04-20,01:00:38,Donald Trump,Why did he call you? He called you to say he’s a criminal and why did he get along or what’s…
2020-04-20,01:00:42,John (Reporter),"Because he wanted to apply for an SBA loan and couldn’t, and wondered how that squared with your-"
2020-04-20,01:00:47,Donald Trump,"Okay. If you give me the name, I’ll look into it. I’d like to look into that."
2020-04-20,01:00:51,Caitlin,I have a [crosstalk 01:00:52] country.
2020-04-20,01:00:51,Donald Trump,"Caitlin, go ahead."
2020-04-20,01:00:53,Caitlin,"If these companies that open and they have employees come back to work and they get sick, will these companies be liable?"
2020-04-20,01:00:58,Donald Trump,"Which companies, you’re talking about? Under what?"
2020-04-20,01:01:01,Caitlin,"Any companies that are manufacturing, any kind of company that [crosstalk 01:01:06] sick."
2020-04-20,01:01:06,Donald Trump,"So, we have… I’ll give you an answer to that. I’ll give you a legal answer to that when we look it up, but we’re trying to take liability away from these companies. We just don’t want that. Because we want the companies to open and open strong, but I’ll get you a legal opinion on that."
2020-04-20,01:01:18,Caitlin,[crosstalk 01:01:17].
2020-04-20,01:01:18,Donald Trump,"I’ll get you… Well, that’s what I’m saying. I’ll get you a legal opinion on that."
2020-04-20,01:01:22,Caitlin,You guys haven’t discussed that yet?
2020-04-20,01:01:22,Donald Trump,"Nobody has discussed it, no. But we will, now."
2020-04-20,01:01:25,Caitlin,Have any business executives voiced concern to you about being liable potentially?
2020-04-20,01:01:29,Donald Trump,Not one.
2020-04-20,01:01:29,Caitlin,They didn’t [crosstalk 01:01:30] last week.
2020-04-20,01:01:30,Donald Trump,"Not at this point. But we’re going to look, because they have talked about general liability, so I’ll get you a specific answer from the lawyers. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-20,01:01:38,Unnamed,"Thanks. [inaudible 01:01:38] to follow on oil. When you were talking earlier, you were talking about the PPP deal and then you mentioned the SPR and the first stimulus package even though you had announced that the-"
2020-04-20,01:01:53,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:01:52], but you know the price of oil right now, don’t you?"
2020-04-20,01:01:55,Unnamed,I do. Do you know the price of oil…
2020-04-20,01:01:58,Donald Trump,I do. I actually do.
2020-04-20,01:01:58,Unnamed,It’s negative $37.
2020-04-20,01:02:00,Donald Trump,"Of course, nobody has ever heard of negative oil before, but it’s for short-term."
2020-04-20,01:02:05,Unnamed,"In your opening remarks, you were talking about the PPP deal and then you mentioned the 75 million barrels of oil that you previously had said you wanted to purchase."
2020-04-20,01:02:15,Donald Trump,Yes.
2020-04-20,01:02:15,Unnamed,"You weren’t able to get funding for that in the first deal. So I’m wondering, are you-"
2020-04-20,01:02:19,Donald Trump,"Well, at the price you’re talking about, you don’t need funding. They pay you, see."
2020-04-20,01:02:22,Unnamed,"You can, if you can go get it in the next 24 hours."
2020-04-20,01:02:22,Donald Trump,"Because, right now… Well, if you can get it, that’s true. If you can get it."
2020-04-20,01:02:26,Unnamed,"So, my question… My first question is, are you asking for that funding as part of the [crosstalk 01:02:33]."
2020-04-20,01:02:32,Donald Trump,"Well, at a minimum, we’ll let people store. So, we’ll store it. We’ll use it as storage and charge for it. But people need storage desperately, and we have massive storage under the petroleum."
2020-04-20,01:02:43,Unnamed,So you’re not going to make it a requirement of the PPP/NRM funding deal [crosstalk 01:02:47]?
2020-04-20,01:02:47,Donald Trump,"It’s not a question of requirement. If we could buy it for nothing, we’re going to take everything we can get. The only thing I like better than that is where they pay you to take the oil, but that’s a short term squeeze. You understand that. So, it’s… I don’t think you’re going to see that. But no, we’d like to have Congress… This is a great time to buy oil. And we’d like to have Congress approve it so that we could instead of just storing it for the big, usually the big companies… Because, I think we have 75 million gallons right now, capacity. That’s a lot. It’s… We’ve been building it up over a period of time, but that’s a lot. 75 billion barrels. So we’re going to get… Either ask for permission to buy it or we’ll store it. One way or the other, it will be full. Please."
2020-04-20,01:03:30,Unnamed,"Mr. President, [crosstalk 01:03:32]."
2020-04-20,01:03:31,Donald Trump,"Go ahead. [crosstalk 00:11:33], finish up. We’ll go right to you."
2020-04-20,01:03:36,Unnamed,"Some senators, including Senator Cramer, have called on you to stop Saudi oil shipments that are on the way right now. Is that… You can do that under Section 232, is that something that you would consider-"
2020-04-20,01:03:45,Donald Trump,"Well, we’ll look at it. I heard, just as I’m walking into the room, we certainly have plenty of oil. So I’ll take a look at that. Yes, please."
2020-04-20,01:03:55,Unnamed,"Two questions. First on testing, the second on the SBA loan program. When will you or will you in fact invoke the DPA to force that company you mentioned, to ramp up production [crosstalk 00:12:05]?"
2020-04-20,01:04:05,Donald Trump,"Well, we don’t… We really don’t need it. We use it, we go up… And I’ve used it a lot. But we use it and then sometimes all they have to do is see it coming. Do you want to talk about that admiral, please?"
2020-04-20,01:04:17,Brett Giroir,"I think this is… I don’t think any of us knew very much about the DPA. But they’re sort of a foresight of the DPA where you force a company to do something, but there’s a second side of it which is really a hand up. The company we’re talking about, have done… Has done everything to support this effort. And they’ve ramped up production, I’m on the phone with them multiple times a day. This is the hand up. This is the government coming in and saying, “How can we help you expand your lines?” There’s no asynchrony here at all. So this is the hand up side of the DPA, which is exactly what these small American heroic companies need. They don’t need to be forced. They’re all in. Their employees are all in."
2020-04-20,01:04:58,Unnamed,"So, a point of clarity-"
2020-04-20,01:04:58,Donald Trump,"And we don’t want to embarrass people either. Please Brad, go ahead."
2020-04-20,01:05:02,Brad Smith,"So today we were on site…Or that we had folks on site with that company, finishing out what their capital projections will be in order to be able to ramp up these additional four lines that I spoke about. That company will then turn in a white paper to the DOD that will then help move the process forward, but it’s actively in process."
2020-04-20,01:05:20,Unnamed,"And I fully understand that the need is enormous. But on March 24th… March 21st, the administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. So far, roughly 4 million people have been tested. So, where are the other 23 million or so tests? Did they not materialize? Are they in the pipeline? Help us understand that discrepancy."
2020-04-20,01:05:39,Brett Giroir,"So, since I was the one who said that, let me explain where we were. So, I was getting my information, was correct information, about the actual tests that are in the marketplace. So, if you want to use those metrics, there’s been over ’40 million’ in the marketplace. But we have an end to end issue that we needed to deal with. And that’s what we’ve been dealing with, the swabs, the transport media… If we don’t have people utilizing the machines, the way Dr. Birx is talking about, we have some of our main platforms that are only 10% being utilized. You could have a lot of tests in the market and those are correct numbers, but if the machines aren’t utilizing them and they’re not organized at that level, then they’re not being utilized to its fullest. And that-"
2020-04-20,01:06:25,Donald Trump,"So that way you meant, if the machines were utilized, that would be-"
2020-04-20,01:06:28,Brett Giroir,You would have a lot of those millions of tests already being done. I think Ambassador Birx has estimated that we have another million tests a week just on one platform. That could be done if the machines were utilized more fully.
2020-04-20,01:06:40,Unnamed,I have a question for Admiral Giroir.
2020-04-20,01:06:40,Donald Trump,For? Yes.
2020-04-20,01:06:45,Unnamed,"Hi, Admiral Giroir. You said that there, and the vice president has said this and Mr. Smith said it, that there will be enough tests in place for phase one."
2020-04-20,01:06:52,Unnamed,There are.
2020-04-20,01:06:53,Unnamed,"There are… The question is, what’s the standard of testing that you now have the capability for? Is it, test people who are only very ill? Is it test people who have the sniffles? Is it test people who come in just because they want to get a test? I mean, what is the standard here for the testing?"
2020-04-20,01:07:11,Brett Giroir,"It is the guidelines. But, I tried to be a little specific about this on Friday, and we all try to. Number one is, you need to test everyone who’s symptomatic, right? And you need to over test them, because-"
2020-04-20,01:07:22,Unnamed,How symptomatic?
2020-04-20,01:07:23,Brett Giroir,"We’re talking any symptoms that would be consistent with COVID, right? So… And there’s a wide range of symptoms, you want to test them and you want to over test. And we talked about the approximate metric with Ambassador Birx, fully supports because we… This is a good metric that you want to get about one positive for every 10 tests, then you know you over-sample. Second, and this is a really important part of the strategy, is because so many people are asymptomatic. There’s no way that you can test enough people to pull one asymptomatic out of 300 people in the population. So the strategy with… Ambassador Birx offered, and I talked to epidemiologist around the country, and they go, “Wow, I wish I would have thought of that.” Is to really focus on the vulnerable population where we know that the asymptomatic rate could be much higher than the rest of the population."
2020-04-20,01:08:15,Brett Giroir,"And we are going to be focusing, and this is what my office does during normal times, focusing on the underserved populations, particularly in inner cities and urban areas, they have a higher rate because overcrowding, they can’t telework, they’re subject to a lot of comorbid conditions. Nursing homes, we all know about nursing homes and there’s both symptomatic and asymptomatic spread. And finally, some of our indigenous populations in the Indian Health Service. So this is a very important layer that most of the models and people don’t talk about, because that’s where we’re going to pick up the asymptomatic carrier tune. When you do that, that’s when you focus on track and trace."
2020-04-20,01:08:53,Unnamed,"Sir, just a quick follow-up on that. If we have enough tests right now for everyone to go into phase one, why is the Governor of Maryland having to get half a million tests from South Korea?"
2020-04-20,01:09:02,Brett Giroir,"I don’t know what the Governor of Maryland is doing in South Korea, but there is excess capacity every day. If he wanted to send 30 or 40,000 tests to LabCorps and Quest, that could be done, that could be done tomorrow."
2020-04-20,01:09:17,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:09:17] that they need it to start… To up their testing capacity and make it adequate. So they had to [crosstalk 01:09:22] South Korea.
2020-04-20,01:09:22,Brett Giroir,"I think we’re seeing all across the country that in the states that have been hardest hit, their capacity… None of their capacity… They’re testing far exceeds South Korea, and they’ve been able to do that on a relatively straightforward basis. I don’t know what the Governor of Maryland… We talked to him today, he didn’t bring that up today."
2020-04-20,01:09:40,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:09:39].
2020-04-20,01:09:41,Brett Giroir,We were on the governor’s call today?
2020-04-20,01:09:43,Unnamed,[inaudible 01:09:43] personally on this.
2020-04-20,01:09:44,Unnamed,[inaudible 01:09:45].
2020-04-20,01:09:47,Mike Pence,"We spoke to Governor Hogan today, I’ll follow up. Because I heard there was an announcement today about… That he had acquired some tests from overseas. Maybe we can put the slide back up that showed the number of facilities just in the State of Maryland. And part of our process, and I don’t know when the governor placed the order from South Korea, wouldn’t begrudge him or his health officials for ordering tests. But, the capacity of all the different laboratories and the number of machines that are across Maryland, was part of what we were communicating today. Including federal facilities, NIH is in Maryland, there’s Department of Defense facilities and… What we assured the governor then and we assured all the governors is that, we’ll open up all of those facilities. But, John back to your point. There was one other element of that, that’s the phase one testing. And I can’t really describe it as well as the doctors here, but it’s the contact tracing piece."
2020-04-20,01:10:49,Mike Pence,"Where we really believe that states that meet the criteria 14 days of cases going down and proper hospital capacity, if they test people that have symptoms and if they deploy resources to vulnerable populations, nursing homes and other designated vulnerable populations where we believe the threat of serious outcomes from the coronavirus is real. Then we also today informed the governors, that we will be deploying CDC teams to every state and every territory in the country to assist them in contact tracing. Governor Jared Polis raised a very good point about the legislation. The president is currently negotiating on Capitol Hill. He recommended that we make sure that the new bill that has some $25 billion in testing resources also cover contact tracing expenses by states. We assured him our administration strongly supports that. We communicated that to the Secretary of the Treasury and the rest of our negotiation team and we’ll be pursuing that."
2020-04-20,01:11:54,Mike Pence,"But we were able to tell every one of the governors that we will be deploying teams, we think of 10 or 12 for a start from CDC to reside in all of our states and territories to supervise and work with contractors and others to do the kind of contact tracing. So it’s test people that don’t feel well and they have the coronavirus, keep a careful eye and monitor your vulnerable populations. And when you come across a case, have a team on the ground that can do the immediate contact tracing and testing. And that’s how we restrain and contain the spread of the coronavirus during phase one. And frankly, it’s the beginning of the structure for how we contain the coronavirus going forward."
2020-04-20,01:12:39,Unnamed,"Sir, just-"
2020-04-20,01:12:39,Donald Trump,"And take a look at that map. If the Governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence, he could have saved a lot of money. Look at all of the… Look at these different places, and that’s Maryland right there. So, he could have saved a lot of money, but that’s okay."
2020-04-20,01:12:51,Unnamed,"So, you’re saying he didn’t need to go to South Korea for these testing kits."
2020-04-20,01:12:53,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a little knowledge, would have been helpful."
2020-04-20,01:12:56,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:01:12:54].
2020-04-20,01:12:57,Unnamed,"On the SBA loans, do you think it’s right that major corporations, major institutions like the [inaudible 01:13:01] restaurant chain, like Harvard University, apparently got a lot of money under the CARES Act, money that was supposed to be earmarked for small business owners, do you think that’s fair?"
2020-04-20,01:13:10,Donald Trump,"Well, I know one thing, I didn’t get any, that’s for sure. I didn’t get any. We’ll look at individual things, and some people will have to return it if we think it’s inappropriate"
2020-04-20,01:13:18,Unnamed,"Or, should the criteria be changed so that money goes to people who need it the most?"
2020-04-20,01:13:21,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s being done by great professionals, it’s being done by banks, and as you know community banks all over the country, they’re… That’s what they do. They loan money and they’re supposed to do it according to not only criteria, but according to what we think is right. But if somebody got something that we think is inappropriate, we’ll get it back. Good point. Please, go ahead."
2020-04-20,01:13:40,Unnamed,"Yes. Another… A different question about South Korea. There are reports that you are personally negotiating with President Moon the terms of reduction of US Forces on the Korean Peninsula and that there are four scenarios involved, can you confirm that? And if so, what is your desired outcome?"
2020-04-20,01:13:56,Donald Trump,"Well, I think that South Korea… I had a great talk with President Moon, he’s a friend of mine. I congratulate… He had a wonderful election victory. I was very happy about that. He was… As you know, just recently… No, we are negotiating for President Moon and for South Korea to help us monetarily. Because, we, as you know, we have 32,000 soldiers there, that varies from 28 to 32,000 in South Korea. And we think that… Before I came aboard, they paid very little, if anything. So we’re defending a wonderful nation, a nation that we have great relationships, but we’re asking them to pay for a big percentage of what we’re doing. It’s not fair. So, it’s not a question of reduction. It’s a question of will they contribute toward the defense of their own nation. We’re defending nations that are very wealthy. South Korea is a very wealthy nation. They make our television sets, they make ships, they make everything, and I give them great credit."
2020-04-20,01:14:56,Donald Trump,"We’ve been defending them for many decades, as you know, many… Over eight decades. And I’ve gone to them in the past. Last year I went to them and now they’re paying $1 billion a year. And I went to them again, I said, “Look, I’ll be back because that’s just a fraction.” And again, the relationship is a great, but it’s just not a fair relationship. We renegotiated the trade deal and made it a much more equitable deal than it was in the past. It was a terrible deal. It was done by Hillary Clinton. It was a terrible deal. The new deal is a much more equitable deal that’s on trade. But on the military, I mean, we’re paying for the military to defend another nation that’s 8,500 miles away. And they’re not the only one I’m talking to by the way, as you know. I won’t go into names. But I’ve done this, nobody talks about it."
2020-04-20,01:15:45,Donald Trump,"But I think it’s appropriate. I think the taxpayer of our country… Taxpayers want to hear these things. And so now, they’re… They’ve offered us a certain amount of money and I’ve rejected it. I just said, “It’s just… Look, we’re doing a tremendous service. We have a wonderful feeling and a wonderful relationship with each other, but we have to be treated equitably and fairly.” And so, that’s where it is right now. And what’s going to happen, I can’t tell you, but we’ll find out fairly soon. But, I congratulate the president who’s a friend of mine. I congratulate President Moon on having a terrific victory. Please."
2020-04-20,01:16:22,Unnamed,"A question for you about Governor Cuomo’s visit, and then also a question for Dr. Birx, if you all may."
2020-04-20,01:16:27,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-04-20,01:16:30,Unnamed,The New York Governor along with the National Governors Association in the past have called for aid to be unrestricted as a lot of state and local governments see their revenues drop. Are you open to the idea of unrestricted aid or do you want it to be pandemic specific?
2020-04-20,01:16:46,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to be talking about that in phase four, as you know, which we’ll start very shortly. That has to do with infrastructure, hopefully infrastructure, because this country needs infrastructure. We spend all this money in the Middle East, $8 trillion, with a T, dollars in the Middle East. But if you have a pothole in a highway someplace, they don’t want you to spend the money to fix it. How stupid have we been in this country? How stupid have we been? And that’s changing rapidly, you know that, you’ve seen that. Including things like negotiating with friends. But when we are helping friends, friends should reimburse us for the cost."
2020-04-20,01:17:23,Donald Trump,"I mean, why should we be defending nations for free? We’re defending a nation for free. Now I’m getting $1 billion a year and we’re… We’ll be getting… We were offered much more than that, but I turned it down. So that’s where we are with that. As far as the other is concerned, look, we have to be smart in this country. We’ve been taken to the cleaner by every… And I mean, with allies, not just with the enemies, with allies. We’ve been to… Frankly, the allies have taken us much more so than the enemies. The enemies we don’t do business with, right? The allies we do business with… And whoever made these deals, whoever made these contracts, in many cases, we didn’t have a contract. We didn’t have a contract…"
2020-04-20,01:18:03,Donald Trump,"In many cases, we didn’t have a contract, like we didn’t have a contract, we didn’t have a trade deal with China. They came in and they took $500 billion a year for many years, but anywhere from 200 to $550 billion a year out of our hides. Now we made this great trade deal. Unfortunately, that was a number of months ago and it’s a great deal. They’re paying 25% on $250 billion. A lot of things happening. They’re going to have to purchase $250 billion worth of goods, including farm product up to $50 billion. So a lot of good things are happening. But then what happened with China was the plague hit us, right, the plague. That was after. This was long after we signed the deal. The plague hit us, so I’m not happy about that. Okay. John, please."
2020-04-20,01:18:48,John (Reporter),"A question for Dr. Birx, if I could. Dr Birx, a question on the virus itself. As it passes from patient to patient and mutates, over time have you picked up any indication that it has become less virulent? Have you picked up any indication it has become more virulent?"
2020-04-20,01:19:07,Dr. Deborah Birx,"You know, that is an excellent question because we watch that all the time, particularly with RNA viruses, to really track its adaptation to humans. I mean, you’re really asking has this virus become more adapted to humans and more able to spread, or is it becoming less adapted to humans and less able to spread? We don’t have any indication that it’s less able to spread, and we’ll have good analyses that will come from, obviously the Roosevelt had its incident with the virus outside of the United States, and we’ll be able to look at those parameters, and the DOD and the military have done a great job in really ensuring the health of the sailors, but also ensuring thar these questions can really be asked and answered."
2020-04-20,01:19:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We have extraordinary evolutionary molecular biologists in this country all around the United States, and they’re looking at this very question, and a lot of the work that we’ve been doing and you’ll see a lot of work happening with testing in New Mexico and testing in other states. They have extraordinary molecular biologists that are evolutionary biologists, and they’ll be able to look at that both in New Mexico that may have lower transmission rates, and compare that to New York that has maybe 10 X the transmission. But it’s an excellent question and it’s something that will be able to be answered by what we see in the United States."
2020-04-20,01:20:32,Donald Trump,"John, what a good question that was. Where did that come from?"
2020-04-20,01:20:35,John (Reporter),"Every once in a while, I pull it out of my hat, Mr. President."
2020-04-20,01:20:36,Donald Trump,"No, that’s very impressive. You know when Senator Schumer wrote a letter a couple of months ago and he said, “You should use admirals and generals.” I said, “Well, first of all, we have our Vice President has been incredible, but we have the admirals, we have the generals,” and I was just talking to the Admiral inside just before we came out. I said, “Did you go to Annapolis?” He said, “No, sir.” I said, “Oh, that’s too bad. That’s too bad. Where did you go?” He said, “I went to Harvard.” Oh, that’s okay too, I guess. Right? So you went to Harvard and he was a great student at Harvard. He’s doing a fantastic job. And this young gentleman was very, very successful, but he wanted to help the country. He wanted to come into the country and we appreciate it very much. He was a big success, big, big success. Let’s do here and there next. Okay. We’re all set. Go ahead."
2020-04-20,01:21:27,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. I was hoping you talked about your meeting tomorrow with Governor Cuomo that you mentioned. Is there a reason he’s coming all the way down here?"
2020-04-20,01:21:33,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. He wanted to [crosstalk 01:21:35] and we believe it or not, we get along, okay? He was very generous yesterday in particular, said we did a “phenomenal deal.” I don’t know if anybody wrote that, but he said that and I appreciated it because it’s not about me. It’s about these people and thousands behind Mike, and the Admiral, and all of the other people that are working with us. I mean, and you see it. Look, I don’t understand when I see a polling and approval ratings for the job. I mean, this group should get a 95. It really should. And we’re really helping the governors. And the governors call me, the ones I know, or the Republicans, but the ones I know, and they say it’s incredible the job you’re doing. Again, not me, the job this group is doing. And you sit here and I’m watching from the corner and I’m just saying, boy, it’s incredible stuff."
2020-04-20,01:22:29,Donald Trump,"When you watch the General get up, General Semonite, and talk about boom, boom, boom. You don’t see that. You don’t see that. When you hear the Admiral speak about the testing, how good it is, and yet people don’t like to say it. But remember, it was all about ventilators a month ago. Ventilators, ventilators, then we fixed it. You don’t hear about ventilators. Where is the ventilator? Jeff, you haven’t asked about ventilators recently. What’s going on? What about ventilators? We’re helping other countries now because they can’t have, they’re very hard to come by and they take a long time to make, like years."
2020-04-20,01:23:02,Donald Trump,"It’s incredible the job they’ve done, that our people have done, and also private companies have done. You know, you talk about the Act. We don’t like to use it unless we have to, but a lot of times just the fact that you have it, gets you everything you need. So you know, we don’t want to embarrass any of the companies, but we have used it on a number of occasions, and it worked. But it works just as well before you have to use it because they don’t want to be embarrassed and I don’t want to embarrass them because they’ve done a great job. Please go ahead."
2020-04-20,01:23:32,Chanel Rion,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-20,01:23:32,Donald Trump,"No, I think Rick behind you. I promised. I cannot tell a lie. So I mean we’ll get you next. Okay?"
2020-04-20,01:23:38,Unnamed,Are you talking to her or me?
2020-04-20,01:23:38,Donald Trump,"No no, you."
2020-04-20,01:23:41,Unnamed,"Me, okay. Well, thank you so much, Mr. President. My question, I have two questions, the first one is on testing. You talked about the idea that first it was ventilators, now it’s testing. You seem to maybe possibly be implying that talking about testing as a personal attack on you. Can you explain why you think testing, talking about testing, is a personal attack given that the access to testing has been an issue for a long time. There’s bipartisan outcry still today that there’s not enough testing. Why do you think it’s a personal attack on you?"
2020-04-20,01:24:06,Donald Trump,"Well, it’s not bipartisan. It’s mostly partisan, but more importantly than mostly partisan, it’s incorrect. You have the experts. Look at these maps. I mean, you have the maps with so many different locations. In the case of, as an example, Governor Hogan, he didn’t really know. It was very obvious to any of those listening to the call today, even though you weren’t supposed to be on it, I’m sure that some of you were, or representatives were, he really didn’t know about the federal laboratories. Would you say that’s correct, Mike? He didn’t know. He didn’t know and Mike doesn’t like to get into this stuff. He’s less controversial than I am, but he didn’t know about it. And if he did know about it, he would have been happy. No, we’ve done a really good job in testing. Now, with that being said, we have tests coming out perhaps over the next two weeks that will blow the whole industry away."
2020-04-20,01:24:57,Donald Trump,"Now, a lot of people love the Abbot tests. So do I. You know, the Abbott test is great because it’s boom, they touch, they put it in, in five minutes you have… The problem is that doesn’t do massive numbers like the big machine. But the big machine takes a day, takes a day and a half with delivery and everything else. But we have tremendous testing, tremendous testing capability. Remember this, we’ve tested more than any country in the world by far. In fact, I think I read where if you add up every other country in the world, we’ve tested more."
2020-04-20,01:25:33,Donald Trump,"But remember this, we’re dealing in politics. We’re dealing with a thing called November 3rd of this year. Do you know what November 3rd represents? Right? You know better than anybody in the room. November 3rd of this year, it’s called the presidential election. No matter what I do, no matter where we go, no matter how well we do, no matter what, if I came up with a tablet, you take it and this plague is gone, they’ll say Trump did a terrible job, terrible, terrible. Because that’s their soundbite. That’s the political soundbite. They know the great job we’ve done."
2020-04-20,01:26:08,Donald Trump,"But with all of that being said, and also, there is a thing that somebody could talk to if they want, but I don’t want to bore you with it. Not everybody believes we should do so much testing. You don’t need so much. We’re talking about maximum maximum. The reason that the Democrats and some others maybe because they don’t know, they want maximum because they want to be able to criticize, because it’s almost impossible to get to the maximum number, and yet we’ve been able to do it already. But with that, and you’ll be seeing this over the next, I think over the next couple of weeks or sooner, we have a test. If it comes out, it’ll revolutionize the whole world of testing. It’ll be something really special. So I don’t view it as personal at all. What I do say is it’s something that’s not fair to thousands of people that have done such a good job."
2020-04-20,01:26:54,Unnamed,"That second question is about your language and how you approached the coronavirus at the beginning. I interviewed someone who said that his family got sick. They went to a funeral in mid-March. And they said mainly because the President wasn’t taking it serious, and he said, “If the President had had a mask on, if he was saying we should stay home, then I would have stayed home.” [crosstalk 01:27:13] But he said his family members were sick and because they were listening to you, do you feel like or are you concerned that downplaying the virus maybe got some people sick?"
2020-04-20,01:27:24,Donald Trump,"And a lot of people love Trump, right? A lot of people love me. You see them all the time, right? I guess I’m here for a reason, you know. To the best of my knowledge, I won, and I think we’re going to win again. I think we’re going to win in a landslide. But just so you understand, you’re talking about March, right? And yet, [crosstalk 01:27:42] excuse me, excuse me. I know, I understand. And yet in January, a certain date, you know the date better than I do, we put on a ban of China where China can’t come in, and before March we put on a ban in Europe where Europe can’t come in. So how could you say I wasn’t taking it seriously? You know, I put on a ban on China before anybody in this country died. I put on a ban and so you tell me. Nancy Pelosi, she wanted to have a street party in Chinatown in San Francisco at the end of February."
2020-04-20,01:28:18,Donald Trump,"That’s a month later. And then they tell me it’s only a political talking point, but you feed into it because you’re too good a reporter to let that happen. Really, you are a good reporter. You’re too good a reporter to let that happen. Remember this. So at the end of January, I put on a ban. People that were in that room will tell you. I think there were 21 people. I was the only one in the whole room that wanted to do it. Fortunately, I was the one that counted for that purpose. We put on a ban because I was reading bad things about China. World Health Organization should have told us, but I was reading it with or without them. They should have known. All they had to do is read it. They didn’t have to even be there, but they tried to cover up for China."
2020-04-20,01:28:55,Donald Trump,"World Health covered up for China. [crosstalk 01:28:58] But no, no wait, but you can’t say this. I put on a ban. In other words, I stopped China from coming to the United States. I stopped Europe from coming into the United States long before the March date that you’re talking about. So people should say I acted very early. That was a very hard thing to do. Doing that was a very hard thing. I didn’t want to do that. [crosstalk 01:29:19] But I did it because I thought, and Dr. Fauci said that by doing it, President Trump saved tens of thousands of lives. So I did take it very seriously."
2020-04-20,01:29:29,Unnamed,You held rallies in February and in March. And there are some American-
2020-04-20,01:29:32,Donald Trump,"Oh, I don’t know about rallies. I really don’t know about rallies. I know one thing [crosstalk 01:29:35], I haven’t left the White House in months, except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, The Comfort-"
2020-04-20,01:29:43,Unnamed,You held a rally in March.
2020-04-20,01:29:45,Donald Trump,"I don’t know. Did I hold a rally? I’m sorry. I hold a rally. Did I hold the rally? Let me tell you. In January when I did this, you had virtually no cases and no deaths, and yet I put it on. So how could I not? Why was Nancy Pelosi, right, Nancy Pelosi is holding a street fair. She wants a street fair in San Francisco in Chinatown to prove, you know what the purpose of it, was to prove that there’s no problem. Many other politicians did the same thing and wanted to prove [crosstalk 01:30:16] while I was… No, of course not. No, no, no. People are amazed at how early I acted and I did act early. With that being said, it’s very hard to say, let’s close down the greatest economy in the history of the world. I had it closed down, I and everybody else that works with me, and close to 350 million people built the greatest economy in the history of the world, best employment numbers, best stock market numbers, best numbers in virtually every category, even good manufacturing numbers."
2020-04-20,01:30:48,Donald Trump,"The previous administration said manufacturing was dead for our country, even great manufacturing numbers and you know what? I did that and somebody walked into my office and said, “Sir, you’re going to have to close down the economy. You’re going to have to close the country.” But you know what I say to you? We’re going to rebuild it, and we’re going to rebuild it better, and it’s going to go faster than people think. I built it once. I build it a second time. Please."
2020-04-20,01:31:11,Chanel Rion,"Mr. President, thank you, Chanel Rion with One America News."
2020-04-20,01:31:14,Donald Trump,Please. Go ahead.
2020-04-20,01:31:17,Chanel Rion,"Going back to the topic of friendship and bipartisanship, Americans with the exception of Pelosi, Schumer and even Romney, Americans have seen an unprecedented chapter of bipartisanship and cooperation on the political landscape. On a personal note, what has been the most significant signal that your relationship with Democrats [inaudible 01:31:39] level have changed for the good of America?"
2020-04-20,01:31:42,Donald Trump,"I think it’s a great question because there is bipartisanship. Look, we’re getting the paycheck plan. It’s already 350 billion was approved, essentially unanimously, and we have another 250 which I think you’re going to find out is going to be a higher number than that. Okay. I won’t say it now because I don’t know if they’ve released it or not, but it’s going to end up being more than 250 billion, and this is going to small businesses, and is going to workers, and these are really bipartisan plans. It’s a great thing that’s happening. So I think the fact that we’re able to do all of this in a bipartisan way is great."
2020-04-20,01:32:18,Donald Trump,"Now the tax cuts that the Republicans did, we had no help from the Democrats. So you can’t say that’s bipartisan, but this whole thing getting our country back, and you know, Nancy Pelosi’s been, she’s very nasty. She wasted a lot of time with a impeachment hoax. It was a total hoax, went nowhere, and that was not good. And Schumer, I guess it’s the same thing, but he sort of accepted it. He just did what he was supposed to do and he didn’t do very well with it. But you know, that was not appropriate. That was a bad thing for our country. But it was fine. I mean, I understand the game. They have a little bit of a majority, so they say, let’s do something and let’s try and stir it up."
2020-04-20,01:32:58,Donald Trump,"But they wasted a year. They wasted tremendous. We could have been doing things that would have been great for our country. They could have been looking into China. They should have been looking into China as an example. A lot of people are blaming the Democrats for wasting all that time because it was during that period of time, as you know, that it was fomenting, but I think we’ve had a great spirit of bipartisanship in a certain way."
2020-04-20,01:33:21,Donald Trump,"I wouldn’t say we’re going to set records throughout the world, but things are happening that are very good. The country is coming together, and I’ll tell you what, the people are coming together. The people are really coming together. I think you’re going to find that our country is much more unified. I do think that the press, the media foments a lot of anger. I really believe it foments tremendous anger. For instance, I’ll be asked a tremendously hostile question from somebody, and then I’ll answer it in a hostile way, which is appropriate. otherwise you look foolish. Otherwise it looks like just walk off the stage and bow your head. I can’t do that. You know? I just can’t do that. But a lot of these questions that are asked from certain networks are so hostile and there’s no reason for it."
2020-04-20,01:34:10,Donald Trump,"There’s no reason for it. We are in a war. This is a World War II. This is a World War I, where by the way, the war essentially ended because of a plague. That was one of the worst ever. They lost almost a hundred million people. But we’re in a big war. And I’ll say one thing about, because I think it’s important, the last person, I did it early, but I was the last person that wanted to close down one of the great economic, you can’t call it an experiment, but everything I guess in life is an experiment. So let’s say experiments, but one of the great economic stories in history, I’m the last person that wanted to do it, but we did the right thing, because if we didn’t do it, you would’ve had a million people, a million and a half people, maybe two million people dead."
2020-04-20,01:34:59,Donald Trump,"Now we’re going toward 50, I’m hearing, or 60,000 people. One is too many. I always say it. One is too many, but we’re going toward 50 or 60,000 people. That’s at the lower, as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people. We could end up at 50 to 60. Okay, it’s horrible. If we didn’t do what we did, we would have had, I think, a million people, maybe 2 million people, maybe more than that. And you look it, there’s one country in particular that decided let’s wing it. Let’s just keep going. They are being inundated with death."
2020-04-20,01:35:43,Donald Trump,"Now if you take a look at some of the hospitals, where one of them I knew growing up in Queens, and I’m looking at the bodies laying in hallways being brought into refrigerator trucks, the trucks, these massive trucks, bodies going in, multiply that times 10. It’s not sustainable. And many of the people that have this theory, Oh let’s, you know, maybe we could have just gone right through. I was somebody that would have loved to have done that, but it wouldn’t have been sustainable. You can’t lose a million people. That’s almost double what we lost in the Civil War. I use that as a guide, Civil War, 600,000 people died. So it’s not sustainable."
2020-04-20,01:36:28,Donald Trump,"But it could have been much more than a million people. I mean if you took a number and cut it in half and half and in half again, you’d end up at 500,000 people, okay, if you want to make a very conservative guesstimate. 500,000 people is not acceptable. Is that a correct sort of an analogy? So I mean I see it all the time. My friends of mine, people that I have great respect for. Well we could have done this, we could have done, and remember this, when we say 50 and they compare 50 to the 35 of the flu, because it’s averaged 35, 36,000 over a 10 year period. It’s a lot. Who would think that?"
2020-04-20,01:37:03,Donald Trump,"But we’re not talking about with the flu. It just goes. We’re not locking ourselves in our units. We’re not locking ourselves in our apartments and not moving and not touching anybody and just saying, you know, the world. In this case we are, and we’re still going to lose between 50 and 60, but if we just kept it going on a normal basis, which is really the only standard that you can compare it to with the flu, because that was a normal basis. You get into an airplane, you travel to Florida, you go to Texas, you go wherever you’re going. But in this case, if we didn’t do anything, the number wouldn’t be 50 to 60,000, the number would be a million people dead. It would be 1,000,005, 1,000,002, maybe 700,000. It would have been a number in like that, and it’s so important because I see so much."
2020-04-20,01:37:57,Donald Trump,"Oh well, you know. You can’t compare it because I’ll tell you what, the people of this country, what they’ve done, they’ve gone out of their had the way they’ve lived. It’s not great. It’s terrible. Maybe the first three days, they’re all of a sudden, you see what’s going on. They want to get going, and I get that fully. But I just say this. If we would have done that, we would’ve lost anywhere from a million to more than two million people. Now, with all of the death that we’ve seen at 50 or 60,000 people heading toward, right now it’s at 40, but 50 or 60,000 people, probably over 54, and [inaudible 01:38:37], but that’s with our guard up. If we took our guard down and just said, “Okay, we’re just going to keep this open,” we would have lost millions of people."
2020-04-20,01:38:47,Donald Trump,"Can you imagine? Look how bad it looks now when you look at the bodies, when you look at Hart Island in New York where they have the mass grave, and all of the things that you see, can you imagine if we had the guard down, if we didn’t do anything and we just said, “Let’s ride it out?” It would not have been sustainable in any way. It would have been an atrocity. So we’ve done the right thing. We’ve really done the right thing. And the people that have worked so hard and dangerously, I’ll tell you again, I say it, but I watched those doctors and nurses and medical people running into those hospitals, and they don’t even have that gear on. Forget about gear, whether it’s great gear or not, and we’re bringing in the best gear in the world, but they’re running in with open everything."
2020-04-20,01:39:35,Donald Trump,"I mean, the job, they like warriors, the job they’re doing. But if we didn’t do the moves that we made, you would have had a million, a million and a half, 2 million people dead. So multiply that times 50, you’re talking about you would’ve had 10 to 20 to 25 times more people dead than all of the people that we’ve been watching. That’s not acceptable. The 50,000 is not acceptable. It’s so horrible. But can you imagine multiplying that out by 20 or more? It’s not acceptable. So it’s a very good question. I appreciate it. We’ll see you tomorrow. We’ll see you tomorrow."
2020-04-20,01:40:26,Mike Pence,"Thanks, everybody."
2020-04-21,03:04,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much everyone. Very big day today. I want to start by saying that our love and prayers of every American continue to be with our fellow citizens who’ve lost a cherished friend or family member to the virus. Amidst our grief we are making tremendous strides against this invisible enemy. Thanks to our aggressive campaign against the virus and the extraordinary talent of our medical professionals our mortality rate remains roughly half of that of many other countries and one of the lowest of any country in the world. And that’s due to a lot of things, but our medical professionals have been incredible."
2020-04-21,03:54,Donald Trump,"Since we announced our guidelines on opening up America, as we call it, we say opening up America and we add the word again. I think we can add the word probably again, but that’s what it is. We’re opening up America again. 20 States representing 40% of the US population have announced that they are making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future. So that’s 20 States, it’s about 40% of our country. They’re moving along pretty quickly. Three announced today, as you know, and they’re going to be doing it safely. They are going to be doing it with tremendous passion. They want to get back to work. The country wants to get back to work."
2020-04-21,04:41,Donald Trump,"A short time ago, the Senate passed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act with additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, hospitals and testing, a lot of money for. All of them, especially for our workers and our small businesses. My administration has worked aggressively with Congress to negotiate this critical $482 billion funding package. We reached a deal that includes $382 billion in crucial small business support to keep workers on the payroll, $75 billion to aid hospitals, which really need the aid and very badly, very proud of that, and $25 billion to support coronavirus testing efforts. I urge the house to pass the bill and they’re going to be voted on it, I imagine very, very soon."
2020-04-21,05:38,Donald Trump,"I think while we’re here, and so he’s a very busy manager, as you know, Secretary Mnuchin, he’s going to be running back, so I thought we’ll talk about that now and we’ll take a couple of questions on that and then he can go and start phase four as the ink is drank. Probably they’ll be voting tomorrow in the house, shortly. And I think we have tremendous support. So Steve, please come up, say a few words."
2020-04-21,06:06,Steve Mnuchin,"Thank you Mr. President and thank you for all your work with us to get this passed. I’d especially like to thank Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer and the entire Senate for passing this. I’d also like to thank Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi who have been working with us around the clock as well, and our chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who was also very instrumental in this. Let me just comment. We’ve had tremendous support for the PPP. This gives us another $310 billion for the PPP. We look forward to the house passing this tomorrow and being up and running quickly after that. This also gives us $50 billion for disaster loans, idle loans that will allow the SBA to make $300 billion of disaster loans all for small businesses. It also allows us, as the president said, more money to hospitals and an unprecedented amount of money for testing. And again I think we understand hospitals, not only the hospitals that have been impacted by coronavirus, but more importantly many hospitals that have been shut down and making sure that the doctors and nurses get money."
2020-04-21,07:16,Steve Mnuchin,"Now let me make a just one more comment on the program. We have over a million companies that have received this with less than 10 workers. So there is very broad participation in really small business. I will comment, there have been some big businesses that have taken these loans. I was pleased to see that Shake Shack returned to the money. We will be putting out some FAQs. There is a certification that people are making and I asked people just make sure the intent of this was for business that needed the money. We’ll put out an FAQ. But again, the intent of this money was not for big public companies that have access to capital."
2020-04-21,07:57,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:07:57] Harvard, you might say."
2020-04-21,07:59,Unnamed,"So Mr. Secretary, are you going to request that those other companies, because obviously Shake Shack was not alone in being a big company that got money in this. Are you going to request-"
2020-04-21,08:08,Donald Trump,I’m going to request.
2020-04-21,08:08,Unnamed,You’re going to ask them to return that money?
2020-04-21,08:10,Donald Trump,"Yep. Harvard’s going to pay back the money and they shouldn’t be taking it. So Harvard’s going to. You have a number of, I’m not going to mention any other names, but when I saw Harvard, they have one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country, maybe in the world, I guess. And they’re going to pay back that money."
2020-04-21,08:30,Steve Mnuchin,"I just want to clarify because certain people on the PPP may have not been clear in understanding the certification. So we will give people the benefit of the doubt. We’re going to put an FAQ out, explain the certification. If you pay back the loan right away, you won’t have liability to the SBA and to Treasury. But there are severe consequences for people who don’t attest properly to a certification. And again, we want to make sure this money is available to small businesses that needed people who have invested their entire life savings. We appreciate what’s going on and they’re hiring people back."
2020-04-21,09:06,Unnamed,"And how are we going to ensure that those small businesses, the small restaurants, cafes, bars, who did not get the money last time around are going to get at this time?"
2020-04-21,09:14,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, as I said, there are a million of these companies that did get it that are very small. We’re working with the banks. We’re extremely pleased that the small banks did great. 20% of the loans were made by banks of a billion and less, 60% by $20 billion in less. And the big banks also, we want everybody to participate. There’s now a lot of money back in the program and we look forward to all these small businesses getting access to funds. Brett, it’s great to see you."
2020-04-21,09:42,Bret Baier,"Thank you Mr. Secretary and do you know, estimate how long this is going to take. That other pot of money obviously went quickly. Do you assume this is going to go quickly as well?"
2020-04-21,09:51,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, let me just say, we’re pleased with the success of this program and how quickly this got up operationally. We’ve put out more money in these SBA loans than in the last 10 years of SBA. So I want to thank all the banks that have worked really hard. We knew that when we passed this originally, if there was full takeout, we wouldn’t have enough money. That’s why we’ve worked with Congress for more money and this is going to… We’ve already impacted about 30 million workers. There’ll be a lot more. So we look forward to this having a big impact on the economy."
2020-04-21,10:24,Unnamed,"Yesterday the president said he would look into the issue of felons, those criminal convictions getting access to some of these programs. I was wondering if you have an update on that."
2020-04-21,10:33,Steve Mnuchin,"Sure, we worked with the White House on this. There were actually much more onerous restrictions in the SBA program. There were people who had misdemeanors that weren’t allowed to access the program. It was much longer than five years, and we very much because of the criminal reform legislation that was passed and the work that’s been done in the White House by Jared and others, we specifically designed the program and the five years was significantly shorter than what had been done before. So we had already taken that into account. [crosstalk 00:11:04]."
2020-04-21,11:03,Steve Mnuchin,"For now we’re not going to do that, but I want to just emphasize, we did take this into account. There were a lot of people that wouldn’t have access previously and we changed those regulations."
2020-04-21,11:13,Unnamed,"The president talked about a phase four. I know we all understand the circumstances and why businesses need this, but how many more phases can we afford to have or can businesses expect to have? Do you see a phase five, a phase six, a phase seven? What’s your thinking on this?"
2020-04-21,11:30,Steve Mnuchin,"First of all, I very much appreciate the president’s support for phase four. He put out a tweet as the president said, we would look forward to phase four. It would be infrastructure. The president’s been talking about infrastructure since the campaign. Roads, bridges, broadband, especially broadband now to rural America is very important. We’ve talked about incentives for restaurants, sports, entertainment because these businesses have been impacted. The president has talked multiple times about a payroll tax cut. And we’ve also, we’re talking about in the case of states, we’ve heard from the governors and the fiscal issues of the states."
2020-04-21,12:07,Steve Mnuchin,"I think phase four will most likely be what we need. I think based upon what we’re seeing and the reopening of the economy and the amount of money we’re putting in and working with the federal reserve on 133 I think you’re going to see a lot of liquidity and we look forward to business rebounding, especially later this summer."
2020-04-21,12:27,Unnamed,"Just real quick to follow up and the PPP program, is this the last traunch of money you think you’re going to need for small businesses?"
2020-04-21,12:33,Steve Mnuchin,"We would expect is is the last traunch, but obviously we can always reconsider that. But this is a lot of money going out. Again, let me just be clear. It’s another $310 billion here and a another $300 billion of loans. That’s over $600 billion putting into small businesses, which are the backbone of the economy. 50% of the private payroll."
2020-04-21,12:54,Unnamed,How much do you think phase four will cost and it will include all of those things?
2020-04-21,12:59,Steve Mnuchin,It’s premature for us to comment what the cost is. We’ll work with Congress on that and we’ll consider it. Infrastructure can be a big investment.
2020-04-21,13:07,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, given the size of the tax payer dollars that are going out the door, you fellas come to a different way of thinking about the need for oversight, independent oversight on behalf of the taxpayer?"
2020-04-21,13:17,Steve Mnuchin,"We have independent oversight. We supported in the last legislation. Let me be very clear. We have a new inspector general. The president has already picked someone for that position. We look forward to the person being confirmed. We have an oversight committee of Congress that many of them have already been appointed. And let me just say, we put up last week for full transparency. We have no obligation to do this. We put up, you can go to treasury.gov, full transparency on the money that had been sent out on the PPP across states showing all the big lenders, how it was distributed. No one lender did more than 4%. showed the businesses."
2020-04-21,13:54,Steve Mnuchin,"So again, the president and I very much believe in full transparency. We’re spending a lot of money and we want to make sure that it’s done effectively and fairly."
2020-04-21,14:03,Unnamed,"Mr. Secretary, thank you. You started by thanking the leaders in the House and the Senate. Can you tell us more about how easy or hard it was to deal with both sides?"
2020-04-21,14:12,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, we’ve been working around the clock. I think there’s been very good bipartisan support to get this done. The Congress is coming together understanding the importance of this. And we’ve been working around the clock for days. So this is important legislation. It was a lot. We spoke to a lot of people. Mark Meadows has been fantastic, as I said, it’s great to have him here in the White House. I couldn’t have done this without him working on this with me and the president and vice president had been available to us around the clock. So this was a big team effort."
2020-04-21,14:44,Unnamed,Collaboration of the Democrats.
2020-04-21,14:47,Steve Mnuchin,Absolutely. Absolutely. We couldn’t have done this today without unanimous consent and the Democrats being on board and we look forward to this being passed on a bipartisan basis tomorrow. This is a real example of the country coming together to fight this virus.
2020-04-21,15:00,Unnamed,What’s your best understanding of what Mitch McConnell wants from an infrastructure?
2020-04-21,15:06,Steve Mnuchin,"Again, I think we’re not at the point of designing that. Like every other bill, we will work with senators on both sides on a bipartisan basis. I can tell you there’s a lot of support, particularly for things like broadband and especially what’s going on today. But the president has talked about… I was on the campaign with the president, we’ve been talking about bridges and tunnels and rebuilding this country for years. So the president wants to make a big investment in this."
2020-04-21,15:33,Unnamed,"This is Mitch McConnell. Mr. Secretary, what would we see the $17 billion portion of CARES reserved for company’s deemed critical for national security? And also will all companies fit into that at all per the president’s tweet?"
2020-04-21,15:49,Steve Mnuchin,So we’re in the process of putting out guidance. That part was really designed for national security companies that are either major suppliers to the Department of Defense or companies that have top secret clearance. So that national security provision was very clear when we did that. The president has asked me to work with the Secretary of Energy. Obviously the energy business is very important to us. This has national security issues but different. And we look forward to both looking at what existing capabilities we have. And that will be something we may need to go back to Congress and get additional funding for.
2020-04-21,16:29,Unnamed,Similar to the airline bailout at all or [crosstalk 00:16:33]
2020-04-21,16:32,Steve Mnuchin,"A completely different situation. What you have with the airlines is we had a very, very good airline industry. Because of the virus, they basically shut down. We have a situation now with the oil business partially because of the virus. For less demand. But partially also because of too much supply. But the president is determined we want to maintain our energy independence and the president has asked me to look at all of our options and we’re doing that. Obviously it’s a pretty extraordinary situation where you saw the front month of oil futures trade negative."
2020-04-21,17:10,Unnamed,"On the issue of the fourth stimulus bill and aid to state and local governments, any thoughts on whether that money should be proportionate to the rate of infection in states so that harder hit states-"
2020-04-21,17:23,Steve Mnuchin,"Interesting, but way too early to consider that. Whatever we do, we’ll do on a bipartisan basis. The president has listened to the governors. I’ve had the opportunity to be on multiple video conference calls with the president and the vice president. We’re reaching out to a lot of people. There’s a lot of states that have been impacted, but way too early to figure out that level of design."
2020-04-21,17:41,Unnamed,"You mentioned if a large company applies for one of these loans and they manipulate or work the system or works the loopholes to get it, what are some of the consequences if a large company tries to get one of these PPP loans, what can you do?"
2020-04-21,17:56,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, you used the word manipulate. I’m going to give people the benefit of the doubt. Again, we’re going to put up very clear guidance so that people understand what the certification is, what it means if you’re a big company. Again, there is a provision for where there are multiple affiliates that people can access this. But the intent was not for companies that have access to plenty of liquidity and other sources. And, again, if to the extent these companies didn’t understand this and they repaid the loans, that will be okay and if not, there’ll be potentially other consequences."
2020-04-21,18:31,Unnamed,Can you talk about what those consequences could be?
2020-04-21,18:33,Steve Mnuchin,"Again, you can look at the certifications there, they’re quite significant."
2020-04-21,18:40,Unnamed,Do you have an estimate of How many jobs have been saved with all of the money that’s gone out in PPP so far?
2020-04-21,18:43,Steve Mnuchin,"Well, I can tell you the PPP so far is over 30 million jobs. And again, that doesn’t account for other money that we’ve sent out. And again, we’re very pleased. The direct deposits have gone out. We’ve started sending out the checks. We’re also going to be supplementing our capability and sending prepaid debit cards so we can get money out quickly to people."
2020-04-21,19:02,Steve Mnuchin,"… prepaid debit card so we can get money out quickly to people. So everything that the President has had us working on is providing significant stability in the economy while we’re dealing with this difficult time, when, for medical reasons, we’ve closed down major parts of the economy. Thank you very much."
2020-04-21,19:15,Unnamed,That was a very nice question.
2020-04-21,19:15,Steve Mnuchin,Thank you [crosstalk 00:19:18].
2020-04-21,19:24,Donald Trump,"That was a nice question, actually. It was a good question, too. So the noble fight against the invisible enemy has inflicted a steep toll on the American workforce, as we all know. Millions of Americans sacrificed their jobs in order to battle the virus and save the lives of our fellow citizens. We have a solemn duty to ensure these unemployed Americans regain their jobs and their livelihoods."
2020-04-21,19:47,Donald Trump,"Therefore, in order to protect American workers, I will be issuing a temporary suspension of immigration into the United States. You heard about that last night. By pausing immigration, we’ll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens. So important. It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker, take care of the American worker."
2020-04-21,20:24,Donald Trump,"This pause will be in effect for 60 days, after which the need for any extension or modification will be evaluated by myself and a group of people based on economic conditions at the time. This order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency, in other words, those receiving Green Cards. Big factor. Will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis. As we move forward, we’ll examine what additional immigration-related measures should be put in place to protect US workers. We want to protect our US workers, and I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them."
2020-04-21,21:09,Donald Trump,"This pause on new immigration will also help to conserve vital medical resources for American citizens. A short break from new immigration, depending on the time we’re talking about, will protect the solvency of our healthcare system and provide relief to jobless Americans."
2020-04-21,21:29,Donald Trump,"Today, Vice President Pence visited the hardworking men and women of General Electric Healthcare in Madison, Wisconsin, who are working three shifts a day to quadruple their production of ventilators. We’re way ahead of schedule and ventilators, as you know. That’s why it’s never brought up by the media. They don’t like to bring things up when we’re doing so well. GE is also working with Ford to make 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days, more than our entire country typically produces in a very long period of time, doing that in a matter of a few weeks, in a few days."
2020-04-21,22:07,Donald Trump,"Earlier today, I had a very productive meeting with Governor Cuomo, as you probably saw, to discuss his statewide testing strategy and how we can work together to help expand it with the goal of doubling testing in the next few weeks. In New York State, we’ll be continuing to control the testing of their citizens, and we’ll also manage their state and local laboratories. They have a lot of great laboratories there, more than anybody would ever have known, frankly."
2020-04-21,22:37,Donald Trump,"The federal government will work along with the state on the national manufacturers and distributors. Together, we’ll all work together to help them secure additional tests, and we hope that this model will work with the other states as well. I think it will, for the most part. New York has a lot of very exceptional laboratories, but most of the states do. You saw the chart yesterday. Most of the states do."
2020-04-21,23:05,Donald Trump,"I’m proud of the relationship my administration has forged with New York, and I can say, very honestly, with New York State and New York City, they’ve been terrific to work with. The New York metropolitan area has been the epicenter of the outbreak here in America, and the federal government has spared no expense or resource to get New Yorkers the care they need and the care they deserve. We’ve sent over five million masks. We had five million masks, and now that number, as of about two days from now, will be more than doubled. Thousands of ventilators. In fact, so many ventilators that the governor is going to be sending up some to Massachusetts and a couple of other locations. We have a great deal of ventilators, which people thought would be impossible about a month ago. Thousands of hospital beds, and the USNS Comfort was sent, as you know, to New York. It was originally for more of a normal medical purpose, and we changed it over so that it could take care of people that had the unfortunate circumstance of going through the problem that we know so well, unfortunately, that we know so well."
2020-04-21,24:27,Donald Trump,"I said from the beginning that no American who needs a ventilator would be denied a ventilator, and we have kept that promise all over the United States. Think of that. Other countries are desperate for ventilators. They have many deaths because they don’t have a ventilator, and I’ve asked Andrew if we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we can have it for other locations. He said we would be able to do that. Javits Center has been a great help to them, but we’ll be bringing the ship back at the earliest time, and we’ll get it ready for its next mission, which I’m sure it’ll be a very important one also. But it was an honor. They reconverted it after it got there into handling an event that they were not expecting to be handling."
2020-04-21,25:19,Donald Trump,"The FDA has now authorized more than 50 diagnostic tests, including, as of late last night, the first test that a patient can take home. You can take it at home, and it’s highly accurate. LabCorp intends to make the home collection kits available to consumers in most states, with a doctor’s order, in the coming weeks. We also have four different antibody tests already authorized. Tests will help identify individuals who can donate convalescent plasma, thus providing potentially lifesaving antibodies to American patients."
2020-04-21,26:01,Donald Trump,"Dr. Hahn will be providing you with an update on these developments in a few moments. He’s done a great job at the FDA. We continue to gain ground in the war against the unseen enemy, and I see light at the end of the tunnel. I actually see a lot of light at the end of the tunnel, and we’re starting the process. We’re starting a very, very powerful, important process. You see that people are getting very anxious. They want to get going. They want to get back to their jobs. They want to make money. They want to take care of their families. So the light is getting brighter and brighter every day. With that, if I could, I’ll ask Dr. Birx to come up and then Dr. Hahn. Thank you very much."
2020-04-21,26:49,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you, Mr. President. So, looking at all of the information across the United States, we do see improvement across all the large metros. I know you know that we’ve been talking about the New York Metro Area, New York City, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Long Island, and, really, we do start to see improvement there. We see improvement even now in Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Detroit metro is doing quite well with significant declines now. New Orleans is nearly back to their baseline of where they started for new infections."
2020-04-21,27:28,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We also are seeing improvements in Chicago and Boston, and that has been a great concern for us over the last several weeks. They appear now to be flattening, both. Also, Philadelphia and Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Baltimore, Indianapolis, and St. Louis also appear to be flattening. The DC Metro Area, we don’t see a decline yet, so hopefully all of you are still social distancing and doing everything that you can."
2020-04-21,27:55,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I wanted to remind everybody of two points. When we brought up and the President put out the guidelines for opening up America, again, it was very clear to use data and to really work together to mitigate against any resurgence and also, critically, to protect the vulnerable. What we’re seeing across rural America and in some of the smaller population states is we’re still seeing outbreaks in long-term care facilities, and we asked everyone in phase one to make sure that they continued their social distancing in public to ensure that the vulnerable with co-morbidities and other conditions and among the elderly, we were staying at home and making sure we were still providing service to them."
2020-04-21,28:42,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But, as individual Americans, as we begin to open up, we also made it very clear that individual Americans need to continue all of their hygiene pieces, ensuring social distancing, washing hands, not touching their face, and making sure that they’re not bringing the virus home to vulnerable individuals within the household. Remember, those were to continue through all three phases, and so really want to call people’s attention again to the guidelines. We are continuing to see outbreaks in nursing homes and in confined spaces, and I think, as Americans, we want to stop that. We have the ability to do that by really paying attention to the guidelines that were to be in all three phases."
2020-04-21,29:25,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I’m calling on the states again to note that an informed community and knowledgeable community is a protected community. So make sure all of your states have your cases up, visible to the community so they can make decisions and understand where the virus is in their community and understand how to tackle it with their state and local governments. This will be absolutely critical, and there’s surveillance that we called for that was to find asymptomatics before people get sick, as an early warning signal. We asked for those to be in the federal clinics, in our inner city, more vulnerable areas, among indigenous populations, and, of course, in our long-term care facilities and prisons. We really want to support state and local governments to move forward on these critical monitoring to protect individuals that may be in the most critically vulnerable states."
2020-04-21,30:19,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We will continue to see mortality and deaths among our American citizens, particularly in the cities, as they begin to move past peak, because deaths will lag. So we really need to continue to unite and really, really, really support our healthcare providers, who are still on the front lines. They have been on the front lines now for weeks and weeks and weeks. So no matter what city they have been in, they have not seen the relief that we’ve been able to talk about, the light at the end of the tunnel, because of the delay in hospitalizations and deaths. So to our healthcare providers, to our respiratory therapists, and to everyone in the labs, thank you for the work that you’re doing to protect Americans and give us one of the lowest mortality rates in the entire world. Thank you."
2020-04-21,31:05,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-04-21,31:12,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to echo what Dr. Birx said. Just a few short months ago, I was one of those doctors on the front lines. I know how terrific they’re working and how well they’re doing for the American people, and a shout-out to them for just the wonderful work that they do every day."
2020-04-21,31:29,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So President Trump asked the FDA to remove all unnecessary barriers that were in place to help with the development of both diagnostics and therapeutics, and we have done that. I’m here to give you an update on FDA’s efforts around serologic tests, which, as you know, are antibody tests, which detect, in the blood, the natural immunity that someone might develop in response to infection, in this case, COVID-19. These aren’t diagnostic tests, but these are tests that actually detect the antibodies, so an indication that one has had the infection and has responded. I think it’s important for everyone to understand that the timing of the response of the antibody to the infection isn’t completely known, but we know that it takes some time to actually develop that, and there’s two types of antibody responses that can be detected. The antibody tests are just one piece of the larger response that you’ve heard in the America returning to work plan that the President, with the task force, has developed."
2020-04-21,32:27,Dr. Steven Hahn,"This pandemic is truly unprecedented in nature, and you’ll see reports around the world of different antibody tests that have been used. I think that’s a reflection of the fact that we’re just learning and beginning to understand what that response looks like, and many of these tests have different characteristics that allow to detect at different points in the infection."
2020-04-21,32:46,Dr. Steven Hahn,"I do want to address one issue that we are laser-focused on at FDA, and that is, in an effort to provide laboratories and healthcare providers the early access to tests, we issued a policy earlier in March that allowed test developers the opportunity to quickly get their tests to market and address the needs of the nation as posed by the epidemic."
2020-04-21,33:08,Dr. Steven Hahn,"In March, we provided this regulatory flexibility to manufacturers, and here’s what we required of them. The manufacturers had to validate their tests. We call it self-validation, similar to what many test developers in the world have done. They had to notify FDA that they had performed that validation, and then they had to label their products appropriately in the package insert with information about the validation, as well as the fact that it’s not a diagnostic test, that it’s an antibody test. The bottom line here is that FDA still expects manufacturers and test developers to validate their antibody tests, even under this revised policy."
2020-04-21,33:45,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Now, we’ve done a couple of things to actually help end users, to help laboratories, providers, et cetera, states, in terms of their use of these antibody tests. One is that we’re working with CDC and NCI to actually validate some of the more than 90 manufacturers who have notified us that they’ve brought their test to market to do an independent validation, and that process is going. We expect to hear more information this week about that, and we will provide that information in a transparent manner."
2020-04-21,34:14,Dr. Steven Hahn,"We also want to go after anyone who is saying that the test has been authorized or has been approved by the FDA, but actually hasn’t. We’ve authorized four applications for antibody tests, and 140 test developers are pursuing applications for us as we speak. So it’s not okay for someone to say that a test has been authorized or approved by FDA when it hasn’t, and we are pursuing them, both by direct contact with the manufacturers, but also at the border."
2020-04-21,34:45,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So we have increased these interdiction efforts, and we will continue to outreach and do that with the manufacturers to make sure that we provide the most up-to-date information to the end users of these products. We will continue to make all of our efforts, both in the diagnostics and the therapeutics, to help America open up again. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-21,35:03,Donald Trump,Thank you.
2020-04-21,35:06,Unnamed (Reporter),Dr. Hahn?
2020-04-21,35:07,Donald Trump,"Please, go ahead."
2020-04-21,35:07,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Hahn, you’re speaking of 140 different developers, more than 90 manufacturers. How many of these tests actually work?"
2020-04-21,35:13,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So, as I mentioned, the 90 that have come forward inside their market in the US, they are required by us to have self-validation, and they’re required to label that appropriately in their package insert. They also said that what we’re doing is we’re working with folks around the country, but here at home, with US government, with the NCI and CDC to validate some of those tests that have come forward to us. So we’re actually doing some independent validation."
2020-04-21,35:39,Unnamed (Reporter),What have you found so far?
2020-04-21,35:40,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So we don’t have those results yet. I expect to have more results this week, but we will be transparent about those results, because we think it’s very important. Your question is superb in that if someone wants to use a test that’s come to market, really, it’s important to read the information that’s in the package insert, but often, in some of those cases, it’s also important for the independent labs to do the validation, also. You may have seen reports in the press of labs around the country that have done that. We’ve actually reached out to them, many academics, and we will be including that information in the information that we generate as well to provide to the American people."
2020-04-21,36:12,Unnamed (Reporter),"Dr. Hahn [crosstalk 00:36:15]. While we have you here, there was a study out of the VA today on hydroxychloroquine that found a higher mortality rate compared to those who got standard of care. I know this isn’t a large-scale clinical trial, but since this drug is out there and people are using it, can you give some takeaways from that study? Did that change your thinking at all on the hydroxychloroquine?"
2020-04-21,36:35,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So this study is a small retrospective study at the VA, and similar to the data we talked about before, with the French study, this is something that a doctor would need to consider as part of the decision in writing a prescription for hydroxychloroquine. As I’ve mentioned from this podium and in other venues before, what FDA is going to require is data from clinical trials, randomized clinical trials, hydroxychloroquine, placebo to actually make a definitive decision around safety and efficacy."
2020-04-21,37:03,Dr. Steven Hahn,"But the preliminary data are helpful to providers and doctors. I want to ask them to incorporate the data as we have it come forward, and it’s not definitive data. It doesn’t help us make a decision, from a regulatory point of view. But doctors should incorporate that in the decision-making they make on a one-on-one basis."
2020-04-21,37:20,Unnamed (Reporter),Just the timeline on the clinical trials and when we will be getting a read-out of that data?
2020-04-21,37:24,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So the good news is we have over 30 clinical trials. Now, the settings are very different. They’re in the outpatient setting, they’re in the inpatient setting, and also, I think very importantly, in what we call the postexposure prophylaxis, meaning if you’re a healthcare worker or a frontline provider and you’ve been exposed to the virus, take the drug for a period of time to see if you can prevent the development of illness related to the virus. So all those trials are in progress, and it will probably be early summer before we get a read-out."
2020-04-21,37:49,Unnamed (Reporter),"Mr. President, [inaudible 00:37:51] that."
2020-04-21,37:52,Donald Trump,"All of these tests, I want to say, are in addition to the tests that we already have. We have tested more people than anybody anywhere in the world by far, by very far."
2020-04-21,38:03,Unnamed (Reporter),Mr. President …
2020-04-21,38:03,Donald Trump,"Anybody, anywhere in the world by far, by very far."
2020-04-21,38:03,Bret Baier,"Mr. President, [crosstalk 00:00:04], well I think you wanted to follow up on the hydroxychloroquine. I’m wondering if you’re concerned this VA study showed that actually more people died that used the drug that didn’t, and I’m wondering if Governor Cuomo brought you back any results."
2020-04-21,38:20,Donald Trump,"No, didn’t discuss it, and I don’t know of the report. Obviously there have been some very good reports and perhaps this one’s not a good report, but we’ll be looking at it. We’ll have a comment at some point."
2020-04-21,38:30,Bret Baier,A panel of experts at the NIH is actually now recommending against the use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with Z-Pak which is something you’ve recommended.
2020-04-21,38:39,Donald Trump,"Okay, well, we’ll take a look at that. I’m always willing to take a look. Brett."
2020-04-21,38:42,Unnamed,Another subject. Your signing of the executive order. When do you plan to do that?
2020-04-21,38:46,Donald Trump,"The executive order will be… It’s being written now as we speak, probably tomorrow sometime."
2020-04-21,38:51,Unnamed,"So, will it have exemptions in there?"
2020-04-21,38:54,Donald Trump,"It will have certain exemptions because you’re going to need certain exemptions, but we’ll be notifying you tomorrow. We’ll sign it most likely tomorrow, being drawn now and tonight, and it’s something we have to have in this country. We have to have it."
2020-04-21,39:08,Unnamed,"So, for the people who say it doesn’t track with opening up the country to shut down immigration across the board for companies and the pipeline that’s already in place, what do you say to them?"
2020-04-21,39:19,Donald Trump,"Well, I think it really does. I think it’s very strong, obviously, and it’s countrywide as opposed to specifically like China, or some of the other ones that I’ve shut down. We’re going to see and you’ll see a very accurate definition tomorrow after it’s completed by the attorneys."
2020-04-21,39:33,Unnamed,"Last thing for me. North Korea, what can you tell us about the status of Kim Jong Un?"
2020-04-21,39:39,Donald Trump,"Well, these are reports that came out and we don’t know. We don’t know. I’ve had a very good relationship with him. I can only say this. I wish him well, because if he is in the kind of condition that the reports say, that the news is saying, that’s a very serious condition as you know. But I wish him well. We’ve had a good relationship. I’ve said it and I’ve said it many times. If somebody else were in this position, we would have been right now at war with North Korea, and we’re not at war and we’re nowhere close to war with North Korea. So I just have to say to Kim Jong Un, and I wish him very good luck. Good luck. I mean, they came out with very, very serious medical reports. Nobody’s confirmed that. It was CNN that came out. So when CNN comes out with a report, I don’t place too much credence in it."
2020-04-21,40:34,Unnamed,Your meeting today with Governor Cuomo. Did he convince you of a need for expanded testing [crosstalk 00:40:40]-
2020-04-21,40:40,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we had a great talk on testing, and we have an agreement, we have an understanding on testing, and they have labs, tremendous labs, as you know, in New York, especially in the Manhattan area, but all over the state, and great, great medical schools and federal labs. So we have a very good understanding. We’re going to do very significant testing. You know, not everybody wants to do such significant testing. Testing is good in some cases and in some cases it’s not. You have governors that don’t want to go all out in the testing because they think they can do it in a different manner and do it better. But we had a very good meeting today. The Governor and I had a very good meeting."
2020-04-21,41:21,Unnamed,Is there more federal aid that can be used to help governors who want to expand testing because we keep hearing that all they [crosstalk 00:41:27]-
2020-04-21,41:26,Donald Trump,"We have $25 billion, and that’s a tremendous amount of money. That’s much far more money than, in my opinion, that we’ll need. And again, already we’re testing more by far than any country. I think I read yesterday a report that we’ve done more than everybody else, every other country combined, and I think our people should be getting a lot of credit for that. We’ve done a lot more than everybody else combined, and you never hear that in the news. It’s unfortunate. Yeah, please."
2020-04-21,41:55,Unnamed,"Mr. President, just back on the executive order for a second. You mentioned that they’re going to be some exemptions. We’re reporting right now that it only applies to green cards for employment but not for those for [crosstalk 00:04:07]-"
2020-04-21,42:08,Donald Trump,We’re going to be reporting on that later on. It might be tonight or tomorrow. We’ll give you an exact report.
2020-04-21,42:12,Unnamed,What can you say to people who may be worried about the ability to bring immediate family members into [crosstalk 00:42:17]-
2020-04-21,42:17,Donald Trump,"No, I think it’s been covered pretty accurately in this case. I think most people know what it is and some people will be able to get in. We have to do that, obviously even from a humane standpoint, but there’ll be some people coming in, but it’s a strong order. It involves a big circle as you know. Please."
2020-04-21,42:37,Unnamed,"Are immigrants who are already in the country, are they at greater risk of deportation based on this order?"
2020-04-21,42:43,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t think so. They’re not supposed to be here. You’re saying they’re here illegally. Is that what you’re saying?"
2020-04-21,42:48,Unnamed,"Well, for example, if an immigrant is here for a court order, right? Are they at risk of deportation?"
2020-04-21,42:54,Donald Trump,"Well, if a court order, then you have to go to court. So then the judge would make a determination as to whether or not they’re going to be staying, but if they have a court order, they won’t have to leave until they go through that process. So we’ll see what happens. But with the court, and there are some with court orders, that means they have a trial coming up. Please."
2020-04-21,43:09,Unnamed,"Yes. So obviously on the immigration executive order, you’ve raised concern for a long time, even in good economic times, about immigrants taking Americans’ jobs. So under what conditions would you consider lifting this halt on immigration [crosstalk 00:05:25], or is this sort of an opportunity to address what you’ve seen as a problem for a long time?"
2020-04-21,43:30,Donald Trump,"Well, I think, look, right now, obviously there’s never been. We had the greatest economy in the world, and then one day we had to shut it down. They said you have to shut it down. We did the right thing because I think we would’ve had a million, or maybe even two million or maybe more than that, deaths. So we did the right thing. But certainly this would pertain, I mean when you look at it, right now the last thing we want to do is take American workers’ jobs. It’s one thing when we were essentially, they used to call it full employment, and it’s another thing right now. Right now we have people that have lost their jobs and we hope they’re going to come back and come back fast, and then we can have an even deeper discussion. But right now we have to have jobs for Americans."
2020-04-21,44:09,Unnamed,"But, do you have any sense of like if unemployment gets to 4% or 5% [crosstalk 00:44:14]-"
2020-04-21,44:13,Donald Trump,"Well, we’ll have to see. I mean, I hope we’re in that position to have that debate. Right now, we’re not in that position. Right now, we’ve closed down the largest economy, the greatest economy in the history of the world. It’s the most successful economy. When you look at the stock market, we’re breaking records virtually every week, sometimes every day. And the stock market’s still not doing badly considering what this country has been through, which tells you how strong it was in the first place, but no, I hope we’re going to be able to have that discussion. I hope we’re in a position. That’s like a good discussion to have, but that’ll be a little bit later. Brett."
2020-04-21,44:50,Bret Baier,"Another question for Dr. Birx, about the CDC director said in an interview that perhaps this second wave of the coronavirus in the fall could be worse because it is timed with the seasonal flu. Just wondering if you could talk about that in context of as you’re opening up the country and these guidelines that you’ve laid out."
2020-04-21,45:09,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Yeah, so we were very clear in the guidelines that we believe we can monitor, again, monitor communities at the community level by using the influenza like illness, and the syndromic respiratory and gastrointestinal components of this particular virus. Obviously when we have flu, and we’re working on an algorithm that you test for flu and then you test for COVID, and making sure that we are building the testing capacity to be able to do that, because I think it’s very important that you’re going to be able… On the surface, a patient when they come in with early flu and early COVID can look very close to identical, so we need to have testing in place to be able to separate and ensure those patients receive the best treatment. We’re also hoping by that time that we have additional treatment options for people with COVID-19 so that there will be additional treatment available in the fall."
2020-04-21,46:08,Bret Baier,But your message would be to prepare for that time thinking that it will come back together.
2020-04-21,46:13,Dr. Deborah Birx,"The President has made it clear that we have the emergency, which we have been working on, the opening up guidelines and just like he talks about phase four, he has us very much working on the next 60, 90, and for all on with fall, and that’s why he’s not stopped any of the ventilator orders. It’s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall, and I think that’s why we’ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States but certainly if other partner countries have this level of tragedy. [crosstalk 00:46:51]"
2020-04-21,46:54,Unnamed,"Follow up on that, so you agree this could come back actually worse in the fall?"
2020-04-21,46:58,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I don’t know if it will be worse. I think this has been pretty bad. When you see what has happened in New York, that was very bad. I believe that we’ll have early warning signals both from our surveillance that we’ve been talking about on the vulnerable populations. We’re going to continue that surveillance from now all the way through the fall to be able to give us that early warning signal. I think what we’ve learned is how good Americans are about immediately reverting to all of those issues that they need to do in order to ensure that they’re protected and their families."
2020-04-21,47:33,Unnamed,"And Mr. President, what do you say to the concerns like Georgia is opening up barber shops and bowling alleys and the like, and you saw Lindsey Graham is saying he’s concerned that Georgia may be going too far too fast and it could affect people in South Carolina. Obviously people travel back and forth between states. How do you protect the people of South Carolina for example, from a potentially bad decision by a governor in Georgia?"
2020-04-21,47:57,Donald Trump,"So he’s a very capable man. He knows what he’s doing. He’s done a very good job as Governor, Georgia, and by the way, and South Carolina, Governor McMaster also. So you have two very capable people we’re going to find out. And in fact I’m scheduled to speak to the Governor of Georgia in a little while, but we’ll find out."
2020-04-21,48:18,Unnamed,What about Lindsey Graham’s concern that what happens in Georgia can affect South Carolina?
2020-04-21,48:19,Donald Trump,"Well, everybody, I have a concern about what happens everywhere. I mean we’ve got those concerns. And as far as coming back, if they do come back and they could come back together with heavy on the flu and much lighter on, because I really believe we’ll be able to put out the fires, you know, it’s like fires. And we’ve learned a lot, you know, we’ve become very good at this. When you look at what’s happening, when you look at the numbers coming down, a lot of states are in really great shape. You’re going to see a lot of openings. But I’ll be speaking to the Governor of Georgia in a little while."
2020-04-21,48:47,Unnamed,"Mr. President, do the American people need to be prepared for going back to social distancing even if things lax over summer come to fall, if the virus comes back [crosstalk 00:49:00]-"
2020-04-21,49:00,Donald Trump,"Well, I can see them and I’ll speak for the doctor, and if you’d like either of you to say, but I would say that you keep away until this thing is gone. It’s going to be gone at some point. It’s going to be gone gone, and I would say you keep away and you do the social distancing until such time as you know it’s gone. We’ll know when that time is."
2020-04-21,49:18,Unnamed,Your executive order is to last for 60 days. How will you decide whether to extend it? [crosstalk 00:49:23]
2020-04-21,49:23,Donald Trump,"Well, I look at the economy. We’ll see where we are with the economy basically, and I think I’ll have a very easy decision to make. I hope that the economy is going to be great by that time, but we’ll see. But right now in light of the fact that Americans are out of jobs, I can’t be taken in."
2020-04-21,49:41,Unnamed,Will you roll it for another 60 days or-
2020-04-21,49:43,Donald Trump,"Well, I could, or I could roll it for 30 days, or I could roll it for much more than 60 days. We’ll have to take a look at the time, but we’ll be looking at 60 days and we’ll see what it is. Yeah, in the back. [crosstalk 00:49:51] I’m sorry, why don’t you go and then you."
2020-04-21,49:53,Unnamed,"Okay, on the immigration order [inaudible 00:11:59], there was reporting that you may actually sign a second order to even limit more those extensions that you were just talking about. Can you confirm that you are considering?"
2020-04-21,50:08,Donald Trump,"It could happen if I want, but I won’t be doing it tomorrow. I’ll be signing the primary order and then we have a secondary order that if I want to do that, we’ll make that determination. We can do that. Yeah, we can do that at a little bit different time if we want,"
2020-04-21,50:20,Unnamed,But that is under consideration of discussing a second order?
2020-04-21,50:22,Donald Trump,"Yeah, sure, sure, secondary orders, yeah, please."
2020-04-21,50:25,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. One from me and one from a reporter who couldn’t be in the room because of social distancing. [crosstalk 00:50:31] So, my first question is about your immigration order. You campaigned on reducing legal immigration. I remember your speech in Phoenix in 2016 on reducing legal immigration."
2020-04-21,50:45,Donald Trump,"Okay, but legal and illegal. But no, I’ve always said you have to come into the country legally. So not legal. What I campaigned on was people just flooding our border and stopping. And by the way, speaking of that, we have 170 miles, almost 170 miles of a very powerful border wall up, and it’s moving rapidly, very quickly, and it’s having a tremendous impact, and it’s making our job a lot easier. Plus, Mexico has 27,000 soldiers right now on our southern border that we share with them and Mexico has been terrific. They’ve really helped."
2020-04-21,51:17,Unnamed,"You also campaigned on reducing legal immigration, and I’m wondering if some critics are saying that you are using the virus now in this crisis to follow through on that promise to reduce legal immigration."
2020-04-21,51:30,Donald Trump,"No. No. Well, I want people that are in this country, I want our citizens to get jobs. I don’t want them to have competition. We have a very unusual situation where something came in that nobody has seen for many, many decades, probably 1917 would be the closest analogy. If you look at it, when you look at the contagion, the kind of contagion we’re talking about. So no, I’m not doing that at all. I want the American worker and the American citizens to be able to get jobs. I don’t want them to compete right now. There’s a big difference when we have a full economy and frankly where some of the companies, we have many companies moving in, where they need actually, they need workers. That’s a big difference between that and where all of a sudden a lot of people lose jobs."
2020-04-21,52:16,Unnamed,"As you know, a lot of farmers rely on seasonal migrant workers [crosstalk 00:52:19]."
2020-04-21,52:19,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s not going to be affected. That’s an important point. [crosstalk 00:52:21] The farmers will not be affected. Yeah, that’s very important point. I mean, it’s a great point actually. I’m glad you brought it up. No, the farmers will not be affected. [crosstalk 00:52:33] They’ve had cases where they stopped everybody from coming in and all the farmers went out of business. They were literally out of business. You remember that, Brett, it was not so long ago. It’s easy, you know, it’s easier to stop everything cold than it is to plan it so that the farmers have the people that have been working in those farms for many years, and that’s what we’re doing. No, the farmers will not be affected by this at all. If anything, we’re going to make it easier, and we’re doing a process that’ll make it better for those workers to come in to go to the farm where they’ve been for a long time."
2020-04-21,53:04,Unnamed,"Now, for a question from our reporter who is out of the room is from the Washington Times, Tom Howell. Why hasn’t the CDC, the federal government’s main disease fighting agency, had a more public facing role amid the pandemic if it was holding regular media calls early on but has not held one since early to mid-March?"
2020-04-21,53:22,Donald Trump,"Well, I can tell you that the CDC has been terrific. We’ve worked with them very closely. They were very much involved, even in the border decision that I made last night, and the Director’s doing a good job, and we have always, whether it’s Tony or Deborah or Steve, we have always a lot of people up, and certainly as you’ve seen, the Director has been here a lot. Right? He’s been here, has been sitting here. He’s been speaking a lot. No, no, CDC is very much involved in everything we’ve done. [crosstalk 00:53:55]"
2020-04-21,53:57,Unnamed,The Director of the CDC said the protests against stay at home orders are not helpful. You’ve encouraged some of these protests. What are your thoughts on the CDC Director saying that these protests are not a good idea?
2020-04-21,54:07,Donald Trump,"Well, people, look, it’s not a question of helpful or not, people want to get back to work and I’ve watched some of the protests, not in great detail, but I seen that, and they’re separated, they’re a lot of space in between. I mean, they’re watching, believe it or not. They’re doing social distancing if you can believe it, and they are, and they’re protesting, but the groups I’ve seen have been very much spread out, so I think that’s good. Look, people, they want to get back to work. They got to make a living. They have to take care of their family. They don’t want to do this. It’s unfortunate maybe one way or the other. Both are unfortunate. Both are unfortunate, but you have a lot of people out there that are anxious to get back. Yeah, please."
2020-04-21,54:49,Unnamed,"[inaudible 00:54:49] seem to be indicating that people are actually more concerned, more people are concerned about the virus spread and they don’t want to go out. They don’t want to go to work. They don’t want to go outside."
2020-04-21,54:57,Donald Trump,"They’re two groups. They’re big groups, both of them."
2020-04-21,55:01,Unnamed,"So my questions is, what good is it for these businesses that would reopen if the customers are afraid to go outside?"
2020-04-21,55:06,Donald Trump,"Well, at the same time, we have to build back our country, and I’m going to make our country bigger and better and stronger, and we have to get started. There’s a big difference though because people have really been through a lot, and they understand what to do now. Before, nobody had ever heard of a thing like this. Wouldn’t you say? I mean, nobody ever heard of a thing like this distancing, social distancing. What does that mean? Washing your hands every 15 minutes. What does that mean? I mean, people had never seen or heard about anything like this. Now they really are. Not only have they done it, but they’ve done a good job of it. But you have people, you can’t break the country."
2020-04-21,55:43,Donald Trump,"At some point you have to go back. Now hopefully the governors are going to do, because I want the governors, and I’ve always wanted that. You could call it federalism. You can call it whatever you want, but the governors, I want them to do it. If we see them doing something we don’t like, we’ll stop it very quickly, but they’re doing a good job. They’re being careful. Some of the governors, frankly, they’re in a position where they can do it sooner or they can do a little bit later and that’s okay, but people, they need money. They need help, and we can’t break our country over this. We can’t do it. We have to get going. With that being said, some are going to go soon and some are not. Yeah, in the back please."
2020-04-21,56:25,Unnamed,"If I might just, pardon me, hair salons, nail salons, tattoo parlors. Dr. Birx, can you weigh in on this because the people of Atlanta want to hear from you as well, as much as they want to hear from their Governor."
2020-04-21,56:37,Donald Trump,"Yeah, I think you can respond."
2020-04-21,56:39,Unnamed,How do you safely have hair salons and nail salons and tattoo parlors where people-
2020-04-21,56:47,Donald Trump,Where is it at?
2020-04-21,56:48,Unnamed,"This is in Georgia, where people have to inherently be close together."
2020-04-21,56:50,Dr. Deborah Birx,"I think what I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several days, is it’s really important that the governors and mayors communicate critical information to their communities and show very clearly the data. We remember we wanted this data-"
2020-04-21,57:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"… show very clearly the data. Remember, we wanted this data in evidence-based, the data that they utilize to make decisions and the data that the mayor’s should use in each of the communities because it will have to be on a community by community opening because there are different communities in different places, even in Georgia. So I believe people in Atlanta would understand that if their cases are not going down, that they need to continue to do everything that we said. Social distancing, washing your hands, wearing a mask in public. So if there’s a way that people can social distance and do those things, then they can do those things. I don’t know how, but people are very creative."
2020-04-21,57:46,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So I’m not going to prejudge but we have told people very clearly and the president guidelines made it very clear about the expectations of phase one. Remember phase one also included social distancing in restaurants, social distancing in every place that was entertainment and keeping your own individual social groups to less than 10. And we’ve been very clear in the guidelines and I think it’s up to the governors and mayors to ensure that they’re following the best they can each of those phases to make sure that both the public is completely protected. But the governors and mayors also need to communicate very clearly on the data that was used for decision making and make that transparent and available to their community."
2020-04-21,58:33,Donald Trump,"As an example that you just gave, are they doing testing before they go in? We have to find that out. That’s why I’m speaking to the governor a little while and I’ll be asking him those questions. Please."
2020-04-21,58:42,Unnamed,"Thank you Mr. President. Just to try to get a sense of what you have left in the toolbox as it relates to oil. You hashed out to deal with OPEC Plus, you’ve ordered for purchases into the SPR. I mean what else can be done?"
2020-04-21,58:54,Donald Trump,"Well, the biggest thing in the toolbox is to get our country open. That’s by far the biggest thing there is. If we can open pretty well, and I think we’re going to over a period of time, piece by piece puzzle, remember. If we can open well, I think that’s your biggest part by far. That’s where the engine is more important than any other thing that we can work on. Please."
2020-04-21,59:17,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Two New York related questions. In your meeting with Governor Cuomo, was there talk about providing states like New York with aid in the fourth stimulus package? I’m wondering if you have any thoughts on whether that aid should be tied to infection rates. Whether states like New York, New Jersey that have been hardest hit should receive more money and also wondering if you have any thoughts on Mayor Bill de Blasio saying today that he’d like to host a ticker tape parade of sorts once this is all over to honor the healthcare workers [inaudible 00:59:49]."
2020-04-21,59:50,Donald Trump,"Frankly, that sounds like a good idea to me when it’s all over. It sounds like a great idea. They deserve it. They’re warriors. They’ve done an incredible job. We mentioned briefly the state aid. We talked about that, Governor Cuomo and myself and I agree with him on that and I think most Republicans agree too and Democrats and that’s part of phase four and I think infrastructure is going to be a big part. We have to rebuild our country."
2020-04-21,01:00:13,Donald Trump,"I mean you take a look where we spend and we go over this all the time, but $8 trillion in the Middle East. We want to rebuild our country and that means our bridges, our tunnels, even schools. We’re doing something with schools. We have to do our roadways. What’s happened, we spent so much money on other countries that don’t even, they don’t appreciate it. Okay? They don’t’ appreciate it. We’re going to spend money now on our country and we’re going to have… it’s going to be our jobs and it’s going to be our equipment. Much of it is going to be made here. Hopefully at some point, all of it’s going to be made here. John."
2020-04-21,01:00:49,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, at that podium back on March 9th, Vice President Pence said that over a million tests had been distributed and then he said, and this is an exact quote, “Before the end of this week, another 4 million tests will be distributed.” As you know now, six weeks later, we still aren’t at 4 million tests. What went wrong with the testing?"
2020-04-21,01:01:11,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:01:11] Ready? Are you ready? Again, I’ll say it for the fifth time, we have tested more than any country in the world and some of the countries are very big. Okay, more than any country in the world. We have one of the most successful if you call mortality rates because one person, and I always say that for you in particular, one person is too many. But we’ve done very well our testing. If you add them all up, we’ve tested more. Now, I don’t know what Mike Pence said, but I’m sure he could answer that question."
2020-04-21,01:01:44,John (Reporter),He said 4 million tests and we’re six months later we’re not at that point.
2020-04-21,01:01:47,Donald Trump,"Are ready again? We’ve tested more than every country in the world even put together. So that’s all I can say. As far as Mike, he’ll answer your question when he’s here. He’ll be back tomorrow."
2020-04-21,01:01:59,Unnamed,I just want to go back to the China deal and the phase one of this China deal. The flight ban is still in place. How confident are you that the Chinese are not going to invoke the natural disaster clause to just wait before getting into there?
2020-04-21,01:02:17,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to see. Look, there’s nobody ever been tougher on China than me and that means for 20 years. You go back 20 years. I probably got elected at least partially on the fact that I’ve been very tough. I said China has been ripping us off for years. I’d go into Michigan, I’d go into Pennsylvania, make speeches unrelated to being a politician. I’d be invited. I’d be speaking to people, which I like to do because I love the people. I love the people of this country and I’d make speeches. Nobody. I say, how did you let this happen with China? I even asked the leaders of China how did this ever happen where our country loses tens of billions of dollars a year? And I don’t mean just tens. Take a look, 200 billion, 300 billion, 400 billion, $500 billion a year. How did they ever let a thing like this happen?"
2020-04-21,01:03:11,Donald Trump,"Now, if you look at this last year, the deficit went way down and I’m talking about even before, now it’s much different, but a lot of things are happening. Great things were happening except all of a sudden out of nowhere came the invisible enemy and we think we know where it came from and we’ll be talking about that probably a lot, but came the invisible enemy. There’s been nobody tougher than me on China."
2020-04-21,01:03:38,Unnamed,You have no guarantee that they are going to go ahead with this phase one.
2020-04-21,01:03:41,Donald Trump,"But if that happens we’ll do a termination and we’ll do what I can do better than anybody. Yeah, please."
2020-04-21,01:03:47,Unnamed,"[inaudible 01:03:47] about China. Has US intelligence analysts told you that they think that the virus escaped from a Chinese research lab, that it was an [crosstalk 01:03:57]?"
2020-04-21,01:03:58,Donald Trump,"Well, I can’t tell you that. Have US intelligence agents told me, I mean, what kind of a question is that?"
2020-04-21,01:04:01,Unnamed,Do you feel at all [crosstalk 01:04:03]?
2020-04-21,01:04:01,Donald Trump,"Do you want me to tell you? Oh, let me tell you what they told me. Look, they told me plenty. They told me plenty. Bret."
2020-04-21,01:04:09,Bret Baier,I wanted to follow up on what you said about the small business program. Harvard’s going to pay the money back. How confident are you that you can pull back money for [crosstalk 01:04:17]?
2020-04-21,01:04:17,Donald Trump,"Look, I don’t like when Harvard that has I think a $40 billion endowment or some incredible amount of money that Harvard gets this money. Harvard should pay that money back. I want Harvard to pay the money back. Okay? If they won’t do that, then we will do something else. They have to pay it back. I don’t like it. I don’t like it. This is meant for workers. This isn’t meant for one of the richest institutions, not only far beyond schools in the world. They’ve got to pay it back. I want them to pay it back. Yeah."
2020-04-21,01:04:48,Unnamed,"Mr. President, your Florida clubs have had to furlough workers."
2020-04-21,01:04:54,Donald Trump,"Yeah, it’s true."
2020-04-21,01:04:55,Unnamed,Have you thought about asking your family members to maybe keep some of the workers on the payroll [ inaudible 00:01:05:01]?
2020-04-21,01:05:03,Donald Trump,"Well, in Doral you’re not allowed to have the golf courses open, you can’t have the clubs open, you can’t have anything. It’s a big hotel and resort and I think there’s probably 700, 750 people so you can’t have anything open. And you say, “What are we going to do, have full pay roll and have the whole place with,” there’s no income coming in. First of all, everyone’s home and they’re supposed to be. Second of all, Florida you can’t use golf courses. That one I’m not sure I agree with you. You have parks and golf courses where you have open space, but that’s what it is. So I have others also. Then I have others in different states. I have a lot of different properties. But again, my children run them and I love my children and I wish them well. I look forward to comparing my numbers to my children’s numbers. I think I’ll do better."
2020-04-21,01:05:59,Unnamed,You haven’t thought about asking her if [inaudible 00:09:00].
2020-04-21,01:06:02,Donald Trump,"Property is like, you have to close them up and then hopefully when things get better we’ll just open it up. But you can’t have many hundreds of employees standing around doing nothing. There’s no customer. You’re not allowed to have a customer. So in some places it’s very strict. New Jersey’s strict. New York is strict and you have to do what you have to do and it’s too bad. I feel so badly when I say that. I think that it’s a tough policy, but I go by whatever the policy. That’s a state policy in the case of Florida."
2020-04-21,01:06:42,Unnamed,You’ve communicated regularly with Kim Jong Un the North Korean leader. Are you going to try to reach out to him to check on his condition?
2020-04-21,01:06:48,Donald Trump,"Look, I just hope he’s doing fine. I mean, I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un, and that’s to the benefit of the country. That’s not a bad thing. That’s a good thing. And I’d like to see him be well and we’ll see how he does. Again, I don’t know that the reports are true."
2020-04-21,01:07:03,Unnamed,Do they have a line of succession as far as you know?
2020-04-21,01:07:06,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to ask them that. I have asked him that, but it’s my purpose to tell you that in all fairness. But I hope he does well. Please."
2020-04-21,01:07:18,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:07:18] follow up with Dr. Birx for a moment. Dr Birx if you don’t mind, I just wanted to follow up on the question we were asking you about with social distance in some of these states. So with Georgia opening back up, things like tattoo parlors, getting a massage, social distancing maybe there are some creative ways, but it seems very difficult to do social distancing. So do you have a message for people in Georgia who are soon going to have a choice about going to the hair salon or the nail salon or getting that tattoo if they’re not six feet apart and they’re not able to follow these social distancing guidelines? What’s your message to people in a state like Georgia?"
2020-04-21,01:07:56,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, we made it very clear in a message to all of the American people with Opening up America Again the criteria that we wanted states to follow. Those were careful criteria. There were only six. They were carefully, carefully selected in conversations with epidemiologists around the world and with CDC to really pick things that people could understand and use platforms that people have utilized in the past. But it was built on the premise that it needs to be data-driven and it needs to protect those who are most vulnerable. And then it went through the phases and the very first thing it says in all phases, all individuals need to continue to wash hands, protect the vulnerable, ensure the safety of others. But in phase one it made it clear that social distancing was absolutely key and I think it’s on the White House website and we ask every American to read it and do use that as their guidelines."
2020-04-21,01:08:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,Now we’ve also asked governors to create county level information so that communities can see the information and understand why they may be different than a different county so that it’s very transparent and understandable. I had a question here a couple of days ago on a Jacksonville beach and Jacksonville is dramatically different than Miami and I think that was reflected in why Jacksonville had a different set of information and regulations. So I’m not going to second judge anyone about their decision making. What I’m going to say is we were very clear in what we really believe protects the safety of Americans and that is clearly laid out in the Opening up America Again.
2020-04-21,01:09:44,Unnamed,"I have a question because we got data from Tokyo, an increase of cases and a double of the cases in Singapore. We’ve been looking a lot at Europe after China and then we’re back into this area of the world. Here we’re talking about a plateau and then cases going up. Any lessons to take out of what’s happening in this area in Asia after [inaudible 01:10:11] been put our attention somewhere else first of all?"
2020-04-21,01:10:15,Donald Trump,"The lesson is to be careful. We’ve got to be very careful. We don’t want that to happen. It could happen. I think we’d stamp it out if it does happen. We’re not going to be doing any mass closings I hope, so I think we could. I’d call them some burning embers and we put them out and I think we’ve gotten very good at that. But we’ll see. But we don’t want that to happen. No, absolutely."
2020-04-21,01:10:39,Unnamed,"Are you concerned Mr. President, once the reopening happen, we won’t need to go back into reclosing?"
2020-04-21,01:10:46,Donald Trump,"I don’t want to do that. You don’t want to do that. Nobody in this room wants to do that. You look forward, I think Bret, very soon, and John sitting next to a lot of your fellow reporters, right? The room seems so empty this way, but it’s one of those things. Yeah. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-21,01:11:02,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you. On the topic of public support for your immigration treaties, an Ipsos USA Today poll just came out and found 80% of Americans are supportive of the immigration halt, the temporary freeze."
2020-04-21,01:11:17,Donald Trump,"Yes, I know that."
2020-04-21,01:11:19,Unnamed,Did public support have any effect on your decision making here and are you surprised by those numbers?
2020-04-21,01:11:25,Donald Trump,"Yeah, it’s a high number. I did not see that number. I heard there was a poll. I’m sure there’ll be a lot of polls. No, look, I think the American people want to make sure that they have jobs for the American people, not for people that come in, in many cases illegally into our country, so we’re doing that. I don’t know what the numbers are, but I think just common sense tells you that’s where we should be and that’s where the American people want to be and we’re going to build our country back."
2020-04-21,01:11:51,Donald Trump,"And I’m telling you with all of the things that we’re doing and infrastructure which we desperately need, it’s going to be an incredible thing taking place. I think it’s going to be a renaissance and we’re going to have something that will be a lot of people are going to go to work building those roads and bridges and tunnels and highways and all of the other things we’re going to be building and broadband for the Middle West. I mean the farmers haven’t been treated fairly. Let’s face it, the farmers have been treated terribly when it comes to the internet, so we’re going to take care of that. We’re going to make them very happy."
2020-04-21,01:12:22,Donald Trump,"So we’ll see you all tomorrow and we’ll have some interesting things to put out tonight and I appreciate you being here and it’s an honor to have Bret Baier here. I’ve used his slot a lot, John. I’ve used that slot a lot."
2020-04-21,01:12:33,Bret Baier,[crosstalk 01:12:33] Mr. President.
2020-04-21,01:12:36,Donald Trump,We want to have your back soon. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody.
2020-04-22,00:00,Donald Trump,(silence).
2020-04-22,02:06,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
2020-04-22,02:12,Donald Trump,"A lot of tremendous things are happening. The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide. Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing. The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what’s going on and they’re going down, they’re going in the right direction. Cases in the Boston area now declining. The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific, and Detroit is past its peak. These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen. It’s very exciting. It was very exciting even today, watching and seeing what’s happening and people are getting ready and they’re all excited."
2020-04-22,03:01,Donald Trump,"I do want to mention a man who’s done a very good job for us. Dr. Robert Redfield was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus, totally misquoted. I spoke to him and he said it was ridiculous. He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time and corona could be just some little flare ups that we’ll take care of. We’re going to knock it out. We’ll knock it out fast. But that’s what he was referring to, coming together at the same time. And I think rather than waiting, I’d ask Dr. Redfield to come up and say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn’t say it was a big explosion."
2020-04-22,03:44,Donald Trump,"The headline in The Washington Post was totally inaccurate. The statement wasn’t bad in the post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is, as I say, that’s fake news and CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew. They were asked to change it and they wouldn’t do that and it was a fall. So I’ll ask Dr. Redfield who is a real professional to come up and explain. Please. Thank you, Doc."
2020-04-22,04:16,Dr. Redfield,"Thank you Mr. President. I really do think it’s important to clarify this as we build the confidence of the American people. When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility that the next fall and winter could be more difficult, more complicated. When we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time, influenza and the coronavirus-19, but I think it’s really important to emphasize what I didn’t say. I didn’t say that this was going to be worse. I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated, because we’ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time."
2020-04-22,04:59,Dr. Redfield,"I want to emphasize that we continue to build the nation’s public health infrastructure to ensure that we have the capacity to stay in the containment mode. Those of you who heard me talk before, I’ve told you that in January and February, up to February 27, 28, this nation had 14 cases. We were in the containment mode. And then unfortunately, the virus overwhelmed where we got into extreme mitigation."
2020-04-22,05:23,Dr. Redfield,"We are building that public health capacity now to make sure that we stay in the containment mode for the upcoming fall and winter seasons, so we will not need to resort to the kind of mitigation that we had to this spring."
2020-04-22,05:37,Dr. Redfield,"I have confidence in our public health response of early case recognition that we’ve talked about, isolation and contact tracing, combined with our plans for increased surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable, will be an effective of public health strategy, so our nation will be able to maintain itself in the containment mode. Again, that will be supported by the American public’s continued cooperation, obviously in the areas of personal hygiene and the types of social distancing strategies that may be appropriate."
2020-04-22,06:12,Dr. Redfield,"The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence. One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall, winter season that we’re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact the flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront. Thank you very much."
2020-04-22,06:42,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:06:42].
2020-04-22,06:42,Unnamed,"Can I ask a follow up on that, Dr. Redfield, please?"
2020-04-22,06:42,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:06:48].
2020-04-22,06:47,Donald Trump,"I don’t know what to follow up. He was misquoted, totally misquoted. He said they could come together. They didn’t talk about that. And his whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot. So that next fall we don’t have such a big season of flu and we possibly won’t. But as you said this, it’s possible if the corona even comes back, and he doesn’t know that it’s going to or not. We spoke at great length and I think the doctor will speak, if he’d like to continue, but we may have some embers and we’re going to put them out of corona, but we may have a big flu season, but that’s different. Flu is very different from corona."
2020-04-22,07:24,Unnamed,Can I ask you a follow up question [inaudible 00:07:25]?
2020-04-22,07:25,Donald Trump,"Yeah, go ahead. Sure."
2020-04-22,07:27,Unnamed,"Okay, so Dr. Redfield, the Washington post, which you did the interview with them, they quoted you as saying there’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. And when I’ve said this to others, they’ve kind of put their head bark, they don’t understand what I mean. We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time. Is that what you sent to The Washington Post?"
2020-04-22,07:51,Dr. Redfield,"Yeah, that’s what I was trying to say to you just a minute ago, that the issue that I was talking about, about being more difficult, is that we’re going to have two viruses circulating at the same time. This spring, that we just went through, February, we had a benefit of having the flu season ended so we could use all our flu surveillance systems to say, “Whoops, this is coronavirus, we need to focus.” Next fall and winter, we are going to have two viruses circulating and we’re going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus. And so the comment that I made, it’s more difficult. Doesn’t mean it will be more impossible, doesn’t mean it’s going to be more, as some people have said, worse, it just means more difficult because we have to distinguish between the two."
2020-04-22,08:38,Dr. Redfield,"And what I was wanting to do and what I want to do again here is appeal to the American public to recognize they can really help like they did with mitigation, which they really helped. I need them to help now to best prepare us by getting the flu vaccine and taking flu out of the picture."
2020-04-22,08:53,Donald Trump,"But that quote … Excuse me, excuse me."
2020-04-22,08:57,Donald Trump,"We may not even coming back, just so you understand. Doctor, would you like [inaudible 00:09:01]?"
2020-04-22,09:02,Unnamed,"But that quote that I just read was accurate, right sir? That’s the quote from the Washington Post. You were accurately quoted. Correct?"
2020-04-22,09:07,Dr. Redfield,"I’m accurately quoted in The Washington Post, as difficult."
2020-04-22,09:13,Unnamed,But the headline was [inaudible 00:09:13].
2020-04-22,09:13,Donald Trump,What does the headline say? Read the headline.
2020-04-22,09:16,Unnamed,The headline says CDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastating. And isn’t that kind of what he says?
2020-04-22,09:25,Donald Trump,That’s not what he said.
2020-04-22,09:25,Unnamed,But if you have the two things happening-
2020-04-22,09:29,Donald Trump,The headline doesn’t cover the [inaudible 00:09:29] story.
2020-04-22,09:29,Dr. Redfield,"No, I actually think it’s actually going to be … I think the American public is going to heed the request to re-look at their vaccine hesitancy, to vaccine with confidence for flu. And I’m confident that the public health infrastructure that we’re putting together now across this country, so that we can early case diagnose, isolate and contact trace, as I say, block and tackle, block and tackle. That system is going to be there and we’re going to be able to contain this fire."
2020-04-22,09:55,Crowd,[crosstalk 00:00:10:00].
2020-04-22,10:00,Unnamed,"Why did you retweet the article if it was inaccurate, Doctor? Why did you retweet it?"
2020-04-22,10:01,Donald Trump,You weren’t [inaudible 00:10:05].
2020-04-22,10:04,Unnamed,"We talked about this yesterday when you asked me this question and someone, I think, used the word devastating. And I want to really, again, emphasize to the American public that when we first interacted with this virus for the first time in the February and March timeframe, we didn’t have an understanding of its transmissibility, all of its symptoms. We do now and I think what we are building together and that when we talk about the public health infrastructure, it is very much working on the surveillance piece. But I think we also know the strength of the American people and their ability to immediately understand how to protect themselves with not touching their face, making sure that they’re washing their hands, but the other piece I wanted just to talk about, and we mentioned yesterday also, that we have the summer while we have flu surveillance that we can utilize and syndromic management that we can utilize."
2020-04-22,11:01,Unnamed,"We have all of that time to prepare clearly the testing algorithm that you would need in a flu, potentially, if COVID came back, potentially. And so we are preparing for that potential right now. And I think we spoke to you all about that and talked about how we’re not only preparing for today and tomorrow, but we’re preparing for six months from now, three months from now, and making sure that all of these pieces are in place. I think what Dr. Redfield clearly was asking for, just like we ask for every American to follow the guidelines, he’s saying, “Please add to that guidelines, getting your flu shot and making sure you’re protected.”"
2020-04-22,11:42,Donald Trump,"And [inaudible 00:11:43], everybody says there’s a good chance that COVID will not come back."
2020-04-22,11:47,Unnamed,We don’t know-
2020-04-22,11:47,Donald Trump,"And if it does come back, it’s in a very small confined area that we put out. Go ahead."
2020-04-22,11:50,Unnamed,"Well, the great thing is we’ll be able to find it earlier this time and I think that’s what we’re talking about. We’ll find those cases earlier. So what Dr. Redfield said, we would be able to stay in containment phase. And what we’re also hoping, and we talked about this about four or five weeks ago, that we’re hoping that the flu infections also go down, because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves. Want you to get your vaccine, but we also want to also protect individuals from getting the flu, because the vulnerability we know in certain populations to flu and the devastating outcomes to flu. We could prevent and decrease both of those things. So I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if potentially the virus comes back."
2020-04-22,12:48,Donald Trump,"And if it comes back, though, won’t be coming back in the form that it was, it will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. But what the doctor was saying, and I spoke to him at great length, he was saying if it should come back together, now you have a flu and you have the embers of corona. But in my opinion, from everything I’ve seen, it can never be like anything that we’ve witnessed right now. Would you say that, [inaudible 00:13:17]?"
2020-04-22,13:15,Dr. Redfield,Absolutely.
2020-04-22,13:17,Donald Trump,"It’s nothing like we’ve talked about. What we’ve just gone through, we will not go through. You could have some embers of corona and you could have a big flu system. And if they combined or if they come together, if they come together it’s not great, but we will not go through what we went through for the last two months. [inaudible 00:13:38]."
2020-04-22,13:37,Jeff (Reporter),"President, I-"
2020-04-22,13:37,Donald Trump,"Is that correct, sir?"
2020-04-22,13:37,Dr. Redfield,Right.
2020-04-22,13:37,Jeff (Reporter),"I understand that the United States will certainly be more prepared in the fall, but how can you say that you know it won’t come back in the same level that it has today?"
2020-04-22,13:47,Donald Trump,"What it is estimated, it might not come back at all, Jeff. It may not come back at all. He’s talking about our worst case scenario where you have a big flu and you have some corona. And if it does come back, it’s not going to come back, and I’ve spoken to 10 different people, not going to be like it was. Also, we have much better containment now. Before nobody knew about it. Nobody knew anything about it. We understand it. Now, if we have pockets, a little pocket here, then we’re going to have it put out. It goes out and it’s going to go out fast. We’re going to be watching for it. But it’s all possible. It’s also possible it doesn’t come back at all."
2020-04-22,14:19,Jeff (Reporter),"I understand the containment, but I don’t understand how you know it won’t come back on a big scale."
2020-04-22,14:24,Donald Trump,"I didn’t say it’s not. I said if it does, it’s not going to come back on anything near what we went through, but you could have a mess where they come at the same time. And if they come at the same time, the flu is not the greatest thing in the world, Jeff. It’s not the greatest thing, either. If they come at the same time, you’ll have them both. But if we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that’s not going to be pleasant, but it’s not to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape or form."
2020-04-22,14:54,Jeff (Reporter),"If you don’t think that it’s going to come back at the same severity as it is right now, why are you still directing that taxpayer dollars you spent on emergency procurement ventilators, tens of thousands of them?"
2020-04-22,15:05,Donald Trump,"Because we have to have them for other reasons. Something else could come. I mean, we didn’t know about corona. Now we know about corona, but look at what happened. And now we did have the H1N1 swine flu, we had that. We have other things that have happened. We had various forms of flu, but nothing like what we’ve had here. Nothing at all like what we’ve had here with the virus, but something could happen. I think that the stockpiles, we’re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators right now. Nobody writes about that."
2020-04-22,15:36,Donald Trump,"You know what, the one time all they talked about with ventilators, because you didn’t think it was possible for me to solve that problem. And I solved it and nobody can believe it. I just spoke to world leaders today who desperately need ventilators. They said, “the job you’ve done” … And we’re sending 500 to Mexico, then another 500 to France. We’re sending some to Spain. We’re sending some to Italy. They’re being made by the thousands. And world leaders, I spoke to Prime Minister … I mean, I went through a lot of different calls today, I won’t even tell you, I can give you a list if you want. But I went through a lot of calls to a lot of leaders. Spoke with Pakistan. They would like to have some ventilators. We’re going to get them some ventilators."
2020-04-22,16:22,Donald Trump,"But they all said to me one thing, “It was incredible that you solved the ventilator problem, because that was a big problem.” The testing problem, we’ve done more than any other nation in the world. Go a step further. If you added up the testing of every nation in the world, put them together, we’ve done substantially more than that. You people aren’t satisfied."
2020-04-22,16:42,Donald Trump,"So let’s say we had 350 million people in the United States, let’s say. And if we gave every one of those people a test 10 times, so we give 350 people a test 10 times, the fake news media would say, “Where’s the 11th time? He didn’t do his job. Trump didn’t do his job.” Because you have a lot of bad reporting out there, it’s very sad. And it’s so bad-"
2020-04-22,17:05,Unnamed,That’s not true.
2020-04-22,17:07,Donald Trump,You’ll want the leaders are the bad reporters.
2020-04-22,17:08,Unnamed,"No, that’s not true."
2020-04-22,17:10,Donald Trump,"Let’s get onto another subject. I wanted that to be cleared up. If you want, we can get onto it later, but I want the vice president to speak. But you want to get the news accurately, you ought to write it. If you take a look at what you wrote about the ventilators, and when we became the king of ventilators, we’re making different factories all over for ventilators, by the thousands."
2020-04-22,17:32,Donald Trump,"In fact, Mike got back from Wisconsin. First thing he did, he called up. I said, “How’s it going?” He said, “You’re not going to believe.” He just saw a plant, a factory, where they’re making ventilators. I think I can say the words were unbelievable. He said it was unbelievable what he saw. The quality of the equipment, the professionalism, a tremendous number of … how many workers would you say were there?"
2020-04-22,17:55,Unnamed,Over 550. We doubled production and are about to triple production.
2020-04-22,18:01,Donald Trump,Nobody thought this could be done. The fake news was very unhappy that it was done. But you guys don’t ask me about ventilators.
2020-04-22,18:06,Unnamed,Who’s unhappy that ventilators are being made?
2020-04-22,18:06,Donald Trump,"Everybody. Because you never mention it, you never mention it. There’s no stories, what a great job we’ve done with ventilators. We’re now supplying ventilators all over the world, because no other country could have done what we did. And you should say that’s a great story. Instead you say, “Trump was slow” or … Slow? We were so fast."
2020-04-22,18:27,Donald Trump,"Plus we put the ban on so much earlier. When Nancy Pelosi, as an example, you don’t say this, when she’s having her rally in San Francisco, in Chinatown, in San Francisco, nobody wants to say that. If we didn’t, and Dr. Fauci said this, if we didn’t close our country to China, we would have been so infected like nobody’s ever seen. When you saw the chart, and we were at the top of the list in terms of success, nobody wrote it. I said, “Is anybody going to use that chart?” Nobody wrote it. In terms of mortality, you saw that. Nobody wrote it."
2020-04-22,19:01,Donald Trump,"Germany and our country, the most successful, in terms of mortality. Nobody wrote it. It would be great if you wrote the truth, but let’s get on with it, because I want Mike to speak and then we’ll take some more questions, on the assumption you’d like to and I think you probably will."
2020-04-22,19:16,Donald Trump,"It’s been encouraging to watch states begin to open up. And it really has been, it’s a beautiful thing to see. As restrictions are lifted, we must maintain vigilance and continue practicing social distancing. I encourage governors to follow a careful phased approach and I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines, very important. The governors are going to adhere hopefully, or they’re going to do what they think is best. I want them to do what they think is best, but ideally they’ll adhere."
2020-04-22,19:49,Donald Trump,"Wash your hands, avoid close physical contact as much as possible, and wear a face covering when distancing is impractical, there are cases. We’ve flattened the curve and really made tremendous progress, but we must guard against a dangerous rebound. We don’t want to rebound. That’s so important. This is what we’re just talking about. We don’t want a rebound. The doctor doesn’t want a rebound. These people definitely don’t want a rebound. I don’t think you want one, do you? You, especially. We don’t want rebounds after all this death, death that we’ve suffered. Not work, I don’t view it work, I view it death that was unnecessary, should have never happened, should have never left that little area where it started. You know it, and I know it, and they know it."
2020-04-22,20:35,Donald Trump,"In our all out war against the virus, we continue to make great strides on testing, famous testing, doing more than anybody else anywhere in the world. Nothing funny about that, John."
2020-04-22,20:48,Donald Trump,"Most of the governors have never faced a situation like this before, but we’re helping them find unused testing capacity within their states. Tremendous testing capacity that the governors, in many cases, didn’t know they had. And additional capabilities are coming online every day. We’re coming up with new equipment, like the laboratory’s equipment. On site, five minutes, great success. Everybody wants it, but you can only make so many of those machines. So we have many other forms of testing. We have many other machines that do it very quickly and by the millions, by the millions. Our task force issued it’s reopening guidelines earlier than April 30th to give governors the time that they needed to develop testing capability and capacity, and customized plans for their states, which many of them did. We’ve had some governors do a fantastic job on testing and on a lot of other things. I spoke, as you know Governor Cuomo was here, we had a great conversation on testing yesterday and they’re doing a really good job in New York."
2020-04-22,21:56,Donald Trump,"We’re working very closely with each of the states to help them succeed. I spoke earlier today with Governor Newsom, California, and that was all about testing, that conversation. He’s been scaling up really well, really good job. Then I agreed to help him get some of the critical supplies that California needs to make use of the tremendous capacity that they found. This is a tremendous testing capacity and I’m going to do it very quickly. He needs certain things. We’re going to get that to him very quickly. Now, could he get it himself? Yes, but I can get it faster. He understands that, and he’s done a great job. And we’re going to have it to him, we’re going to have a lot of it to him, over the next two days and we’re going to beef it up the following weekend. Get him a lot of additional. He’s done a really terrific job in California. Some of the governors have done a fantastic job, working with us."
2020-04-22,22:49,Donald Trump,"I told the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities, which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia. They’re incredible people. I love those people. They’re great. They’ve been strong, resolute. But at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right. I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he’s doing, but I want to let the governors do. Now if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I’ll do. But I think spas, and beauty salons, and tattoo parlors, and barber shops in phase one, we’re going to have phase two very soon, is just too soon. I think it’s too soon."
2020-04-22,23:43,Donald Trump,"And I love the people. I love those people that use all of those things. The spas, and the beauty parlors, and barber shops, tattoo parlors, I love them. But they can wait a little bit longer, just a little bit, not much, because safety has to predominate. We have to have that."
2020-04-22,24:03,Donald Trump,"So I told the governor very simply that I disagree with this decision, but he has to do what he thinks is right. I’m excited to announce that in the coming weeks, the Air Force Thunderbirds are incredible, and the Navy Blue Angels, equally incredible, will be performing air shows over America’s major cities and some of the cities that aren’t major cities. They’re going to be doing a lot of work, a lot of very dangerous flying. It’s dangerous. You know the odds when you start going at massive speeds and you’re 18 inches away from each other, it’s dangerous work. Your son is a great pilot and I don’t know if he could be … Could he be a Thunderbird? I don’t know."
2020-04-22,24:49,Unnamed,We’ll see.
2020-04-22,24:50,Donald Trump,"I think he probably could, from what I hear. I don’t know if I’d want him to be, because it is, it’s incredible what they’re able to do and to sacrifice. Our front line, what we’re doing is we’re paying tribute to our front line. Healthcare-"
2020-04-22,25:03,Donald Trump,"We’re doing is we’re paying tribute to our frontline healthcare workers confronting Covid. And it’s really a signal to all Americans to remain vigilant during the outbreak. This is a tribute to them, to our warriors. Because they are equal warriors to those incredible pilots and all of the fighters that we have for the more traditional fights, that we win. And we win and we want to win, we always win. Sometimes we don’t want to win, so we just go to a standstill. But that’s not the way this country works."
2020-04-22,25:37,Donald Trump,"Operation America Strong was the idea of our great military men and women, the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels crews, who wanted to show support to the American medical workers who just like military members in a time of war are fiercely running toward the fight. It’s going to be great, I want to see those shows. I’ve seen them many times and I can’t get enough of them. And on July 4th we’ll be doing what we had at the mall. As you know, we’re going to be doing it. Last year was a tremendous success and I would imagine we’ll do it, hopefully, I can use the term forever. That was a great success, as you remember. Even though it was pouring, it was raining so hard. It was raining about as hard as I’ve seen in a while, but it was an amazing success. Didn’t bother the pilots, didn’t bother the military, didn’t bother the crews that we had there. So we’re going to be doing that again on July 4th."
2020-04-22,26:33,Donald Trump,"Our great military is operating at 100% during this crisis and thousands of troops are deployed alongside of civilians and the Covid hotspots, as you know, you see them all over. When I spoke with Governor Cuomo, and when I spoke to Gavin Newsom and many of the other governors, they wanted to know if we could have some military help with the medical. And we gave it to them. And in every case they said, “Fantastic.” I mean, just fantastic."
2020-04-22,27:04,Donald Trump,"New York City Mayor de Blasio called me to say it was inspiring to watch. He was there when the military came in. He said it gave everybody spirit, when he saw the professionalism and the spirit that they had. They walked in and they helped a lot of people, doctors, nurses, respiratory technicians and professionals. It was an incredible thing. But everybody that saw them going to work said that was something special. So we’re going to have some tremendous air shows all throughout our country. That’s in honor of what we’re all going through together and the people that are helping us so much. And, unfortunately, the people who have passed away from something that should never have been allowed to happen."
2020-04-22,27:51,Donald Trump,"Following around-the-clock negotiations yesterday, the Senate answered my call to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program so that millions of additional American workers can keep getting a paycheck. We just increased it by $310 billion. I urged the house to pass the bill without delay. In our first round of funding we provided nearly $350 billion and it went at record speed to American workers and small businesses. It’s really been an incredible, incredible success. I want to thank the banks. We had the big banks, the little banks, the commercial banks of all kinds. Community banks were fantastic, by the way, community banks."
2020-04-22,28:41,Donald Trump,"As you know, this was an interesting story, in recent days I’ve called for Harvard, that’s Harvard University, which has a $40 billion endowment fund to return the money that it was allocated under the CARES Act. I’m pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds. Nor will Stanford University, or many of the others that were involved both on a university level also on a company level. Some of the companies were bigger than people had represented, or bigger than people had thought, and a strong enough that they didn’t need the money. So, there’s a certain amount of money that we are not sending."
2020-04-22,29:28,Donald Trump,"As soon as I heard it I said, “Stop funds.” And for the most part I guess they stopped it, Mike, right? They stopped it, they’re not accepting the money and that’s great. So I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford, and I want to thank the other companies in the case. It’s broken differently between colleges and companies, but I want to thank the companies and the other great universities. And there’s some great ones."
2020-04-22,29:54,Donald Trump,"The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday also reserves $30 billion in loans for small financial institutions that serve minority and distressed communities. They’re very important. We’re determined to protect our African American, Hispanic American and minority workers who have been hit so hard by this hidden enemy. My administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to address the full spectrum of needs in these communities, supporting both health and economic revitalization. First, my administration is committed to providing the testing that is needed to fight the virus in distressed communities. In the last month alone, we’ve already sent over one point $4 billion to our nation’s 13,000 community healthcare centers. Think of that, 13,000. To increase testing and treatment in the underserved areas, we’re also expanding access to telehealth."
2020-04-22,30:51,Donald Trump,"Telehealth has become a big deal. You know, I’ve been reading about it for years and all of a sudden because of this it’s become a big thing. People can’t leave their houses, they didn’t want to leave their houses for various reasons including they wanted to follow the guidelines. The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday, and I want to thank everybody. A great, great vote, great. As you know, it was a unanimous vote. How often do you see that?"
2020-04-22,31:17,Donald Trump,"The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday includes an additional $25 billion to further expand testing, and provides even more funding for community health centers, in various forms of epidemics and pandemics. We’ll be working on that, because as per a couple of your statements and questions before, we want to work on that for the future. We hope this doesn’t happen again for… Again ever. But last time of this magnitude, 1917. That’s a long time ago. So we want to be prepared, and we are prepared. And as I told you, we’re building up not only our stockpile, which is being built up greatly, but also hospital stockpiles. We’re getting them what they need. We’re working out cost arrangements with them. And we’re getting them a lot of the ventilators, which are the hardest thing for them to get, both from a cost standpoint and a technical standpoint."
2020-04-22,32:16,Donald Trump,"At the same time, we’re also supporting the establishment of new testing sites focused on these communities. 40 sites have launched so far and there are plans to launch dozens more in the next three weeks. We’re coming up with testing apparatus and testing plans that are incredible when you look at the numbers. Some people are very, very big on testing. I’m big on testing, but some people are much less big than I am, I will tell you. And they’re professionals. But we want to have it so that nobody can talk about, “Gee whiz, I wish we had more testing.” Nobody’s done it like we’ve done it and nobody will, and we’re getting very much stronger. We have incredible professionals doing it. So many different tests have not evolved, people are finding it even hard to believe."
2020-04-22,33:07,Donald Trump,"My administration is working closely with governors to ensure that they have the testing infrastructure in place to reduce further spread of the virus, if they’re so inclined to use the testing apparatus. Including strategies for older individuals, low-income Americans, minorities, and native Americans."
2020-04-22,33:28,Donald Trump,"As part of the effort, the White House Task Force headed up by Mike, who has done incredible… I’ll say it every time, I’ll say it to anybody that wants to listen. Mike Pence has done an incredible job, really an incredible job. Thank you… Is providing technical assistance to all 50 States through one-on-one phone calls as they develop and implement their plans. In addition, my administration’s committed to restoring Black and Hispanic communities to full economic health. They want to be healthy economically and physically, and that’s what we’re doing. To that end, today I’m directing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council led by Secretary Ben Carson to focus its effort on supporting underserved communities impacted by the Coronavirus. Ben Carson is working on that with Mike and myself, and a lot of other people. I’m going to ask Tim Scott, who was so helpful with the Opportunity Zones, it’s an economic answer to a lot of problems. Tim Scott was fantastic and so I’m going to ask him to get involved with you. I’m sure he’ll be willing to do it from South Carolina."
2020-04-22,34:39,Donald Trump,"I also asked the council to identify what additional funding will be required from Congress beyond what has already been provided. We’re really building ourself a strong base and we’re building ourself a wall that’s a very different from the kind of walls that you’ve been hearing me talking about. But nevertheless, in many ways, performs the same function and hopefully it’s going to perform it equally as well. Furthermore, the council will seek input from the private sector and community leaders on how we can best support minority and distressed communities."
2020-04-22,35:13,Donald Trump,"As President, I’m absolutely determined to deliver a great future for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Before our nation was attacked by this horrible enemy, our African American, Hispanic American citizens were prospering like never before. Best employment numbers, ever. Not only African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. Every American. We were breaking records at every level. We had almost 160 million people employed. We were never even close to that number. And we were also breaking them economically, highest stock market numbers, highest numbers of every kind. And I think we’re going to be back there, and I think it’s going to be much sooner rather than later. And, I think we’ll surpass those numbers including our employment numbers."
2020-04-22,36:06,Donald Trump,"But I’ll not rest until that prosperity has been fully restored and again, I really believe that we’re going to lift those numbers higher than ever before and it won’t be as long as people might think. A lot of very smart people are looking at that and they’re betting, you just have to look at what’s going on with the stock market."
2020-04-22,36:25,Donald Trump,"In order to protect our great American workers I’ve just signed an Executive Order temporarily suspending immigration into the United States. This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens. Crucially, it will also preserve our healthcare resources for American patients. We have to take care of our patients. We have to take care of our great American workers, and that’s what we’re doing. I’ve just signed it just before coming into the room, very important. And as to amending it or extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time. But it’s now signed."
2020-04-22,37:09,Donald Trump,"Earlier today, the First Lady and I planted a tree on the South Lawn of the White House in recognition of the 50th Annual Earth Day. I was glad to announce that we will begin to reopen our national parks and public lands. We want Americans to be able to satisfy and be really safe. We want them to satisfy their family that safety is going to happen. And it will happen. Maybe even at a level like never before, we’ve learned so much. But we want them to enjoy these great national treasures as we continue to take reasonable precautions, and hopefully it’ll be just reasonable."
2020-04-22,37:49,Donald Trump,"My administration has directed more than $7 billion in federal funding to support the development of treatments, diagnostics, and therapies. And that’s something, doctors, I hope you can really work on. It’s something so powerful and so important. The FDA, the NIH and industry leaders are establishing master clinical trial protocols to test multiple promising new drugs at the same time. And we’re doing a lot of testing right now. More than 1600 locations across the country have signed up to administer convalescent plasma to patients, infusing them with antibodies of those who have recovered. And when they recover, I said it last time, practically the first thing they say is, “I want to give my blood so that I can help other people.” They want to give that blood. It’s incredible. They’re laying in bed, they’re still in pretty weakened conditions and they say, “I want to give my blood.” And that’s happening all the time, isn’t it?"
2020-04-22,38:50,Donald Trump,"If you recovered from the Coronavirus, I ask you to consider contacting your local blood or plasma donation center to arrange a donation that could potentially save many lives. We have love for our nation and loyalty for our fellow citizens. We will safeguard our families, care for our neighbors, heal the sick, protect our workers, and build a future for a country that is the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we’re only going to get greater. Thank you, very much. Mike Pence, please."
2020-04-22,39:25,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. White House Coronavirus Task Force met today. And despite the fact that there’ve been more than 843,000 Americans who contracted the Coronavirus and we grieve the loss of more than 47,000 of our countrymen, according to Dr. Birx and her team, we continue to see encouraging signs. Because the American people had been putting into practice the guidance that’s been issued by the President and this task force, and they’ve been taken to heart and the guidance of state and local officials. And Mr. President as we learned today, we are continuing to see declines in all the major metro areas around the country that had been most impacted."
2020-04-22,40:16,Mike Pence,"Numbers remain low and steady on the West coast, in Washington State and in California. The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut all appear to be past their peak. And as our scientists may reflect in a few moments, we also are seeing the positive rate going down. Which is, actually, even as encouraging as the declining cases. The Detroit metro area appears to be past its peak. Seattle metro area, as I mentioned, remains stable. New Orleans metro area is the most stable of all the large metro outbreaks. We also are continuing to see a stabilization and even declines in Houston, and Atlanta, and Nashville, and Baltimore, and Indianapolis, and elsewhere."
2020-04-22,41:03,Mike Pence,"This is a tribute to the American people. To the fact that the American people have taken to heart the guidelines, the social distancing, the personal hygiene, the recommendation that you use the drive through at a restaurant rather than going in a restaurant, and avoiding groups of more than 10. On the President’s behalf, on behalf of our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, we just want to urge all of the American people to continue onward."
2020-04-22,41:31,Mike Pence,"We all want to reopen America, and we want to reopen our States and our communities as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so. But I want to say to my countrymen, the fastest way to reopen America is to continue to do what you’ve been doing. It’s the fastest way, as President Trump has said many times, to get our country working again is to put the coronavirus in the past. And we are on our way to doing just that."
2020-04-22,42:01,Mike Pence,"Early on, the President called forth not only the full power of the Federal Government, but he called forth the full weight of the American economy. And I had the privilege yesterday to travel to Madison, Wisconsin, and see American industry and American workers at their very best. I want to thank the GE Healthcare team in Wisconsin, as well as the union machinists that I spent time with all day yesterday. It was extraordinary, Mr. President, earlier this month you used the Defense Production Act to ensure that supplies could flow to GE, and General Motors, and Ford, and other companies that were prepared to repurpose manufacturing lines and hire new workers to construct ventilators."
2020-04-22,42:48,Mike Pence,"At this particular plant, the Machinist Union sat down and in less than one week negotiated a new contract with GE Healthcare that allowed them to begin to bring in workers from around the country. They doubled their work line in one a week. They’re about to triple it. They’ve been going 24 hours a day, three shifts, seven days a week. And the President promised that by harnessing the power of the American economy we would have 100,000 ventilators in 100 days. But thanks to the ingenuity and the hardworking Americans that I was with yesterday and other companies, we’re actually going to have 110, 000 ventilators in 100 days. They were all wearing T-shirts, Mr. President, I brought one back for you that simply read, “Union Machinist’s Save Lives.” To that great team of GE Healthcare I want to just say all of America is proud of you and grateful for you."
2020-04-22,43:47,Mike Pence,"We’re also grateful to all of our healthcare workers at every level and all the work that they’re doing. And we’re proud that our National Guard and our American military are at their side. As our task force learned today, more than 31,000 National Guard have been stood up around the country. The President, in the last day, extended what’s called Title 32 Authorizations for all National Guard personnel through May 31. So we’re going to continue to partner with States as the National Guard plays a vital role in testing and in cleaning nursing homes and in standing up state’s response. Military personnel, Mr. President, we have more than a 5,500 active duty military personnel. Including, as of yesterday, 964 medical professionals in the uniform of the United States working in 17 hospitals in 7 States around the country."
2020-04-22,44:40,Mike Pence,"We’re also very proud of our team at the VA. The VA has addressed its capacity issues. It’s not seen cases among the veterans in its facilities increased so they’re deploying teams to focus on nursing homes. In Massachusetts, the VA personnel have disinfected two different nursing homes. In New Jersey, they’ve literally taken over two State nursing homes and deployed 90 doctors and nurses. And, in Florida we’re sending 16 teams to assist in nursing home operations."
2020-04-22,45:13,Mike Pence,"As the President also mentioned, in addition to what I saw yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to build our strategic national stockpile. It’s growing again with ventilators, nearly 11,000 in supply. 901 new ventilators will be added, transitioned, in the near term. Every American, I think, can be confident that should the need arise for your family member facing serious consequences from the coronavirus to need that equipment to help them breathe, that equipment will be there. As we said yesterday in Wisconsin, and you’ve said Mr. President, I think it should be a great source of comfort to every American that no American who has required a ventilator in the United States has been denied a ventilator. And that’s a testament to our healthcare workers. A testament to every American putting mitigation principles into practice. And it’s a testament of these great companies."
2020-04-22,46:15,Mike Pence,"Speaking of great companies, American businesses are stepping up. It was on April 1st that I traveled to a Walmart distribution center and the President reached out to the president and CEO of Walmart to ask Walmart to get in the gowns business. And Mr. President, I’m glad to report to you that we heard today at the task force that Walmart is producing 8.4 million gowns, and they will be delivered into our commercial supply to healthcare facilities around the country by the end of June. They’re hardly alone. Honda is producing 500,000 face shields. New balance is making 100,000 masks a week."
2020-04-22,46:55,Mike Pence,"In a very real sense, the American people have stepped up to make the sacrifices and endure the hardship that social distancing has required. But American businesses at every size and every means have come together to respond to the President’s call."
2020-04-22,47:12,Mike Pence,"It really has been a whole-of-America approach. Our message from the President’s White House Coronavirus Task Force is to tell the American people it’s working, we’re getting there. We can see light at the end of the tunnel. We can see the data that we can reopen and put America back to work. But it’s going to take all of us continuing to make the sacrifices necessary, to practice those disciplines, to get us to a place where we can reopen safely and confidently. With that, Mr. President, I’ll call Dr.Fauci up for his reflections and then we’ll move on."
2020-04-22,47:47,Donald Trump,Great.
2020-04-22,47:51,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. I’m going to just take off from where I was at this podium a few days ago. To reiterate some of the things that the Vice President said, but to connect the dots from where we were, where we are now, and where I think we’re going to be. So, you remember a couple of weeks ago when we talked about the fact that we were going to have a really bad week because the deaths, particularly driven by the situation in New York, were going to get worse and worse. But yet, as that was happening, we were starting to see some turnaround, some flattening, and some coming down. As you’ve heard from Dr. Birx, and will likely hear more, that is continuing. What has happened is that the mitigation that we put in with the first 15 days, and then the 30 day mitigation program of physical distancing, worked. It got us to where we are today. It is a successful formula. It is the basis for our being able to say that we can now think seriously about reopening America. And for that reason we put together a carefully thought out and, I believe, well delineated and described program for opening up America again. And you know what it is, it’s the guidelines that we announced a few days ago. Those very guidelines are based on a version of the successful formula that got us to where we are."
2020-04-22,49:26,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So what I’m trying to say, is that the program is not one that is going to be, “Turn the lights on in America, we’re finished.” We’re not. We have to proceed in a very careful, measured way. And if you look at the guidelines, they are careful and they are measured. There are certain checkpoints, before you can even think about going into a Phase One. And then things relax a little as you go into Phase Two. And relax a little, and you go into Phase Three. Now we live in a big country and it’s heterogeneous, and there are different dynamics of outbreaks in different-"
2020-04-22,50:03,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"And it’s heterogeneous and there are different dynamics of outbreaks in different parts of the country. So, the speed with which one can go from one to another, at the point at which you can even begin to think about the phase, is going to different. So, the one thing that I know, the urge we all have to get out there and get it over with. Let’s get back to normal, for a lot of good reasons because there’s a lot of suffering, economic and otherwise in this country because of that. But again, as I’ve pleaded early on weeks ago, I plead with the American public, with the governors, with the mayors, for the people with responsibility. Although, I know one has the need to leapfrog over things, don’t do that. Do it in a measured way. This is a successful formula. The problem is if we don’t do that, there is a likelihood that we’ll have a rebound. And the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we can’t take care of. So, please again, let me just close by pleading with the American public in general and those who are responsible leaders to carefully consider how we get back to normal. Thank you."
2020-04-22,51:13,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, could you talk a little bit about your expectations for the fall? We heard from Dr. Redfield and Dr. Birx. What do you see for the Fall? Is it going to be embers or possibly no return to the virus at all?"
2020-04-22,51:24,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"As I’VE said before here, when you look at an outbreak, it’s two dynamic forces opposing each other. If you leave the virus to its own devices, it will take off if you do nothing to stop it. If you put into place the kinds of things that we talk about. First, containment and then hopefully you never get to mitigation but containment is important. Those two forces are going to determine whether you’re going to have a big outbreak. So, what Dr. Redfield was saying first of all, is that we will have coronavirus in the Fall. I am convinced of that because of the degree of transmissibility that has the global nature. What happens with that will depend on how we’re able to contain it when it occurs. And what we’re saying is that in the Fall we will be much better prepared to do the containment compared to what happened to us this winter. Now, the complicating issue is that unlike the syndromic and influenza-like observances that we have, that you could pick it up by clinically what’s happening. It’s going to get complicated by influenza season. And I believe that’s what Dr. Redfield was saying, that is going to be complicated. So, whether or not it’s going to be big or small is going to depend on our response, and that’s what I think people sometimes have misunderstanding. Nobody can predict what is going to happen with an outbreak, but you can predict how you’re going to respond to it. And that’s really very important."
2020-04-22,53:11,Unnamed,"So, you would caution against people thinking that in the Fall there’s not going to be coronavirus anymore. We won’t have to worry about it or if it is, it’ll be spotty and it won’t be a big problem we have to worry about."
2020-04-22,53:23,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"There will be coronavirus in the Fall. If we do, which we won’t, but let’s take an imaginary period. We say, okay, coronavirus, forget about it. We’re not going to do anything about it. It will take off. That’s what viruses do, but that’s not what’s going to happen. We are going to respond to it to not allow it to do that."
2020-04-22,53:41,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, what happens when governor’s like governor Kemp are not following this careful measured plan and moving forward even without meeting the gating criteria? What do we do about that?"
2020-04-22,53:55,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Well, if I were advising the governor, I would tell him that he should be careful and I would advise him not to just turn the switch on and go because there is a danger of a rebound and I know there’s that desire to move the head quickly. That’s a natural human nature desire, but going ahead and leapfrogging into phases where you should not be, I would advise him as a health official and as a physician not to do that."
2020-04-22,54:24,Donald Trump,"Okay? All right, good."
2020-04-22,54:24,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. Can you give some details about the executive order? I know that the White House has just released a document that we haven’t had a chance to review it."
2020-04-22,54:39,Donald Trump,"Well, we can talk about that later. It’s an executive order on immigration. We want Americans to have the jobs, we want Americans to have the healthcare. We want to take care of our citizens first, we have to, and it’s a very powerful order. It’s for 60 days. At the end of 60 days or maybe even during 60 days I’ll extend it or not and I’ll maybe change it. I might modify it. Yes?"
2020-04-22,55:02,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 00:55:02] immigrants who are already here, Mr. President?"
2020-04-22,55:02,Donald Trump,"Yeah, go ahead, please."
2020-04-22,55:03,Unnamed,"Immigrants who are already here in the country or immigrants abroad who are already affected, who have a green card trying to get into the country and healthcare workers?"
2020-04-22,55:13,Donald Trump,"You’re talking about immigrants that are trying to get it and we’re talking about people, and also by the way, people that are coming in illegally. Now, as you know, because you’ve seen the numbers. Our Southern border is very tight. Hasn’t been this tight in years. It’s being helped by 116, more than that, miles of wall that are going up. I’m trying to get to 450 by the end of the year, 450 miles, and we’ll have 530 miles early next year. And that’s really great, it’s fully funded. We have all the funds and the Army Corps of Engineers is doing a fantastic job. Same people that did you have at Java Center, as you know. They’re doing a fantastic job. So, our Southern border’s very tight for very good reason. We’re also being helped by 27,000 very good soldiers from Mexico, and I want to thank the president of Mexico. He’s been terrific in many ways, including on what we’re doing with COVID. And as you know, we have a very good trade arrangement with Mexico now, which we didn’t have before. So, I want to thank the president of Mexico in particular for the 27,000 soldiers. They’re doing a fantastic job. We want to protect our healthcare."
2020-04-22,56:21,Unnamed,"For healthcare workers, sir? You want to talk about the exemption for healthcare workers?"
2020-04-22,56:27,Donald Trump,"We want to protect our healthcare workers, and that’s one of the other reasons we’re doing this. Yes, John?"
2020-04-22,56:30,John (Reporter),"Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about Rick Bright. He’s the head of the federal agency in charge of getting a vaccine out to Americans once it’s ready. He says he has been pushed out of his job because he raised questions about hydroxychloroquine and some of your directives on that. Was he pushed out of that job?"
2020-04-22,56:47,Donald Trump,I never heard of him. You just mentioned a name. I never heard of him. When did this happen?
2020-04-22,56:51,John (Reporter),This happened today.
2020-04-22,56:52,Donald Trump,"Well, I never heard of him. The guy says he was pushed out of a job. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t. You’d have to hear the other side. I don’t know who he is. Please?"
2020-04-22,57:00,John (Reporter),And on the hydroxychloroquine?
2020-04-22,57:03,Unnamed,"I just wondered, you said by 4th of July you expect people to be on the national mall and we’ll be having a celebration like we did last year."
2020-04-22,57:09,Donald Trump,Hope so.
2020-04-22,57:10,Unnamed,"Given what the doctors are just saying, that coronavirus is still going to be out there. Might not be as bad as it is now, but it’s still going to circulating. Is that going to be safe to have that many people in the mall?"
2020-04-22,57:20,Donald Trump,"We’re going to probably have 25% of what we had last year. Last year as you know was maxed out. I saw a magnificent picture of Dr. Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful, very similar. This year, most likely we’ll be standing six feet apart. We’ll have to do that in a very interesting way and maybe we’ll even do it greater, so we’ll leave a little extra distance. But if we do that, we’d certainly do that. I don’t see maybe the purpose that we can’t do that, we have to have people… We had tens of thousands. Most of you were there, tens of thousands of people, last year was incredible and it was to an extent an air show. All the different aircraft flying over. We even had Air Force One flying over, so ideally it would be wonderful if we could actually have it as it was last year, and eventually we will have that. I think it’s important to know eventually we are going to have that. The stadiums are going to be the way they’ve been for the last 100 years?"
2020-04-22,58:26,Unnamed,[crosstalk 00:58:26] able to have.
2020-04-22,58:26,Donald Trump,"Right. I know, but your stadiums as an example, sports, it’s going to be the way they it used to be. I told one of the owners, he said, “Do you think I should take out seats?” I said, “No, you shouldn’t take out seats. We’re going to have it the way it was. We’re going to be back.” This virus will eventually be gone and if it should show up in the Fall, we’re going to put it out very fast. We have great people. We’re going to put it out very fast because we’ve learned a lot about how to deal with this and we’ll put it out very fast. Yeah, please? Just nice and easy to start, thank you."
2020-04-22,59:00,Unnamed,"You talk a lot about testing capacity and governors agree that that exists, but it’s very different from testing implementation and they are still begging for you to use your full authority to help them get reagents and other things. As you would like to say, what do you have to lose by helping them do that and becoming the king of testing?"
2020-04-22,59:18,Donald Trump,"And let me just say, we are thinking of testing already. There’s no country in the world that’s done more. Not even-"
2020-04-22,59:23,Unnamed,0.2% of the population has been tested. Is that good enough?
2020-04-22,59:27,Donald Trump,"I just said there’s no country in the world that’s done more and we have tests that have already come out that are going to be introduced very shortly that will do it more. My problem is this. I’d say it’s very much of a media trap. Whether we did 2%, 5%, 50% or 100%, it’ll never be enough. No matter what. Now, with the expertise and with what we did because of our expertise and tremendous talent at manufacturing. What we did with the ventilators, that wasn’t a trap because we got them done shockingly to everybody because of the incredible talent like Mike Pence saw yesterday in Wisconsin. But we have numerous of those sites all over the country doing the same thing, so that when the governors were complaining, some of the governors, I must say, and it was very much along party lines for the most part except for one, when the governors were complaining, we said, “No. How many do you need?” “We need 50, we need 100.” One governor asks for many thousands and it turned out they didn’t need that and that’s good. We got them and nobody, you know this, and we went through this with the governors, that needed a ventilator didn’t get a ventilator."
2020-04-22,01:00:41,Donald Trump,"That was an incredible achievement. For testing, it’s a little different. It’s much easier than ventilators. It’s like 2%, but for instance the swabs are coming in by the millions. They’re literally coming in by the millions. Totally ordered. We wanted the highest quality. We could have gotten a much lesser quality. We didn’t want to do that. We got the highest quality, but testing, it’s like no matter how well you do, you can always say more. With the ventilators, they either have them or they don’t. In fact, we went to one meeting. “Who wants a ventilator?” One governor said, “We’d like 25.” “25? You got him. Who else?” Nobody spoke up. That was four weeks ago, so that was great. The problem with the testing is, and I said, if we tested 350 million people, you’ll say we want them to have a second test or a third test or a fourth test. Not everybody believes as strongly as some people in testing. Some people want to do testing because they think it’s impossible for us to fulfill that goal."
2020-04-22,01:01:44,Donald Trump,"That’s easy compared to ventilators as I’ve said, but we have a tremendous testing capability. Better than anybody in the world right now and every day it’s growing and it’s growing very substantially. These doctors are very talented people. They’ve seen testing all their lives. They’ve never seen anything like we’ve been able to do, so we’re going to give everybody what they want with the testing. But again, testing, and I’ve said it from the beginning, the actual test has to be administered locally. You can’t do from Washington or far away locations federal testing nearly as well as you can where you have a governor, he has mayors and they have representatives and they know the back of a Walmart. Put it in the parking lot in the back of a Walmart or put it in a certain location in different states. They are doing it beautifully. It’s working beautifully. The relationship I have and Mike has and we all have with the governors, I would say other than one or two, but even them, they don’t complain. They’re not complaining. So, we’re doing tremendous testing and ultimately we’re doing more testing I think than probably any of the governors even want. Okay, please?"
2020-04-22,01:02:55,Unnamed,"Back on the immigration EO, can you say is it just for green card holders or is it also for people seeking temporary work visas?"
2020-04-22,01:02:59,Donald Trump,"It’s subject to change. We have some people coming in, for instance, helping the farmers. We want to have the farmers take care, they’ve been coming for years and years and they’re helping our farmers and they’ve been coming in for years. We don’t want to do… The border has been turned off a number of times over the years and you know what happened? Our farmers all went out of business. They were out of business. They couldn’t farm. We’re taking care of our farmers. Nobody ever took care of farmers like I take care of farmers. Including the $19 billion that we’re dispersing to farmers because of some very good things that happened."
2020-04-22,01:03:34,Unnamed,Subject to change because some of your advisors are saying there could be a problem with it or subject to change-
2020-04-22,01:03:39,Donald Trump,"No, just it might be modified. It could be modified next week, in two weeks. It could be modified in two months. Now, we may modify as we go along, but right now we have a very powerful immigration ban, but it could be modified, meaning made tougher or made less tough. We don’t want to hurt our businesses and we don’t want to hurt our farmers. Very important. Please."
2020-04-22,01:04:03,Unnamed,"Can I ask you about your conversation with governor Kemp? What did he say to you when you said you strongly disagreed with him and for gym owners and tattoo parlor artists and barbers in Atlanta and Georgia generally, would you to advise them to listen to you and not to their governor?"
2020-04-22,01:04:18,Donald Trump,"Look, I’d like them to listen to their governors, all of their governors. I have the right to do if I wanted to clamp it down, but I have respect for our governors. They know what they’re doing. I think… And as you know, Brian Kemp, governor of Georgia, I worked very hard for his election. He beat their superstar. He beat the superstar of their party. I think you could say I helped a lot. Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, they all went in. They campaigned for him very hard, and he lost. He also was way down in the primary and ended up winning the primary after I came out and endorsed him. So, a lot of good things and there’s a lot of good feeling between myself and Brian Kemp. I like him a lot. I happen to disagree with him only in time and timing."
2020-04-22,01:05:04,Donald Trump,"I disagree. When you have spas, beauty parlors, and I love these people. I know the people from spas and beauty parlors, tattoo parlors. Bikers for Trump, a lot of tattoos. I love them, I love these people. And barbershops, these are great people, but you know what? Maybe you wait a little bit longer until you get into a phase two. So, do I agree with him? No, but I respect him and I will let him make his decision. Would I do that? No. I’d keep them a little longer. I want to protect people’s lives, but I’m going to let him make his decision. But I told him I totally disagree. Okay?"
2020-04-22,01:05:42,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. The vice president in his remarks is talking about the federal efforts that have been undertaken as it relates to nursing facilities. And as you both know, they are just so incredibly hard hit. Just tragic. Over 10,000 COVID-19 deaths so far. The industry says that they’re struggling as it relates to testing. Can you commit to increasing testing at the nursing facilities across-"
2020-04-22,01:06:07,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 01:06:07] automatically. That’s almost common sense. But we’re doing that automatically. You look at the state of Washington, that was our first glimpse of it. They got hit so horribly in that nursing home. It just seemed like everybody was from a particular nursing home. So, we knew immediately that was going to be a problem and we’re doing that 100%. we’re taking very special care of our nursing homes and our seniors other than me. Nobody wants to take care of me, but other than me, we’re taking care of our seniors."
2020-04-22,01:06:36,Unnamed,"In other areas… Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-22,01:06:39,Mike Pence,"No, it’s just an enormously important question and we want to thank the American people who have been putting off visits to their grandmothers and grandfathers and moms and dads. It’s tough. I’m going to be in Indiana next week and I’m not going to go see my mom. She lives in her own home, but people get it that the risk of serious illness for a healthy American of the coronavirus is fairly low. You’ll either have flu like symptoms or no symptoms at all, but as we’ve said so many times at this podium and the American people get it, a healthy American could inadvertently convey the coronavirus to a senior with an underlying health condition, and have the kind of heartbreaking results that we’ve seen in nursing homes around the country. It’s the reason why from early on the president took decisive action to raise the infectious disease standards at every nursing home in America."
2020-04-22,01:07:43,Mike Pence,"He deployed all 8,000 of our inspectors at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to dedicate all of their time to ensuring compliance with those new higher standards. We’ve spoken about nursing home issues with governors around the country and frankly there are governors around the country that have done remarkable work with nursing homes. You’ve mentioned governor Brian Kemp. He actually used the National Guard in Georgia. He deployed them to nursing homes to do cleaning and to disinfect areas of those nursing homes and it’s tremendous service. But to your point about testing, if you look carefully at the guidelines, Open Up America Again, you will see that in phase one, the level of testing that we contemplate is first that we want to be able to test anyone who has the symptoms that may be coronavirus and be able to test them quickly. Secondly, we want to do the contact tracing and Dr. Redfield and his team are deploying CDC teams in every state in America to be able to find out everyone that that person has been in contact with and test them."
2020-04-22,01:08:53,Mike Pence,"But if you look right underneath that, what we’re directing states to do is be prepared to deploy testing resources first and foremost in nursing homes and longterm care facilities so that we can monitor any potential outbreak of the coronavirus among the most vulnerable population. And thanks to the leadership of our surgeon general, as the president announced today, we’re also going to be deploying testing resources to vulnerable communities, to underserved communities. The CDC released new preliminary data on the impact particularly on African American communities in this country, and it’s the reason why part of our phase one recommendation is that we deploy testing resources into those communities that are described by the doctors as socially vulnerable. And even as we speak, we’ll announce next week that we’re already in the process of deploying testing. And so, it’s a good opportunity to remind every American to be especially careful around our seniors, to heed the guidance about avoiding visitations, to protect the health of those who are most vulnerable. But the American people can be assured that from phase one forward all the way through phase three and reopening, we’re going to be helping to guide the states to focus on the most vulnerable, beginning with our seniors with serious underlying health conditions."
2020-04-22,01:10:33,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. president. Commercial labs say that they need to buy new diagnostic machines to be able to double their testing capacity. Your administration has said that there’s enough testing capacity to double overnight. How do you square that difference?"
2020-04-22,01:10:47,Donald Trump,"Very easy, they can get new machines if they want, but even if they didn’t we have tremendous testing capability. You take a look at what’s happening in California and New York. Governor Cuomo told us very strongly, he said, “Wow, we have a lot of labs.” That’s a research center of the world. In California too, long conversations, they have tremendous testing capability there too. Now, if they want to increase it, they can increase it, but they have plenty of right now. You saw the maps the other day where we put up the different sites in various states and virtually all states are like that. How about you with the mask?"
2020-04-22,01:11:23,Unnamed,"Yes, and Mr. President, may I actually follow up on those maps from the other day? On Monday, a reporter for a local television station in Miami sent me a question asking if it was possible to get the information on those maps distributed to the media so that local TV stations and newspapers can check on that information? So, if that could be done?"
2020-04-22,01:11:49,Donald Trump,Do you want to do that? Do you want to say something?
2020-04-22,01:11:54,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Sorry. Thank you for talking about testing and testing capacity because we have been talking about that for several weeks because we could see and we did a full inventory of every single state and every single laboratory. And I also appreciate you talking about the implementation piece of the testing capacity and it’s complicated. So, we have a team calling every lab and working through the American Society of Microbiology, as I mentioned before, to really work with every lab director to see what the issues are in each laboratory. And I just want to thank administrator Burma who really worked on increasing the funding for this test and uniquely doubling the funding for the coronavirus nucleic acid test, from $50 to $100. To really address some of the issues about laboratory technicians, because sometimes we think these tests run themselves, they don’t. They actually need people to help with the machines."
2020-04-22,01:12:56,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So, we were talking about purchasing more machines. We actually need to have additional laboratory technicians to really be able to work all of those machines. And so, it’s lab by lab, state by state, and that’s the dialogue that’s going on now to unlock the full potential of the United States. Maybe the testing would not be needed at this moment, and maybe it is, but we want it also totally available in the Fall if it comes to an issue where we have to distinguish between flu and COVID-19. So, we’re building infrastructure and capacity not only for today but for tomorrow, and really showing a new way to really deal with pandemics and bring testing to scale because the country has never had to do this before. If you look at some of the other countries, they’re struggling with some of the issues from PPE to testing. And so, this is a universal issue, but we’re working on it as a collective to really have a very innovated and integrated way to approach testing."
2020-04-22,01:13:54,Donald Trump,"But without building new, they have tremendous capability."
2020-04-22,01:13:58,Dr. Deborah Birx,"And the maps are… I will ask the companies, because obviously it’s proprietary where every single machine is and if you have that machine and five others, maybe you don’t want to let that person know you have five others. It’s like Coke and Pepsi. So, I think we’re working very deliberately to really be able to share those maps. The governors, I can tell you that all of the state governors and the mayors have those maps and the addresses and the type of machine for every single laboratory in their jurisdictions so that they know-"
2020-04-22,01:14:32,Donald Trump,And I believe the governors were not aware that those laboratories were available.
2020-04-22,01:14:38,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:14:38] on the state of California is now partially broken with CDC restrictions on who will get guidance and who should get testing because they want to test people without any symptoms at all in high risk environments like a nursing home. Do you agree with this? Question for Pence, do you agree-"
2020-04-22,01:14:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Well, not only do we agree with it, it was in our guidelines."
2020-04-22,01:15:00,John (Reporter),"Our guidelines, yeah."
2020-04-22,01:15:00,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That was fundamental to our guidelines, and I think we were the first-"
2020-04-22,01:15:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,
2020-04-22,01:15:03,Dr. Deborah Birx,"That was fundamental to our guidelines and I think we were the first group that said testing asymptomatics will be key. We’ve always said that we think that’s a significant contribution to infections, and we went to the places where we thought it was most critical to find cases the earliest. And so, that is where we have asked states, in the guidelines, to start with nursing home, indigenous peoples and people in underserved areas and cities, to really ensure that we’re monitoring for any type… Because we know the asymptomatic piece may be the tip of the iceberg, in fact be the iceberg underneath the surface. And so, if you’re only seeing cases, maybe this…"
2020-04-22,01:15:41,Dr. Deborah Birx,"But in parallel, we’re working with states and local governments to really define what that population is, by doing… In collaboration with states, working with them together to really reinforce this antibody testing but in a careful way, where you do two antibody testing to increase your sensitivity and specificity into the 99 plus percent range. Because we think it’s really important that you have a very high quality test, but a high quality test that you can really tell someone that they’ve had this before. And so, we’re waiting to have those two tests that we can do in series to really assure people. But that is… That was in the guidelines from the very beginning, and we think it’s fundamental both for right now and going through the fall. Because that will be our early alert, if any of other COVID virus reappears."
2020-04-22,01:16:28,Unnamed,How much more testing [crosstalk 00:01:16:29]?
2020-04-22,01:16:29,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 01:16:29] you didn’t that was on the guidelines.

2020-04-22,01:16:34,Donald Trump,"I know, but it’s right on the guidelines."
2020-04-22,01:16:37,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, why are there… Can I just-"
2020-04-22,01:16:39,Donald Trump,"I’m surprised with you. [inaudible 01:16:39] would you like to say something on it, please?"
2020-04-22,01:16:44,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. And I just want to reiterate to everyone that the task force and the administration have a commitment to protecting vulnerable people. And that includes, in the area of testing. We’ve had the opportunity to talk to many different groups and we hear that testing is absolutely a concern. And we’ll be giving you more details in the coming days, but I just want you to know that we’re building on the public private partnership that the president rolled out with pharmacy and retail companies like CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Walmart and Kroger, to accelerate testing for more Americans and more communities across the nation. We’re going to be increasing access to testing for under-tested, underserved and minority communities, and we’re working closely with partners and states to establish sites and areas most in need of increased access to testing. We’re using data. CDC, provided data to locate sites and counties that are under tested and socially vulnerable, especially with high populations of Black, Hispanic, rural and Native Americans."
2020-04-22,01:17:49,Unnamed,"We’re using the CDC’s vulnerability index, as you heard about earlier, to select sites. This measures the resilience of communities when confronted by external stressors along four main themes, socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and housing type. Our goal is to have about two third of these initial sites located in counties with moderate to high social vulnerability, and about a quarter of these sites and counties with high social vulnerability. So again, I want communities that are vulnerable to understand that we are strategically and intentionally making sure we’re deploying testing in those areas, so that people can get identified if they have symptoms, can get identified if they are asymptomatic, and that we will be able to deploy resources appropriately."
2020-04-22,01:18:39,Donald Trump,"Thank you, [crosstalk 01:18:40]."
2020-04-22,01:18:39,Unnamed,Just a quick follow-up for Dr. Birx.
2020-04-22,01:18:39,Donald Trump,"I’m got to have to say our Surgeon General is doing a great job, thank you."
2020-04-22,01:18:45,Unnamed,Thank you.
2020-04-22,01:18:45,Donald Trump,"Really good. [inaudible 00:03:47], in the middle."
2020-04-22,01:18:48,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you. Can we talk about Iran? You put out a message this morning making a rather big announcement for our military when it comes to Iranian aggression. Are you going to change formally rules of engagement for our U.S. military so that they can engage?"
2020-04-22,01:19:08,Donald Trump,"We’re covered 100%. We don’t want their gunboats surrounding our boats and traveling around our boats and having a good time, we don’t want them anywhere near our boats, and… So you know the order I gave, I don’t think you have to say it again, but I’ve given that order. Under the Obama administration, it was taking place all the time. Under my administration, I gave this order early on and nothing happened. They were very nice, there was no problem. But then I noticed yesterday they did that in a much lighter form, but they did that again. I said, “We’re not going to stand for it.” So if they do that, that’s putting our ships at danger and our great crews and sailors in danger, I’m not going to let that happen. And we will… They’ll shoot them out of the water."
2020-04-22,01:19:51,Unnamed,The U.S. military does not have to change its rules of engagement in order to follow your [crosstalk 00:01:19:56]?
2020-04-22,01:19:56,Donald Trump,"No, that’s the rules of engagement. That’s a threat. When they get that close to our boat, and they have guns, they have very substantial weapons on those boats, but we’ll shoot them out of the water. Please."
2020-04-22,01:20:07,Unnamed,"Thank you, President Trump. If possible, I’d like to ask a question to Dr. Fauci, and then a very different one to you. To Dr. Fauci, today the CDC and the USDA said that the first pets in America had tested positive for the coronavirus, what does that mean and what should the public know about that?"
2020-04-22,01:20:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Pets?
2020-04-22,01:20:23,Unnamed,"Pets, two pets."
2020-04-22,01:20:25,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"So that question was asked before, but I’d be happy to answer it again. Certainly, animals, pets, can get infected. Big cats in zoos have been reported to be infected with coronavirus. There’s no evidence that the virus is transmitted from a pet to a human. Now obviously, is that impossible? I mean, biologicall anything is possible. But, there is no evidence whatsoever, that we’ve seen from an epidemiological standpoint, that pets can be transmitters within the household. So, it’s not surprising. I mean, we… When you have viruses that can infect multiple species, isolating it from an animal doesn’t necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it."
2020-04-22,01:21:10,Donald Trump,What about the lion in the New York zoo?
2020-04-22,01:21:12,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yeah. Well, that’s the lion [inaudible 01:21:13]."
2020-04-22,01:21:13,Donald Trump,How did that happen?
2020-04-22,01:21:15,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"It probably happened… I don’t know, Mr. President. But I would imagine that one of the zookeepers probably had an asymptomatic infection, took care of the animal, gave him some food, touched them or whatever, and that’s how he got it."
2020-04-22,01:21:28,Unnamed,"Thank you. And President Trump my question for you is, earlier in these briefings you talked a lot about giving Americans hope and you wanted to focus on that, but now that the crisis seems to perhaps be lessening, I wanted to ask you about accountability. And of course, millions of Americans became familiar with you as the tough boss who fired people for doing a poor job. I wanted to ask you about two specific things. There was a report from Reuters today, that the HHS Secretary, put a former dog breeder in charge of day to day coronavirus efforts, to begin with. And also on-"
2020-04-22,01:22:05,Donald Trump,What?
2020-04-22,01:22:05,Unnamed,"Reuters reported today that, Alex Azar, the secretary HHS, put a former dog breeder, that was his most recently former job, in charge of day to day operations of the coronavirus."
2020-04-22,01:22:16,Donald Trump,"That I don’t about, [inaudible 01:22:18] just telling me something. And what’s the second?"
2020-04-22,01:22:20,Unnamed,"And the second one is on face masks. Taiwan has a bigger population than New York State. Early on, they had universal wearing of face masks. Here-"
2020-04-22,01:22:29,Donald Trump,"No problem with face masks, if the governors want to do that. We ordered, I don’t know if you know, 500 million face masks, we have hundreds of millions right now. And if people want to wear them, that’s up to the governors. If the governors want that, that’s up to them. Now it’s more appropriate in some states, obviously, than others. You have the big planes and you have certain states where it’s much less necessary. But, that’s up to the governors and we have that very well covered, I think, face masks, right?"
2020-04-22,01:22:54,Unnamed,"Here, people are wearing masks."
2020-04-22,01:22:55,Donald Trump,"We have hundreds of millions of face masks, and we have at least 500 million, that’s a lot. We’ll have them very shortly."
2020-04-22,01:23:04,Unnamed,"Lot’s of people are wearing face masks now that the federal government advised, it was almost overnight. But less than a month ago, our Surgeon General said that, and I’m quoting their quote, “Not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus.” I mean, is… Should there be accountability there and also for the HHS Secretary?"
2020-04-22,01:23:23,Donald Trump,"Well, I don’t know. Would anybody like to speak about it? I don’t… I think if… Just so you understand, if somebody wants to wear them, I’m all for it. Would somebody like to discuss that?"
2020-04-22,01:23:31,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"Yes. Go for it, boss."
2020-04-22,01:23:36,Unnamed,"I think the comments that we made when we came into face masks, and I think it’s important, when we came out with the CDC guidance about face masks or what we called face coverings, was in recognition of the growing understanding of asymptomatic infection or presymptomatic infection, was the recognition that we could use a barrier, and the reason… And I have mine when I’m in public right here, that I use. That this barrier, in case I was in fact infected if I didn’t know, is a barrier to prevent me to protect you in case I happened to be asymptomatically infected. There’s very good data to show that the ability of viral particles to go through a barrier is substantially diminished. And that’s why we recommended these face coverings, I think if you go back to when CDC came out with that recommendation. Some people may think intuitively it’s to protect them from getting infected. No, it was to protect you from potentially getting infected by me when I go out in public. [inaudible 01:24:46]."
2020-04-22,01:24:45,Donald Trump,[inaudible 01:24:47].
2020-04-22,01:24:50,Unnamed,"I actually appreciate you asking that question because it’s one that we’ve had to clarify several times, and I understand why the American public has been confused over time. As Dr Redfield mentioned, initially we said based on CDC, World Health Organization and most other major public health organizations, that the public needed to know that these masks were not effective or shown to be effective in preventing you if you wear a mask from catching coronavirus. Another important thing to remember in the context of those statements, was a run on medical masks, on N95 masks, and our healthcare workers were at risk. What’s changed? What’s changed is, we found out that unlike past viruses that are spread through the respiratory route, a significant proportion of coronavirus cases can be traced back to asymptomatic spread. So, the task force deliberated this, we’ve always told you that we will look at the facts and we will give people recommendations based on the best available evidence at the time."
2020-04-22,01:25:51,Unnamed,"And once we saw that asymptomatic spread, we said, “Well, masks still aren’t effective.” And from our point of view, at preventing you from catching coronavirus in a significant way. But we’ve always told people that they should wear masks if they know they have symptoms to prevent them from spreading to other people. Well, now that we know about 25 to 50% of people are spreading asymptomatically, we suggested people wear cloth facial coverings to prevent asymptomatic spread. You wear your mask, to protect me. I wear my mask, and Dr Redfield mentioned it… I’ve got my mask, I believe I have mine on me, Bob. I carry mine around with me too. I wear my mask to protect you. We’re six feet away, which is why I’m not wearing my mask to protect you now. And we also all have been tested, so that’s why I’m not wearing mine now."
2020-04-22,01:26:41,Donald Trump,"Yeah, but I’m still next to you."
2020-04-22,01:26:41,Unnamed,"Well, I’ll put mine on if you want me to, sir."
2020-04-22,01:26:43,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:11:43].
2020-04-22,01:26:44,Unnamed,"But again, important to know that if you’re going to wear a mask, it’s not a substitute for social distancing. Still, social distancing is the number one thing you can do. Number two, it’s important to know that you should practice good hand hygiene and not touch your face, because you still could touch a surface and bring disease to your face. And number three, is the most important… Well, it’s just as important. Please, save the medical mask, the N95, for the healthcare workers, because the cloth facial coverings are effective as far as we know right now, based on the best available evidence, at preventing you from spreading disease to other people. So, no inconsistency there. It’s just, the recommendation changed because the information changed, and that’s what you want from your public health leaders."
2020-04-22,01:27:28,Unnamed,"So, no argument made that you do about asymptomatic transmission at the time that you said that, and that you were essentially misleading the public?"
2020-04-22,01:27:35,Unnamed,"Well, I…"
2020-04-22,01:27:35,Donald Trump,Please answer that question.
2020-04-22,01:27:38,Unnamed,"The honest answer to you is, no, we did not. That was the recommendation of the World Health Organization and the CDC, and we gave you the best information we could at the time. So, I actually a little bit resent that implication, because I work hard to try to protect the American people and we are always going to give the American people the best information we have available at the time."
2020-04-22,01:28:01,Unnamed,And we don’t-
2020-04-22,01:28:02,Unnamed,"We’re humble enough to say, “look, if we don’t know we’re going to change. We’re going to change with recommendations.”"
2020-04-22,01:28:06,Donald Trump,"Just always got a question, that’s all. Please, go ahead."
2020-04-22,01:28:09,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the launch of the military satellite by Iran, wanted to get your response to that. Do you see this as an advancement of the missile program?"
2020-04-22,01:28:19,Donald Trump,"You mean the shot they took? Well, they say no. They say all sorts… It was for television. Does anybody really believe that? They wouldn’t have better television in Iran. So, they said no. We’re watching Iran very closely. We know more about… [inaudible 00:13:36]."
2020-04-22,01:28:38,Unnamed,"Military readiness. The outbreak on the Roosevelt, the fact that you’re consumed with dealing with coronavirus here in the United States."
2020-04-22,01:28:40,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:13:42]. Various navies have had outbreaks of COVID. Look, we’re in 184 different nations right now. 184 with COVID. No, we have a problem on… That just shows you how rapidly it spreads. It started off with two sailors, and then 10 sailors, and 20, and now I hear it’s 540. Of which, one has died and a few were very sick, but most of them are back in great shape. But, you did… We did lose one, and it attacked the lungs of that young person. And then, we also had a number that were quite sick, but they’re all either better or getting better, but most of them are better for a long time already. Please."
2020-04-22,01:29:22,Unnamed,"Mr. President, can I-"
2020-04-22,01:29:22,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:14:25].
2020-04-22,01:29:23,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, over the course of the past few weeks, there have been the closures of several meat processing companies across the country and several states."
2020-04-22,01:29:34,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-04-22,01:29:35,Unnamed,Is this a concern to you?
2020-04-22,01:29:36,Donald Trump,"Yeah, of course."
2020-04-22,01:29:37,Unnamed,Are you going to increase testing in these facilities [crosstalk 00:14:39]?
2020-04-22,01:29:41,Donald Trump,"Yeah. Look at South Dakota, how well the governor has done there, and all of a sudden you have a big spike in one location and she’s got that very much under control as you know, but nevertheless, that was surprising and they had a big one right near where you were yesterday, as I understand it. And… So, we’re concerned about that. They’re closing one or two of the plants, actually."
2020-04-22,01:30:00,Unnamed,Is the food supply secure?
2020-04-22,01:30:02,Donald Trump,"Yes, totally secure. It’s in great shape. At the back [inaudible 01:30:05]."
2020-04-22,01:30:09,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. [inaudible 01:30:08], the attorney general in the State of Missouri, filed a law case against-"
2020-04-22,01:30:14,Donald Trump,Against China.
2020-04-22,01:30:16,Unnamed,… China. Accusing it of lying and covering up about the origin of the virus. Do you support that? And do you [crosstalk 01:30:22] a national-
2020-04-22,01:30:22,Donald Trump,"Well, I haven’t seen the case. I know about the case. He filed the case against China. I love Missouri, as you know, it’s great. But I’m going to take a look at it. I actually know about it very much. I have to take a look at… I have not seen the case in terms of reading it, but I will be doing that."
2020-04-22,01:30:38,Unnamed,[inaudible 01:30:38] for international investigation.
2020-04-22,01:30:40,Donald Trump,"We’re going to have to take a look. Oh, we’re doing investigations, we’re doing our own. But I do want to see and review that lawsuit. I’m sure that won’t be the last one."
2020-04-22,01:30:48,Unnamed,"I just a had follow-up question for Dr. Fauci, if you don’t mind."
2020-04-22,01:30:51,Donald Trump,"Yeah, sure."
2020-04-22,01:30:51,Unnamed,"But, I’m happy to ask you one after. So, John had asked the president about Rick Bright, and he said he wasn’t sure who that was, but I’m sure you’re familiar with who he is, since he was the head of BARDA. So, there’s concern or an accusation, he’s raised, that he was removed from his job because he protested widespread use of hydroxychloroquine. Are you familiar with this situation? And, do you feel like public health experts feel they are able to speak publicly or to speak out in opposition to certain things?"
2020-04-22,01:31:22,Dr. Anthony Fauci,Here I am.
2020-04-22,01:31:24,Unnamed,"Yeah. So, you don’t feel like there’s any concern among people at the NIH right now or in the public health [crosstalk 01:31:29]?"
2020-04-22,01:31:30,Dr. Anthony Fauci,At the NIH? Absolutely not.
2020-04-22,01:31:33,Unnamed,"Dr. Fauci, knowing Dr. Bright and knowing what his gifts are, as one of the country’s leading experts on vaccines, are those gifts best suited at NIH rather than BARDA? What’s he going to be doing with you?"
2020-04-22,01:31:46,Dr. Anthony Fauci,What is he going to be doing at the NIH?
2020-04-22,01:31:49,Unnamed,"So first of all, are his gifts best suited to work with you rather than BARDA?"
2020-04-22,01:31:54,Dr. Anthony Fauci,"No, I can’t… I don’t really think I can comment on somebody’s relative gifts. I mean, he’s going to be at the NIH and he’s going to be responsible, from what I hear. Again, this is what I’ve heard, that he’s going to be responsible for the development of diagnostics, which is very important. The NIH is going to be involved in trying to develop new generation diagnostics, which we feel is going to be very important for the future of being able to facilitate the kinds of things that now are sometimes problematic."
2020-04-22,01:32:26,Unnamed,Are you concerned at all that he-
2020-04-22,01:32:26,Donald Trump,And why do you say he has great gifts or gifts? What? Do you know him?
2020-04-22,01:32:29,Unnamed,[inaudible 00:17:29].
2020-04-22,01:32:29,Donald Trump,"No, I know. But, have you reviewed him?"
2020-04-22,01:32:31,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:32:31] resume, he’s working-"
2020-04-22,01:32:31,Donald Trump,Have you studied him? Have you reported on him? You said his gifts. I mean-
2020-04-22,01:32:36,Unnamed,He’s worked his entire career developing vaccines including the [crosstalk 01:32:41].
2020-04-22,01:32:37,Donald Trump,"Well, that doesn’t mean you have gifts. I know a lot of people that play baseball, but they can’t hit 150 in the Major Leagues."
2020-04-22,01:32:43,Unnamed,"Well, he helped develop the flu vaccine, last year."
2020-04-22,01:32:45,Donald Trump,"No, but you talk about his great gifts. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-22,01:32:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you so much-"
2020-04-22,01:32:49,Donald Trump,"Please, go ahead. You could go. Please."
2020-04-22,01:32:51,Unnamed,"Thank you, sir. I have two questions, one for myself and then one for a colleague of ours who could not be here today because of social distancing."
2020-04-22,01:32:58,Donald Trump,From where?
2020-04-22,01:32:59,Unnamed,"I’m with, USA today. First, the Executive Director of The National Association of Counties said today, that The White House did not want to see money for local… State and the local governments in the latest COVID assistance package."
2020-04-22,01:33:14,Donald Trump,"[inaudible 00:01:33:14], want to say what? What does that mean?"
2020-04-22,01:33:16,Unnamed,I’m sorry.
2020-04-22,01:33:17,Donald Trump,What does that mean? Repeat it. Say it a little differently.
2020-04-22,01:33:20,Unnamed,"The Executive Director of The National Association of Counties said today, that The White House objected to putting funding for state and local governments into the latest COVID assistance package."
2020-04-22,01:33:31,Donald Trump,"Oh, really. That’s… Is he a Democrat?"
2020-04-22,01:33:33,Unnamed,"I do not know, sir."
2020-04-22,01:33:34,Donald Trump,"Well, check it. How could you ask that question without knowing? Check it out, you’ll find out."
2020-04-22,01:33:37,Unnamed,I’ll check it out.
2020-04-22,01:33:38,Donald Trump,Okay. What’s your next question?
2020-04-22,01:33:39,Unnamed,He says… His question was-
2020-04-22,01:33:40,Donald Trump,"You know the numbers, you know the money we put into states, local governments, everything else, and they have to be responsible for their own finances, but you check it out. Go ahead. What’s the next…"
2020-04-22,01:33:50,Unnamed,"[crosstalk 01:33:50] he said that you said that you felt like that this would somehow be a disincentive or [inaudible 01:33:55], is he correct about that?"
2020-04-22,01:33:58,Donald Trump,How would he know what I felt? I never spoke to him. I don’t even know who he is.
2020-04-22,01:34:00,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:34:00].
2020-04-22,01:34:01,Donald Trump,You don’t know who he is either.
2020-04-22,01:34:02,Unnamed,"Yes. His name is Matthew Chase, sir."
2020-04-22,01:34:04,Donald Trump,"Okay. It doesn’t help me and it doesn’t help you. Go ahead, Jeff."
2020-04-22,01:34:10,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, also-"
2020-04-22,01:34:11,Donald Trump,"Do we want to keep going [inaudible 01:34:12] or not? You’re not going to say, “Oh, he took questions all night long.”"
2020-04-22,01:34:15,Unnamed,"No, sir."
2020-04-22,01:34:16,Donald Trump,Okay. Right?
2020-04-22,01:34:17,Unnamed,[inaudible 01:34:17].
2020-04-22,01:34:19,Donald Trump,"Okay. Well good, how many questions can you have? Go ahead."
2020-04-22,01:34:20,Jeff (Reporter),… also-
2020-04-22,01:34:21,Donald Trump,"We all have fun, because we’re talking about something very important. The main thing is, I think we’re getting to a lot of solutions. We never want this to happen again. We never want this to happen again, what happened. And if it should come back in some form, we want to snuff it out very quickly before anything can happen. And I personally hope it doesn’t come back in the fall, as a combination of the flu or not as a combination of the flu. But I think we learned a lot. And some of these questions are good, some of them are ridiculous frankly, but some of them are very… I think some of them are very important questions. Very important. When you asked Dr. Fauci about the right to speak, if I let him speak, I’ll let anybody speak. And we love him. Let’s go."
2020-04-22,01:35:06,Jeff (Reporter),"Mr. President, Senator-"
2020-04-22,01:35:07,Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:20:07].
2020-04-22,01:35:08,Jeff (Reporter),…. McConnell said today that he would prefer to see states that have high public pensions declare bankruptcy rather than taking on more federal bailout money.
2020-04-22,01:35:17,Donald Trump,"I heard he said that… I don’t know what he said, I’ll have to call him and ask him."
2020-04-22,01:35:23,Jeff (Reporter),That’s what he said.
2020-04-22,01:35:24,Donald Trump,"Well, that’s okay. I’m going to have to look at it directly."
2020-04-22,01:35:27,Jeff (Reporter),Would you agree with him on that? Or-
2020-04-22,01:35:28,Donald Trump,"I can tell you that. I have to see… I want to base it on fact and reason. I want to see what he said, why he said it, and how he said it. I’d have to watch him say it. But, some of the states are not doing well, let’s face it. And some are doing phenomenally well, a state where Mike was governor. Indiana, I looked at their numbers, they have… It’s incredible what they’re doing. Some states are doing fantastically well. Iowa is doing great. You have states doing well and you have some states that aren’t doing well. We know the ones… I don’t have to mention the ones that aren’t doing well, but you do have states that are in trouble. And certainly, they’re coming back to talk to us. We’ll see what happens."
2020-04-22,01:36:07,Jeff (Reporter),"Are you concerned, sir, about the growing US national debt as a result of these stimulus packages?"
2020-04-22,01:36:12,Donald Trump,"Oh, we have no choice. Do we have a choice? I’m always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem. This was… We were attacked. This was an attack. This wasn’t just OG, and this wasn’t the flu, by the way. They like to say the flu. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. 1917, was the last time. We were attacked… We had the greatest economy in the history of the world, we had the greatest economy… Better than China, better than any place, they will tell you that. I dealt with them for a long time and they will you, the greatest economy, we built it in the last three years, three and a half years, we built it. And then one day, they came and they said, “You have to close it.” I said, “You got to be…” These people right here, they said, “You have to… They came into my office, into The Oval Office, and they said, “We have to close the economy.” I said, ” Let’s explain this. Explain this to me.” The greatest ever in history, and we had to close it."
2020-04-22,01:37:07,Donald Trump,"Now we’re going to open it again and we’re going to be just as strong or stronger, but you have to spend some money to get it back open. We saved our airlines. We just as finished up with the airlines. We saved numerous companies that are great companies. That two months ago we’re having the best year they’ve ever had, now all of a sudden they’re totally shut out of markets. There was a great spirit today. The fact is some of the governors are opening up their states. And I saw it, I feel it. I don’t know if you folks know, I feel it. There was a great spirit today. I don’t know, the stock market was up today, I guess. It was up quite a bit when I just walked out here. And I will say, I feel much different today than I did two or three days ago. And I think the world does. We spoke to a lot of leaders. The world feels that we’re really leading a path of optimism."
2020-04-22,01:38:01,Donald Trump,"European Union is having a lot of difficulty. You take a look at what’s going on with the European Union, it’s having tremendous difficulty. But we’re going to be back and we’re going to be back stronger than ever, we’re going to be at a level, I think, that everybody is going to be look… And they do. They look up to us. They want to know, what are we doing? What are we doing with therapeutics? What are we doing with vaccines? We’re going to have those answers too. We’re going to have them. Just like we took care of ventilators, just like we’re taking care of and already, as we said a hundred times, we had more testing than any nation in the world."
2020-04-22,01:38:33,Donald Trump,"We had more testing than all of those nations put together, that we mentioned the other day, all of them put together. And we’re going to be within two weeks at a level that nobody has ever even seen before. They’ve never seen where we are right now. You don’t have to build new machines, you don’t have to build new labs, we already have them. But some of the labs are even upgrading to be able to double and triple their capacity, in one case. Now we’re at a level that nobody has ever been. We’re going to be bigger, better and stronger than ever before. So, I’m not concerned about that. Thank you very much."
2020-04-23,03:26,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Later this evening, we expect the house to pass Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. I’m grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses. At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll. You see, states are starting to open up now and it’s very exciting to see. I think, it’s very awe inspiring. We’re coming out of it and we’re coming out of it well, and we’re… Really, I’m very happy the governors have been… The governors really have been doing a really good job working with us and it’s really pretty impressive to see. I’ve spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying, we’re leading the way. We’re really leading the way in so many different ways."
2020-04-23,04:32,Donald Trump,"I’m also very pleased at Harvard as you know. As Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and college as also large businesses, have sent funds back to us. And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at. And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it’s about $350 million, and they’ve either not gone out or we’ve renegotiated it and they’re not getting them. So, it’s a couple of cases, they’re sending them back and sending them back immediately. So, I think it was very nice. I want to thank Harvard in particular, they acted very quickly and decisively. And they agreed when they heard the facts that they should not be getting it. So, we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and other institutions. The bill also includes, $30 billion to support small lending institutions, serving distress communities, helping countless African Americans and Hispanic Americans, small businesses."
2020-04-23,05:37,Donald Trump,"As we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggests that we’re making great progress. In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak week. 40% of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases. 46 states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus like symptoms. That’s a big number. To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance and we all understand that very well. We’ve gone over it many times. This includes, practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance and the voluntary use of face covering. Safe and phased reopening of our economy, it’s very exciting, but does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all in any way. On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy, to get our country back to work, to take our country back. We’re winning this, and we’re going to win it. And we’re going to keep watching, and we’re going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy."
2020-04-23,06:44,Donald Trump,"With each passing day, we’re learning more and more about this enemy. The scientists at DHS, have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces. The findings confirmed that the virus survives better in colder and drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments. I have to say that very excitingly, we’re going to have somebody up… Bill, will be up in just a little while, that was a great report you gave. And he’s going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight. And when you hear the numbers, you won’t even believe them. US trials of the COVID-19 have been going on and have been approved in the United States, Germany, UK and China, that’s big news. And we’re… A lot of trials are going on, and we have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutics."
2020-04-23,07:47,Donald Trump,"We must be careful in all conditions, but we will get this done. We’re very close to a vaccine. Unfortunately, we’re not very close to testing because when the testing starts, it takes a period of time, but we’ll get it done. And I want to thank the head of DHS Science and Technology, Bill Bryan, for what he’s going to be doing and what he’s going to be saying and the report that he’s about to give. I think it’s going to be a something that nobody has ever heard, it would be brand new information and very important information. My administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacturing delivery of critical medical supplies. We finalize three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days. And as you know, we’re also using a sterilization process, some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask."
2020-04-23,08:46,Donald Trump,"So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks, and it’s working very well. We just want the hospitals and the institutions where it is, to use. A lot of people don’t use it. They’re so used to getting a new mask, they don’t want to use it, they want to go and immediately get a new one. We’re asking them to use the sterilization process. Every bit is good. Up to 20 times, think of that. In addition to ramping up our domestic assembly lines, we also have airlifted nearly 750 million pieces of personal protective equipment into the United States through our Project Airbridge, which has been an incredible thing to watch. It’s really a military operation. The vice president is now providing each governor with an exhaustive count by county breakdown of the privately distributed personal protection, and this is equipment and things that are incredible. It’s personal protective equipment."
2020-04-23,09:44,Donald Trump,"It’s incredible and it’s all brand new and at the highest level, we’re getting only the highest level. And also, we’re looking at essential gear within their states, and it’s being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak. This way, the governors should know exactly what’s being delivered through our private sector supply chain within their states as well as through the Project Airbridge. We’re trying to get it immediately from the plane to the state. Where we can’t do that, we bring it into our facilities and get it to the governors. And we’re getting them fast and we’re notifying them very strongly, so they know it’s there. Governors can use this information to quickly ensure that they get materials where and when they are needed. Today, I also want to extend my special thanks to our nation’s incredible County Emergency Management teams, who have been working relentlessly for weeks around the clock, end on end to serve their communities, help distribute critical supplies and save countless American lives. We salute these heroic officials on the front lines."
2020-04-23,10:49,Donald Trump,"As we continue to develop potential therapies, the FDA has recently begun a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donated from the blood of those who have recovered from the virus. The blood of these donors contains antibodies that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who are sick. And frankly, those that are very sick. Nearly 3000 patients are now enrolled in the expanded access program receiving transfusions nationwide, and I want to thank all of the people that recovered for what they’ve done. As I said yesterday, they raise their hand when they barely can walk, and they’re saying, “I want to donate blood, I want to donate whatever it is that you want, because we want to help people.” It’s really quite incredible. Convalescent plasma will also be used to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that does not have to be matched with a particular blood type."
2020-04-23,11:48,Donald Trump,"This concentrated antibody treatment could be used as a preventative measure to keep healthcare workers and other high risk populations from contracting the virus in the first place. Very big deal. Clinical trials of these products are slated to begin within weeks and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution. I urge Americans to get in there and keep doing what you’re doing. Because again, we want those people recovering or recovered from coronavirus, to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help, and they’ve been so great and I just appreciate it. My administration has also partnered with the leading… And we have really been establishing some great partnerships with leading technology companies and scientific journals, to create a database of 52,000 scholarly articles on the virus that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. Top AI experts are now using this wealth of data to gain insights into potential therapies, and we’re collaborating with tech firms, universities and our national labs, to harness American supercomputers in the search for treatments and vaccines."
2020-04-23,12:59,Donald Trump,"That search is going on and it’s being… I think you’ll see in the future, you’ll see it’s very successful. Ultimately, it’ll be a tremendous success. Great progress is being made at a rapid pace, a pace like no other. We have every hope that with the full might and resources of American science and technology and with the courage and devotion of the American people who have been so incredible, we will end this plague and together we will restore the full measure of American strength and power and prosperity. Our country is going to do fantastically well. You see what’s going on. There is a pent-up demand in our country to get it back right where it was and maybe even better. And that’s what’s going to happen. So with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up. Vice president, say a few words. Please, Mike."
2020-04-23,13:49,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. And good afternoon. Today, The White House Coronavirus Task Force met. And while our hearts are with the families of those who have lost their life to the coronavirus and those who are struggling with serious illness today, our team led by Dr. Deborah Birx, informs us that the data continues to show promising signs of progress. The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans, all appear to be past their peak. And we are seeing consistent declines in hospitalization and cases in regions across the country. Our only conclusion is that we’re getting there, America. Because the American people have put into practice the president’s guidelines of social distancing, because you’ve been listening and adhering to the guidance of state and local officials. We’re making meaningful progress. In a very real sense, sparing Americans not to be exposed to the coronavirus and in no less extent, saving lives."
2020-04-23,14:59,Mike Pence,"Our task force actually believes, Mr. President, that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead, as states implement their policies including phased reopening that will preserve those gains, we do believe by early summer we could be in a much better place as a nation. With much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us. Earlier today, we also had a conference call led by Secretary Ben Carson and leaders from HUD about, the president’s announcement yesterday, that he is repurposing The White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, to focus on the impact of the coronavirus on minority communities. Secretary Carson, will convene the council tomorrow, and we’ll be reporting tomorrow afternoon on their progress. We want to thank, more than 270 leaders of organizations dedicated to housing, homelessness and improving the lives of people across our urban communities. Not only for being with us today, for the way they have partnered with our administration and partnered with state and local officials to put the health of all of their constituencies first."
2020-04-23,16:11,Mike Pence,"As the president mentioned, we’ll… You’ll receive a report that our task force received formally this week from Bill Bryan, of The Science and Technology Directorate, at The Department of Homeland Security. He will outline, as the president said, encouraging news about the impact that heat and sunlight have on the coronavirus, which will increase the confidence that we feel about the coming summer. On the subject of testing, at the present moment, we have reports of 4.93 million tests having been performed across America. And encouraging news as states have been engaging commercial labs at a higher level across the country, yesterday our commercial lab system did more than 100,000 tests in a single day. So, we’re beginning to activate all of the capacity. And tomorrow at the president’s direction, our task force will convene a conference call with all of the nation’s governors, to talk about their progress that they are making on testing."
2020-04-23,17:09,Mike Pence,"And, we’re going to hear from governors about the practices that… And methods that they are employing, to significantly increased testing following our briefing about capacity and laboratories this past Monday. For instance, Governor Mike DeWine, just announced that Ohio’s testing has been greatly expanded after the FDA approved Thermo Fisher’s new extraction reagent. Saying in his words, that the action, ‘probably doubled, maybe even tripled, testing in Ohio virtually overnight’. Governor Tim Waltz of Minnesota, announced along with his state’s healthcare system, the Mayo Clinic and The University of Minnesota, what he described as a breakthrough for rapid widespread testing, able to test more than 20,000 people using a molecular test per day. Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa, launched the Test Iowa Initiative, that will triple…"
2020-04-23,18:03,Mike Pence,"… of Iowa launched the Test Iowa Initiative that will triple testing capacity by partnering with Nomi Health and Domo. She also worked with the University of Iowa hospitals to leverage further capacity, and governor Eric Holcomb and governor Andy Bashir of Indiana and Kentucky respectively, both announced additional drive through testing locations. Our priority has always been to focus first on those impacted by the coronavirus and then on those extraordinary healthcare workers ministering to their needs every day. And I know Mr. president how proud you are that our men and women in uniform have come alongside our healthcare workers in communities most impacted, and I know the American people are proud as well. As of today, FEMA reports that 35,000 National Guard have been deployed across the country to aid in our coronavirus response. Governor Kevin Titt of Ohio actually deployed the National Guard to hospitals across the state to evaluate protective equipment and hospital capacity and report it into state emergency management and FEMA. And governor Greg Abbott of Texas actually mobilized more than 1200 National Guard and 45 teams to provide greater access to testing. Along with the national guard, at the president’s direction today, more than 4,500 active duty military doctors, nurses, and medical assistants have been deployed across the country."
2020-04-23,19:26,Mike Pence,"Yesterday, 1,013 medical professionals in our military were actually deployed to 19 hospitals in seven states to support those amazing healthcare workers. And with 4.4 million more Americans filing for unemployment in the past week, I joined the president in welcoming passage in the House today the Paycheck Protection Program. It’ll support working families, allow small businesses to keep people on the payroll for a period of two months. But it also, as the president requested, included $75 billion to assist hospitals across the country. And in that spirit, the president and I will continue to urge states across the country, given the unique burden on hospitals, we are now encouraging states to restart elective surgeries wherever possible, either statewide or on a county by county basis. We recognize the role elective surgeries play in finances for local hospitals and we’ll be working with states to enable that. In that vein, governor Doug Ducey issued an executive order not long ago allowing elective surgeries beginning May 1 for hospitals that meet certain preparedness criteria, and Indiana’s governor Eric Holcomb is allowing elective clinical procedures to begin on April 21st. Finally, Mr. president, the task force received today our first report on state reopening plans. At the present moment, 16 states have released formal reopening plans. 13 of those were actually released since you unveiled the Opening Up America guidelines to our governors and to the nation last week. And to your point, Mr. president, states are beginning to make those plans and we’re encouraged to see so many states embracing the phased approach to reopening their economies that’s contemplated in our guidelines for opening up America again. For instance, governor Mike Parson of Missouri announced the Show Me Strong Recovery plan, has two initial phases intended to protect the most at risk."
2020-04-23,21:36,Mike Pence,"Governor Tom Wolf announced the plan for Pennsylvania that would begin May 8th, will end the stay at home order for just portions of Pennsylvania, but the plan again requires regions to have fewer than 50 new positive cases per 100,000 for a period of 14 days, and it also lays out a phased reopening roadmap. Governor Kate Brown of Oregon updated their framework for reopening, doing three phases again on a county by county basis and governor Brad Little of Idaho released Rebound Idaho in just the last few days, that will consist of four phases and requires specific criteria that Idaho and businesses need to meet to begin to reopen. Mr. President, with the guidelines to open up America again, states are making plans, and at your direction our task force will continue to work very closely, providing them with the data, providing them with the resources to be able to implement those plans in a safe and responsible way."
2020-04-23,22:36,Mike Pence,"So, with that, let me just end where I began and to say thank you to the American people. The progress that we are seeing is a testament to what all of you have done, to our extraordinary healthcare workers. A partnership between the federal government and to state and local official and I’m confident it’s also owing to the prayers of millions of Americans each and every day. All of that combined, we’re slowing the spread, we’re protecting the most vulnerable, we’re saving lives and every single day we are one day closer to opening up America again. With that, Mr. president, I’d be pleased to call Bill forward. Bill Bryan leads the science and technology directorate at the Department of Homeland Security and now will make a presentation on their recent study."
2020-04-23,23:27,Bill Bryan,"Thank you, Mr. vice president. Thank you, Mr. president, for this opportunity to do this today. Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Bill Bryan and I lead the science and technology directorate at the US Department of Homeland Security. Over the last several months, we’ve intensified the department’s R and D efforts to identify and deliver information that informs our response to COVID-19. S and T is working to identify, develop, deploy and deploy the tools and information to support our response to this crisis. As part of our efforts, we’re leveraging the capabilities of S and T’s National Biodefense Analysis and Counter Measure Center to study the biology of the COVID-19 virus. This center is a high biocontainment laboratory located in Frederick, Maryland. It was established in the early 2000’s in response to the amerithrax attacks and where we study, characterize, analyze and develop countermeasures for biological threats to the homeland."
2020-04-23,24:22,Bill Bryan,"We work closely with the CDC, FDA, HHS, and also our Department of Defense colleagues and many others. Yesterday, I shared the emerging results of our work that we’re doing now with the coronavirus task force and today I would like to share a certain trends that we believe are important. If I may have the first slide please. And while that’s coming up, our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus, both surfaces and in the air. We’ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favorable to the virus. So, let me illustrate with this first slide. If you look to the right, you’ll see that term half-life with a bunch of timestamps on there. First, let me tell you what a half-life is. We don’t measure the virus as far as how long will it live on a surface. We have to measure the decay of the virus in terms of its half-life because we don’t know certain-"
2020-04-23,25:27,Bill Bryan,"… That has a bearing on how long the virus is going to be alive and active. So, we measure it in half-life because half-life doesn’t change. So, if you look at an 18 hour half-life, what you’re basically saying is that every 18 hours the life of the virus is cut in half. So, if you start with 1000 particles of the virus, in 18 hours you’re down to 500, and 18 hours after that you’re down to 250 and so on and so forth. That’s important as I explain the rest of the chart. If you look at the first three lines, when you see the word surface, we’re talking about non porous surfaces. Door handles, stainless steel, and if you look at as the temperature increases as the humidity increases with no sun involved, you can see how drastically the half-life goes down on that virus."
2020-04-23,26:09,Bill Bryan,"So, the virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity. If you look at the fourth line, you inject the sunlight into that, you inject UV rays into that, the same effects on line two as 70 to 75 degrees with 80% humidity on the surface and look at line four but now you inject the sun, the half-life goes from six hours to two minutes. That’s how much of an impact UV rays has on the virus. The last two lines are aerosols, what does it do in the air? We have a very unique capability, I was discussing this with the president prior to coming out, he wanted me to convey it to you on how we do this. I believe we’re the only lab in the country that has this capability, but if you can imagine a five gallon Home Depot bucket, we’re able to take a particle, and this was design developed and designed by our folks at the NBAC. We’re able to take a particle of a virus and suspend it in the air inside of this drum and hit it with various temperatures, various humidity levels, multiple different kinds of environmental conditions to include sunlight. And we’re able to measure the decay of that virus while it’s suspended in the air. This is how we do our aerosol testing."
2020-04-23,27:22,Bill Bryan,"We worked with John Hopkins’ applied physics lab and we actually developed a larger drum to actually do more testing and it’s four times the size of that. So, this is the capability that we bring to this effort. So, in summary, within the conditions we’ve tested today, the virus in droplets of saliva survives best in indoors and dry conditions. The virus does not survive as well in droplets of saliva, and that’s important because a lot of testing being done is not necessarily being done, number one, with the COVID-19 virus and number two, in saliva or respiratory fluids. And thirdly, the virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions. And when you look at that chart, look at the aerosol as you breathe it, you put it in a room, 70 to 75 degrees, 20% humidity, low humidity. Half-life is about an hour, but you get outside and it cuts down to a minute and a half. Very significant difference when it gets hit with UV rays. Mr. president, while there are many unknown links in the COVID-19 transmission chain, we believe these trends can support practical decision making to lower the risks associated with the virus. If I could have my next slide and while that comes up, you’ll see a number of some practical applications."
2020-04-23,28:34,Bill Bryan,"For example, increasing the temperature and humidity of potentially contaminated indoor spaces appears to reduce the stability of the virus, and extra care may be warranted for dry environments that do not have exposure to solar light. We’re also testing disinfectants readily available. We’ve tested bleach, we’ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids and I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes. Isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds and that’s with no manipulation, no rubbing. Just bring it on and leaving it go. You rub it and it goes away even faster. We’re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the COVID-19 virus in saliva. This is not the end of our work. As we continue to characterize this virus and integrate our findings into practical applications to mitigate exposure and transmission. I would like to thank the president, thank the vice president for their ongoing support and leadership to the department and for their work in addressing this pandemic. I would also like to thank the scientists not only in S and T and the NBAC, but to the larger scientific and R and D community. Thank you very much."
2020-04-23,29:46,Donald Trump,"A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that too. Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful. Steve, please."
2020-04-23,30:50,Steve (Reporter),You said that the country will be in a better place by early summer. Does that mean you’re going to need to extend the social distancing guidelines until then?
2020-04-23,30:57,Donald Trump,"Well, we may and we may go beyond that. We’re going to have to see where it is and I think people are going to know. You’re going to know, I’m going to know. I think people are going to know just out of common sense, at some point we won’t have to do that, but until we feel it’s safe, we’re going to be extending."
2020-04-23,31:12,Steve (Reporter),You have 23 States where new cases are on decline. What does that mean about when the country can be safely reopened to a more normal point?
2020-04-23,31:24,Donald Trump,"Yeah. It means we’re going to watch those cases very carefully. I think we’ve all gotten very good at it. We’ve gotten good at tracing. We see where the cases are, where they’re going, and we’re going to be watching it and it’s called containment. At a certain point, we’re going to be able to contain, and when you see this, a lot of people have been talking about summer. Maybe this is one of the reasons. I once mentioned that maybe it does go away with heat and light and people didn’t like that statement very much. The fake news didn’t like it at all and I just threw it out as a suggestion, but it seems like that’s the case because when it’s on a surface that would last for a long time, when that surface is outside, it goes away very quickly. It dies very quickly with the sun. Yeah, go ahead."
2020-04-23,32:09,Unnamed,You said yesterday that you’re going to look into Senator McConnell’s suggestion for allowing states to declare bankruptcy versus the-
2020-04-23,32:16,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we’ll look into it and I have been looking into it. I’ve been talking to a lot of the different senators, but I don’t want to talk about it now. That was a very interesting presentation. Go ahead, Jim."
2020-04-23,32:24,Jim (Reporter),"Well, I wanted to talk about McConnell’s suggestion that aid to the states amounts to a-"
2020-04-23,32:29,Donald Trump,I just told you I’m not talking about it and we’ll talk about it later.
2020-04-23,32:32,Jim (Reporter),Okay.
2020-04-23,32:32,Donald Trump,I’d like to talk about something that right now is of more interest…
2020-04-23,32:36,Unnamed,"May I ask Mr, Bryan a question?"
2020-04-23,32:37,Donald Trump,"Yeah, sure."
2020-04-23,32:42,Unnamed,"Thank you. When you started your presentation, you described this as an emerging result. Does this mean your study is conclusive? Is there more work to do?"
2020-04-23,32:51,Bill Bryan,"We’re continuing with that. For example, on the aerosol side, you notice the figures were 20% humidity. We’re looking at higher humidity levels. We would expect that would even have a greater impact on the virus. We’re looking at other types of disinfectants and so, as a scientific community, we are continuing to study the virus to understand its characteristics."
2020-04-23,33:11,Unnamed,"Mr. Bryan, can you explain why some hot spots we’ve seen in the US are hot and humid, like new Orleans for example?"
2020-04-23,33:19,Bill Bryan,"Let me explain. If you look at the coronavirus as a chain with many links, what we’ve done through our study is we’ve identified some of the weak links in that chain that the transmission of the virus depends upon. We identified that heat and humidity is a weakness in that chain. We’ve identified that sunlight, solar light, UV rays is a weakness in that chain. That doesn’t take away the other activities, the guidance from the white house, the guidance from the CDC and others on the actions and steps that people need to take to protect themselves. This is just another tool in our tool belt, right? Another weapon in the fight that we can add to it and in the summer we know that summer light conditions are going to create an environment where the transmission can be decreased and that’s an opportunity for us to get ahead."
2020-04-23,34:05,Jim (Reporter),"The president mentioned the idea of a cleaner, bleach and isopropyl alcohol emerging. There’s no scenario where that could be injected into a person, is there?"
2020-04-23,34:16,Bill Bryan,"No, I’m here to talk about the finds that we had in the study. We don’t do that within that lab at our labs."
2020-04-23,34:22,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:34:22] It wouldn’t be through injections, [inaudible 00:34:25] almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t work, but it certainly has a big affect if it’s on a stationary object."
2020-04-23,34:35,Unnamed,"Mr. Bryan, are we simplifying too much by saying that it’d be better with the warmer weather and the sun coming out more and more, that people would be outside than staying inside their home, confining to the four walls of their house?"
2020-04-23,34:49,Bill Bryan,"It would be irresponsible for us to say that we feel that the summer is just going to totally kill the virus and then if it’s a free for all and that people ignore those guidance, that is not the case. We have an opportunity though to get ahead with what we know now and factor that into the decision makings for what opens and what doesn’t."
2020-04-23,35:06,Donald Trump,"He’s saying on surfaces, the heat, the hot summer and whatever other conditions, humidity and lack of humidity, that that would have an impact. So, that on surfaces where it can be picked up, it will die fairly quickly in the summer. Whereas, in the winter it wouldn’t die so quickly."
2020-04-23,35:24,Bill Bryan,"Yes, Mr. president, when it’s exposed to UV rays, take a playground equipment for example, the UV ray’s hitting a piece of playground equipment will kill the virus when it hits on the playground equipment. But underneath where the sun does not get, if someone touched that and had it on their hands, it could still be there, right? It has to be in direct light of the UV rays."
2020-04-23,35:42,Donald Trump,"Well, if it’s on somebody’s hands, right? And they haven’t touched their face and all of that-"
2020-04-23,35:47,Bill Bryan,"And it’s exposed to the sun, it’ll-"
2020-04-23,35:49,Donald Trump,"I know, but if they’re outside, right, and their hands are exposed to the sun, will that kill it as though it were a piece of metal or something else?"
2020-04-23,35:56,Bill Bryan,"I don’t want to say it will at the same rate because it’s a non-porous surface, but what we do know is-"
2020-04-23,36:03,Bill Bryan,"Same rate because it’s a non-porous surface, but we do know, what we do know is that we looked at the worst case scenario, and the virus lives longer on non-porous surfaces. So porous surfaces, it doesn’t live quite as long, so in theory what you said is correct."
2020-04-23,36:14,Donald Trump,"This is sort [inaudible 00:36:14] on pores, this, right?"
2020-04-23,36:16,Bill Bryan,"Yes, Mr. President. [crosstalk 00:36:18]"
2020-04-23,36:22,Donald Trump,"Wait, wait, wait. Okay, go ahead."
2020-04-23,36:24,Unnamed,"Mr. Bryan, how should governors who are opening their states working on that incorporate the findings of this study into those guidelines?"
2020-04-23,36:31,Bill Bryan,"I would leave that up to the governors. This factors into their decision process. As I mentioned, with knowing this knowledge and having this knowledge as we continue to study and further know what the virus does and how it reacts, it could impact the way a governor will look at what he opens in a state, how he opens it, and what environments these things are opened up. But I’d leave that up to the governors to make that decision. [crosstalk 00:36:52]"
2020-04-23,36:52,Unnamed,"Obviously at the moment the advice is stay at home. By the summer, could we be flipping that and saying you’d be much better off being outside with UV rays or the humidity that Washington brings in August?"
2020-04-23,37:09,Bill Bryan,"I would not go contrary to the guidelines that had been issued right now. I think though to tell you that if I’m having an event with my family, I’m doing it in the driveway or in the backyard, not inside the house."
2020-04-23,37:19,Donald Trump,"With the children. In fact, I’m thinking about moving outside to the Rose Garden now. No, it’s a very interesting question, actually. Okay. Please, go ahead."
2020-04-23,37:26,Unnamed,"Mr. Bryan, how much more research, how much more time would it take to have conclusive results that could be used? You said these were emerging results."
2020-04-23,37:34,Bill Bryan,"We first were able to receive the virus back in February is when we started testing, and it is a science based approach. Science is a process and the doctor can attest to that. It doesn’t necessarily line up with goals and targets and other things. It is what it is. But we are now starting to get results and every week or two weeks, we’re starting to find out something new and something different. And in talking to the task force and the Vice President, he’s already asked us to come to him every time we come up with some new discoveries that we could share to the public."
2020-04-23,38:06,Donald Trump,Bill.
2020-04-23,38:07,Unnamed,"Sir, have you compared notes with your counterparts in other foreign governments or in private industry who might’ve been studying the same thing, and do their findings show the same results that you’ve found here?"
2020-04-23,38:17,Bill Bryan,"We have. We do have a very good partnership with a lot of our allies. We work closely with them on this particular topic. We actually authored a document called The Master Questions List. If you go to DHSS and T’s website, we’ve already had about 17,000 hits on this document. It actually outlines what all the countries in the world are doing to fill the certain gaps of knowledge that don’t exist within the virus, and what we do know, and that is really what targets and drives the science community to say, “All right, what don’t we know now so we don’t duplicate what other people have done?” So we’ve championed that document. It’s well referenced and I would encourage you to look at that."
2020-04-23,38:53,Donald Trump,"And we are working with other countries on vaccines, as you know. Yeah, go ahead, please."
2020-04-23,38:57,Unnamed,"Thanks, Mr. President. If there is a summer ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time?"
2020-04-23,39:05,Donald Trump,Say it at the beginning. What?
2020-04-23,39:06,Unnamed,"So, if there is a summer sort of ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time to be better prepared for a possible resurgence in the fall than we were the first time?"
2020-04-23,39:17,Donald Trump,"Well, I’ll tell you one thing. I think a lot of people are going to go outside all of a sudden. People that didn’t want to go outside, they’ll be going. To me, this was really a very interesting meeting. We covered in great detail and these are incredible people at that. We could call it a laboratory because that’s essentially what it is. It’s a super laboratory. It’s a lot of things going on at that laboratory, a lot of very interesting things going on in that laboratory."
2020-04-23,39:41,Unnamed,"What would you and other areas of the government need to do on testing, for example, or other things like that to be prepared that came back in the fall? How would you take advantage of the summer?"
2020-04-23,39:50,Mike Pence,"It’s actually a very good question. It’s something the task force already has begun discussing that we are, if a combination of factors, let me say again. As states put into practice the guidelines to open up America again, implement safe and responsible plans to open up their economies along the lines that the President unveiled a week ago today, as people continue to properly exercise social distancing as is recommended in each phase, that in combination with some of these findings could well give us a summer respite from the coronavirus. And our team is already speaking about working on a continuous basis through this summer."
2020-04-23,40:37,Mike Pence,"Every single day we’re increasing testing. Every single day, Air Bridge flights are coming into the country. I can promise you with the President’s direction, there will be no letting up on making sure that our hospitals have the equipment, have the personal protective supplies for medical personnel. There’ll be no letting up on the development of therapeutics by our great pharmaceutical companies, are driving toward a vaccine as soon as it is possible to make available to the public, and there’ll be no letting up on continuing to scale testing already more than anyone in the world, but by next fall we’ll have a broad range of testing, a variety of different means, and that’s why we say with confidence that should the coronavirus re-emerge at any point next fall or next winter, we will be prepared to deal with it, identify it, do the contact tracing and isolation, to ensure that we deal with this epidemic in the manner that we deal with infectious diseases."
2020-04-23,41:45,Donald Trump,Okay? Go ahead.
2020-04-23,41:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, on the subject of medical research, why have you stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine as a cure?"
2020-04-23,41:56,Donald Trump,"I haven’t at all. I haven’t at all. We’ll see what happens. [crosstalk 00:41:58] We’ve had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps aren’t so good. I don’t know. I just read about one, but I also read many times good. So I haven’t at all. And it’s a great for malaria, for lupus, for other things, and we’ll see what it is. But I guess, Deborah, they have many, many studies going on on that. So we’ll be able to learn."
2020-04-23,42:19,Unnamed,What did the veterans study that shows that [crosstalk 00:42:21].
2020-04-23,42:21,Donald Trump,"I have not. I haven’t seen it. I have not seen it. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-23,42:24,Unnamed,"Mr. President. We’re now over 26 million new jobless claims over five weeks. The Vice President talked about this summer getting better, but what do your economists tell you about the time it’s going to take to you and the U.S. to create [crosstalk 00:06:43]-"
2020-04-23,42:41,Donald Trump,"Well, I know a lot about economists."
2020-04-23,42:43,Unnamed,August. September.
2020-04-23,42:45,Donald Trump,Sure.
2020-04-23,42:45,Unnamed,October.
2020-04-23,42:46,Donald Trump,"Well, let me know. We know the rest of the question. Right? So I know a lot about economists, and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good an idea as anybody and I think our economy will start to pick up very substantially as soon as the states get open, and that’s happening as we speak. And it’s actually very exciting and people are just thrilled to see it because our country has to get back to work. They want to get back to work. You see that whether it’s a demonstration or just in talking to people. They’re going to get back to work and they’re going to get back to work very fast. States are advanced. I look at Gavin Newsom was very nice today. He wrote a beautiful statement about we sent them a lot of things that he needed, okay, different things that he needed. We got it taken care of. They’ve done very well in California, as you know."
2020-04-23,43:35,Donald Trump,"They’re doing really well in Florida. They’re doing well in a lot of places. New York and New Jersey got hit very hard. They’re doing very well. I spoke again with Governor Cuomo, with Governor Murphy. They’re doing a great job, and here’s the thing, we have to see. They got hit hard, everyone close together, tied in. People don’t realize New Jersey is very tight. You realize that because you’ve been covering it for a long time, but very tight. New York obviously is very tight. They’re doing a terrific job. I think for the most part, I’ll be able to tell you when it’s all over, but a lot of the governors have done a really terrific job. Some I don’t think have, to be honest, but we’ll be talking about that in future. Yes. Go ahead."
2020-04-23,44:17,Unnamed,"Thank you, Mr. President. In a new interview today with TIME magazine, Dr. Fauci said that the U.S. is not in a situation where we can say we are where we want to be with regard to testing capacity. He said we need much more testing capacity as well as tests. So why do you keep saying we have a tremendous testing capacity, and do we have a national strategy that goes beyond tracking just what the states are doing?"
2020-04-23,44:46,Donald Trump,"The answer is yes. And the answer is, as you know, and as I’ve said many times, we’re very advanced in testing. Other countries are calling us to find out what are we doing, and by the way, within two weeks, you’ll see numbers and you’ll see different forms of testing, just like we came up with the Abbott Laboratories machine, which gives it to you in five minutes that everybody wants. Everybody’s asking, can we get that? But you can only make them so fast. But as you know, we’ve done more testing than every other nation combined and that’s a big statement, and you know when they talk about different tests and different things, we’re also a bigger nation than most. And so when they look at statistics, because statistically we’re doing phenomenally in terms of mortality, in terms of all of the different elements that you can judge."
2020-04-23,45:33,Donald Trump,"When you look, Germany and ourselves are doing very well. We are very accurate in the reporting of numbers. In fact, I’ll go a step further. As you know, in New York they actually added quite a few deaths to a list that was done in New York, and they added a number of deaths, were very, very highly accurate. And then you’ll look at certain lists of other countries. Some are so obvious just to look at where obviously the number’s ridiculous in the form of low because they’re not accurate counts. They’re not even close to accurate counts. In fact, they’re insulting to look at them. So we’ve done very well. Again, testing, we’re doing very well on testing. We’ve tested far more than anybody else, anywhere in the world, and within a short period of time you’ll be hearing about new tests that are coming out that are going to be incredible. Steve, go ahead."
2020-04-23,46:25,Unnamed,Do you agree with Dr. Fauci that we’re just not there yet?
2020-04-23,46:28,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t agree with them on that. No, I think we’re doing a great job in testing. I don’t agree. If he said that, I don’t agree with it. Yes."
2020-04-23,46:33,Steve (Reporter),Are you considering ways to ramp up production of that Abbott’s rapid testing?
2020-04-23,46:38,Donald Trump,"Well, they’re doing it. I’ll tell you, Steve. They’re doing it at a level that they’ve never done it before. Abbott is a great company. It’s a very big, highly respected company. They came up with this machine where you do it. I’ve done it both ways. I’ve done it this way and I didn’t like it, and I’ve done it the Abbott way where you literally just touch, and five minutes later you know the answer, and we use them in the White House. I think you folks have been given that opportunity, which is much more pleasant than the first way that they looked at you. Right?"
2020-04-23,47:08,Donald Trump,"We’re making them hundreds of thousands of machines. The advantage to the other tests and the laboratory tests that are we can get millions and millions of those tests done. It takes a day or two days, but you know, because it’s really a delivery situation more than anything else. The test itself goes quickly once it gets to the laboratory. But as we have found, and as we have, I think shown everybody in the room, we have many laboratories. We have so many laboratories. A lot of the governors did not know that we had this capacity, but we have many laboratories all over our country. Every state has laboratories and some have a lot of them. So I think we will come up with things as time goes by. Again, when I started, we ended up, we started with nothing, essentially. We started with a broken test, a test that didn’t work. We started with a test. They did very few people, not millions of people. The problem is if we did 350 million tests, one for each person, the media would say, “Oh, you should have done two for each person.”"
2020-04-23,48:15,Donald Trump,"No matter what you do, it doesn’t make any difference. It’s just like the ventilators. I talk about it all the time. Nobody ever mentions ventilators. One of the hardest things are ventilators, and now we’re making thousands a week, thousands of ventilators. And they’re calling from Mexico. They’re calling from many countries. I’ve received today four calls. “Would it be possible to send ventilators?” Right? I got four calls today. I got three calls yesterday. No country is equipped like we are. We have 11 different places making ventilators. Our country doesn’t need them now. Our governors are very happy. But that’s different than tests because with the tests you can always say, “Oh, we need more.” No, I think we’ve done incredibly well, obviously with ventilators, we also have 500 million masks, 500 million masks that are very shortly going to be here."
2020-04-23,49:09,Donald Trump,"We’ve made millions of masks. We have ordered millions of masks that have arrived and been distributed. We gave one hospital in New York City 300,000 masks. Before the virus, they were using 10,000 and now we got them 300,000, and they got rid of them very quickly, which I sort of say, how did that happen? Why? Because they became very valuable, the masks. So I say, how did that happen? But we’ve done an amazing job and we’ve worked with the governors, and when the governors weren’t able, again, they’re the first line. When they weren’t able to get something, like ventilators, they couldn’t get ventilators. They could have bought them. You could have bought them, but most of them, many of them chose not to. So they all needed ventilators and we got the job done."
2020-04-23,49:56,Donald Trump,"I’ll be introducing the team when we’re finished with this whole nightmare, this whole curse, this whole plague, but the team that worked on the ventilators was incredible. And it’s a little bit interchangeable, but the team that’s working on the testing is truly an incredible team. These are brilliant people and they’re doing it for the country. They’re not doing it for other reasons. Some have been very successful. They’re doing it for the country."
2020-04-23,50:22,Unnamed,"Mr. President, the House has now passed, since you were here, the relief bill."
2020-04-23,50:26,Donald Trump,Right. They’re signing it probably tonight.
2020-04-23,50:29,Unnamed,"As you know, there’s no aid to states and localities in that bill. Mitch McConnell, of course, has talked about states seeking bankruptcy protection. He’s also, his office, referred to this as the idea of aiding states is a blue state bail out. What do you say to that? Do you agree with that or do you agree with Governor Cuomo that that is a vicious attack on these states?"
2020-04-23,50:53,Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:50:53] I don’t think it’s a vicious attack, but certainly some people do look at it that way. I’ve spoken to Mitch about it. I’ve spoken to numerous senators about it, and we’re working with senators that are on the other side of the issue and we’ll see what happens. But we’re looking to do what’s right for the people of this country. We’re looking to do what’s right for a particular state and we’ll see what happens. But it’s certainly the next thing we’re going to be discussing because some states have, in all fairness, John, some states have not done very well for many years long before the virus came. You can’t blame the plague, this horrible plague that came in, and all of a sudden they can’t blame that. You look at Illinois. Now, he’s got a lot of problems long before the virus came in. And so we’ll be talking about it It’ll be a subject for a period of time."
2020-04-23,51:38,Donald Trump,"And right now we’ve made this incredible deal for the workers and for small business. And I’m very happy that Harvard didn’t get covered. We actually never sent them the check, but they were very nice about it. We never sent them the money, the old fashioned where’s the check? The new way is send them the money, and we didn’t send them the money, but they were very understanding and they were very nice about it, so was Princeton, so was Stanford, so were a number of other schools that you just don’t associate with this money. So were big companies as you know, you know many of them. It was a relatively small amount of money compared to the haul, very small amount of money compared. But we want it to be fair. We want it to go to the people that are supposed to go to."
2020-04-23,52:25,Unnamed,Are you open to this idea of state and local [crosstalk 00:52:28]-
2020-04-23,52:28,Donald Trump,"I’m open to ideas that are going to be great for the people of this country [crosstalk 00:52:32], and if we can help states, we’re always going to help states. Now there’s different ways of helping states. Some ways are better than others. So we’re looking. It is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue. It is interesting. You know, if you look around, I mean the states that seem to have the problem happened to be Democrat and-"
2020-04-23,52:49,Unnamed,New York and New Jersey got hit by this virus [crosstalk 00:52:54].
2020-04-23,52:53,Donald Trump,"But New York and New Jersey were in a lot of trouble long before the plague came. They had a lot of problems long before the plague came. I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it, spoke to Governor Murphy about it. I spoke with Gavin Newsom about it, and I’m speaking to a lot of people about it because it’s probably going to be the next thing on the list. A lot of people understand very well what Mitch is saying, and they also understand the other side of the problem and I’ll be speaking about it. We’re going to do the right thing for our country, the right thing for our country, and the right thing for a lot of great people. Okay? Yeah, please."
2020-04-23,53:26,Unnamed,"Mr. President, after the presentation we just saw about the heat and the humidity, is it dangerous for you to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people are dying in Florida, considering that this virus has had an outbreak in Singapore, places that are hot and humid?"
2020-04-23,53:43,Donald Trump,"Here we go. Here we go. The new headline is “Trump asks people to go outside. That’s dangerous.” Here we go. Same old group. You ready? I hope people enjoy the sun, and if it has an impact, that’s great. I’m just hearing this, not really for the first time. I mean, there’s been a rumor, a very nice rumor that you go outside in the sun-"
2020-04-23,54:03,Donald Trump,"…rumor that you know, a very nice rumor that you go outside in the sun or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses. But now we get it from one of the great laboratories of the world, I have to say. Covers a lot more territory than just this. This is probably an easy thing, relatively speaking, for you. I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there’s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure. You know? If you could? And maybe you can, maybe you can’t. Again, I say maybe you can, maybe you can’t. I’m not a doctor. But I’m a person that has a good… You know what. Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?"
2020-04-23,54:47,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Not as a treatment. I mean, certainly fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But, I’ve not seen heat or light as a-"
2020-04-23,54:57,Donald Trump,I think that’s a great thing to look at. Okay?
2020-04-23,55:00,Philip Rucker,"But, essentially, You’re the president and people tuning in to these briefings they want to get information and guidance and want to know what to do. They’re not looking for rumors."
2020-04-23,55:09,Donald Trump,"Hey, Phil. I’m the President and you’re fake news. And you know what I’ll say to you, I’ll say very nicely… I know you well. I know you well because I know the guy, I see what he writes. He’s a total faker. So are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? It’s just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant man. He’s talking about sun, he’s talking about heat and you see the numbers. So, that’s it. That’s all I have. I’m just here to present talent. I’m here to present ideas. Because we want ideas to get rid of this thing and if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned."
2020-04-23,55:46,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-23,55:47,Jon Sopel,"Mr. President, you talked a moment ago about vaccines and that we’re close. The Oxford University study says they could have one by September? Do you think the pharmaceutical companies, in the US-"
2020-04-23,55:58,Donald Trump,They could have one of what?
2020-04-23,56:00,Jon Sopel,Have a vaccine ready-
2020-04-23,56:02,Donald Trump,"Oxford’s one, Johnson & Johnson is working. They’re also working together. You have many companies working together on a vaccine."
2020-04-23,56:09,Jon Sopel,When do you think they can scale up production and that pharmaceutical companies will be able to do that quickly.
2020-04-23,56:16,Donald Trump,"Oh, we’ll scale it up. If we had a vaccine, it’ll be scaled up very quickly. In fact, some of the companies, Johnson and Johnson is one, is scaling up already before they have the final answer. A number of companies are doing that. You’ll save a lot of time. The normal is you scale up after, I have to say the FDA has been fantastic. Stephen Haun, Dr. Haun has been fantastic. They’re moving along rapidly, rapidly."
2020-04-23,56:39,Jon Sopel,Would you put a timescale? Or when do you think it’s-
2020-04-23,56:42,Donald Trump,"No, I don’t want to put a timescale scale because then the media, the so-called media, lame stream media will say, “He said a time.” I don’t want to say times because every time I say a time, if you don’t hit it they’ll say… So I don’t want to talk about time, but I will say that there’s been tremendous progress made over the last month."
2020-04-23,56:59,Jon Sopel,Could I just ask a very quick question?
2020-04-23,57:00,Donald Trump,Yeah.
2020-04-23,57:00,Jon Sopel,You spoke to Boris Johnson this week.
2020-04-23,57:02,Donald Trump,I did.
2020-04-23,57:02,Jon Sopel,"I just wonder how he sounded, how he was? When do you think he’ll be back at work?"
2020-04-23,57:07,Donald Trump,"He called me a few days ago. I will tell you, he sounded incredible. I was actually surprised. I thought it’d be like, “Oh Donald, how are you.” He was ready to go. I’m very surprised to tell you this. It’s like the old Boris. Tremendous energy. Tremendous drive. I was very surprised. Because, he called me pretty close to when he got out of the hospital. I think he’s doing great. I think he’s doing great. He was so sharp and energetic. Pretty incredible. He’s an incredible guy. He’s a friend of ours and a friend of mine. He loves our country. He loves his country a lot, but he loves our country. He respects our country and they’re lucky to have him over there."
2020-04-23,57:50,Donald Trump,Please.
2020-04-23,57:51,Jonathon Karl,"Mr. President, you, a couple of days ago, said that you might reach out to Kim Jong Un directly. But also, that you were working to find out if those reports about him being in possible medical trouble were true. I’m wondering if you’ve either-"
2020-04-23,58:04,Donald Trump,I hope he’s not in medical trouble. I hope he’s-
2020-04-23,58:06,Jonathon Karl,Have you heard anything from North Korea or-
2020-04-23,58:08,Donald Trump,"I’ve gotten along very well with him. And here we are. You would have been in a war with North Korea if I didn’t get elected President. Remember, I was going to be the one that took us into war my first day in office. Okay? Here we are, look at what’s happened. Withdrawal, we’re bringing people home. We’re not going to serve as policemen all over the world. I don’t want to be policemen all over the world."
2020-04-23,58:27,Jonathon Karl,Have you been able to-
2020-04-23,58:28,Donald Trump,"And yet we built our military to a level that has never been built at before,"
2020-04-23,58:33,Jonathon Karl,Have you [crosstalk 00:58:34]
2020-04-23,58:33,Donald Trump,But it’s never recognized by the fake news. Go ahead.
2020-04-23,58:36,Jonathon Karl,Have you been able to use that relationship to get more information about his status?
2020-04-23,58:41,Donald Trump,"I think the report was incorrect, let me just put it that way. I think the report was done by a network that was incorrect. I’m hearing they used old documents. But, that’s what I hear. I hear the report was an incorrect report. I hope it was an incorrect report."
2020-04-23,59:01,Jonathon Karl,When’s the last time you’ve heard from him?
2020-04-23,59:02,Donald Trump,I don’t want to say.
2020-04-23,59:03,Kaitlin Collins,"Since you pointed to me. Just a quick question about that. So you haven’t made any contact though, just to make sure."
2020-04-23,59:08,Donald Trump,With who?
2020-04-23,59:09,Kaitlin Collins,The North Koreans.
2020-04-23,59:10,Donald Trump,I don’t want to say. I won’t to say that.
2020-04-23,59:12,Kaitlin Collins,"Okay, so-"
2020-04-23,59:12,Donald Trump,"We have a good relationship with North Korea, as good as you can have. I mean we have a good relationship with North Korea. I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un and I hope he’s okay. And somebody would say, “Oh, that’s terrible.” No, it’s not terrible. I hope he’s okay. And I think it was a fake report done by CNN."
2020-04-23,59:28,Kaitlin Collins,"So, can I ask you a question?"
2020-04-23,59:29,Donald Trump,"What do you have? No, that’s enough. Go ahead."
2020-04-23,59:31,Kaitlin Collins,But that wasn’t my question.
2020-04-23,59:33,Donald Trump,"The problem is you don’t write the truth. So you know, as far as I’m concerned. I want to go to the next person."
2020-04-23,59:37,Kaitlin Collins,Can I ask you a question about Rick Bright?
2020-04-23,59:38,Donald Trump,"No. Not CNN, please. Go ahead."
2020-04-23,59:39,Kaitlin Collins,The White House has.
2020-04-23,59:41,Donald Trump,"I told you, CNN is fake news. Don’t talk to me. Go ahead. Please."
2020-04-23,59:46,Kaitlin Collins,But he says he was retaliated against and that’s why he was removed from this job. Do you have a response to that?
2020-04-23,59:51,Donald Trump,"Okay, next question."
2020-04-23,59:52,Unnamed,"Mr. President, I have two questions. One on behalf of a colleague who is not here because of social distancing."
2020-04-23,59:57,Donald Trump,Just ask one please.
2020-04-23,59:59,Unnamed,First one. Could you talk about your decision making process with the Governor of Georgia.
2020-04-23,01:00:04,Donald Trump,On what?
2020-04-23,01:00:04,Unnamed,"You, yesterday, said-"
2020-04-23,01:00:05,Donald Trump,The controversy?
2020-04-23,01:00:07,Unnamed,No. You said yesterday that you told the Governor of Georgia you were concerned-
2020-04-23,01:00:10,Donald Trump,I did. I had a good talk with the Governor of Georgia.
2020-04-23,01:00:12,Unnamed,Earlier in the week you spoke and you did not convey this kind of message. Was there a change in your thinking?
2020-04-23,01:00:17,Donald Trump,"I did convey the message, I didn’t like the fact that he’s leaving certain things… I want the States to open more than he does, much more than he does. But I didn’t like to see spas at this early stage, nor did the doctors. Is that a correct statement, Deborah? I didn’t like to see spas opening, frankly. I didn’t like to see a lot of things happening and I wasn’t happy with it. And I wasn’t happy with Brian Kemp. I wasn’t at all happy. I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I’m saying let the governors do it. But I wasn’t happy with Brian Kemp. Spas, beauty parlors, tattoo parlors. No, that’s-"
2020-04-23,01:00:57,Unnamed,[crosstalk 01:00:57] experts?
2020-04-23,01:00:57,Donald Trump,"Excuse me. I want them to open and I want them to open as soon as possible. I want the state to open, but I wasn’t happy with Brian Kemp. I will tell you that right now."
2020-04-23,01:01:07,Donald Trump,"Yeah, go ahead."
2020-04-23,01:01:08,Jonathon Karl,Were you surprised he defied you on that? Because you made it clear-
2020-04-23,01:01:11,Donald Trump,"No, he didn’t defy me at all. That’s your language. He didn’t defy me. You know what happened? I said, “You make your own decision.” I told him that. I said, “You’re not in the guidelines but I’m letting you make your own decision. But I want people to be safe and I want the people in Georgia to be safe and I don’t want this thing to flare up because you’re deciding to do something that is not in the guidelines.” And I went to Deborah and Dr. Fauci and other people, and they weren’t thrilled about it. I could have stopped him but I decided, and we all agreed, they got to watch it closely. So we’ll see what happens. I told him very distinctly, Mike was there, I said, “You do what you think is best.” But if you ask me am I happy about it, I’m not happy about it. And I’m not happy about Brian Kemp."
2020-04-23,01:01:57,Donald Trump,Go ahead.
2020-04-23,01:01:58,Unnamed,"A question for Dr. Birx, If I may Mr. President, about the rate of the decline of the curve in the US. You and the Vice President tonight talking about meaningful progress, promising progress. Could you speak to the rate of decline of cases in the US?"
2020-04-23,01:02:16,Donald Trump,"If you can do it quickly, that’d be great. You see on the charts, [crosstalk 01:02:16] But you have to ask the question, but you do see it on the charts."
2020-04-23,01:02:16,Unnamed,If you’re satisfied with the decline. And if you have any information from other countries that would inform us about the decline?
2020-04-23,01:02:26,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Many of you, and I’ve spoken to all of you from this podium about, there’s Weekends difference in reporting, often a spike on Monday. If you look at Mondays over Mondays, if you look at seven day reporting, we are starting to go down. We had a long flat peak, largely driven of course by New York. Which is about 45 or so percent of the cases. As New York goes down, so will the rest of the country have a decline even more accelerated. I want to say though, we have had outbreaks. We’ve had outbreaks in specific prisons, we’ve had outbreaks in specific nursing homes. We’ve had outbreaks in specific plants and when that happens, that adds 2, 300, 400 cases on that single day. So we track very carefully not only what the country’s doing, but what each state is doing, each County is doing. And we look at delta changes across all of the counties so that we find early warning signals for these types of outbreaks. Because we want the whole country to go down, but we also want to prevent the outbreaks before they occur."
2020-04-23,01:03:34,Franco Ordonez,Mr. President?
2020-04-23,01:03:35,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-04-23,01:03:36,Franco Ordonez,"Yes, thank you. Looking forward to November to the election, given the risks that the flu and the coronavirus-"
2020-04-23,01:03:44,Donald Trump,"Yeah, that’s a problem."
2020-04-23,01:03:46,Franco Ordonez,"There could be a problem. Do you think that is a risk that there will be lack of agreement, like legitimacy to the results in a very close election and people start saying, “Well, a whole bunch of people couldn’t go and vote because they were sick?”"
2020-04-23,01:03:59,Donald Trump,"Look, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen in and election. Yeah, great question. I can’t tell you what’s going to happen. We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to, who doesn’t want to do debates because of Covid. And lots of things are happening, right? And I watched a couple of interviews and I say, “Oh, I look forward to this.” But, they’re keeping them sheltered because of the coronavirus and he’s not moving around. He’s not moving too much. Then I watch what the press does to the Republican party and to me in particular."
2020-04-23,01:04:37,Donald Trump,"We had the greatest economy ever put together, this as a month and a half ago. We were doing numbers the likes of which we’ve never done. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American best employment numbers ever in the history of our country. Our employment numbers, the best in the history of our country, almost 160 million people. The stock market record numbers many, many times during my tenure. Many, many times."
2020-04-23,01:05:03,Donald Trump,"But now we have a country that we had to close because of this. And frankly if we didn’t close it, we would have lost millions of people possibly. But certainly we would have lost a million people. You take the high number and cut it in half, cut it in half again. But, whether it would have been 600, 700, 800 you take a look at the travesty that there is. You take a look at this horrible, horrible scene of hospitals with bodies and black body bags. Right? Multiply that times 10, 15, or even 20, because that would have happened. So we did the right thing. So far, we did the right thing. So far, we’ve called it right."
2020-04-23,01:05:43,Donald Trump,"We’ve mobilized like it was a military operation and it was largely a military operation. Between ventilators and testing and so many other things that we’ve had a lot of good partners, not all good partners, but we had a lot of good partners. Gavin Newsom, today, thanked us very much. Gavin Newsom, California, thanked us so much for getting him all the things that he needed so he can keep going and keep doing a good job. We got it to him today. Tomorrow we’re getting him even more. Would have been harder for him to get it than us. We agreed to get it, we got it on time. He said, “Promises made, promises kept.” He actually said that in a statement today."
2020-04-23,01:06:18,Donald Trump,"We’ve done a good job. We’ve gotten very little credit for the great job we’ve done because of the media. Because the media is not an honest media, in my opinion. Much of it, not all of it, we have some great reporters that I have tremendous respect… But much of the media is not honest."
2020-04-23,01:06:31,Donald Trump,"So, I can’t tell you about the election. You have a Democrat Party and you have a large portion of the media automatically giving the guy a pass. He’s been given a pass. Whether or not he’s going to be the nominee, I have no idea, but he’s getting a pass. And the media isn’t covering the great job that we’ve done. Whether it’s Mike’s task force, which has been incredible. Whether it’s the way we mobilized, in a warlike operation, to build these incredibly complex and very expensive ventilators. They’re very expensive to build and very complex. The job we’ve done has been an amazing job, and I’m not talking about me, I’m talking about everybody. I’m talking about the generals, the admirals, Deborah and Tony. And now, Bill, something we hadn’t heard today."
2020-04-23,01:07:23,Donald Trump,"I can’t tell you what’s going to happen with the election. I think that had we not gone through a fake, “Russia, Russia, Russia deal,” an impeachment hoax, it was a total hoax. From the day I got elected. But you know it wasn’t a day, it was many months before I got elected. This has been a witch hunt that was illegal. It was an illegal witch hunt. It was illegal. And with all of that, I’m doing fine because the people see we’re doing a great job. And you know what? We’ll continue to do a great job. If we had an honest press, this country would be even greater. Thank you. Thank you, very much."
2020-04-24,01:52,Donald Trump,Thank you very much everyone. Thank you.
2020-04-24,01:59,Donald Trump,"We continue to see evidence that our aggressive strategy is working and working at a very high level. Nationwide, the percent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly. Last week, roughly 38% of the tests in New York were positive. This week that number is down to 28%. New cases in New York are down 50% compared to a week ago and fatalities are down 40% over the same period."
2020-04-24,02:29,Donald Trump,"In Louisiana, the rate of positive tests results decline from 25% down to 15% in the last seven days alone. 18 States now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days. So over the last seven days has been very, very significant progress."
2020-04-24,02:49,Donald Trump,"Half of all Americans live in States that have now taken steps to open their economies. Just yesterday, governors, Gavin Newsom, California, Tim Waltz of Minnesota and Billy of Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors. We ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing and voluntary use of face coverings."
2020-04-24,03:15,Donald Trump,We’re opening our country. It’s very exciting to see. We have a lot of talent involved from governors down to people that just stand there and help you with the doors. There’s been tremendous talent involved and tremendous spirit from our country. Our country is a great place and it’s going to be greater than ever before. I really believe that. I think there’s going to be a tremendous upward shift. I spoke with Tim cook today of Apple and they have a good sense of the market and he feels it’s going to be a V. The V is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open.
2020-04-24,03:55,Donald Trump,"Today I signed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act providing $320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll. $30 billion of the Paycheck Protection Funds will be reserved for small financial institutions including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American, small business owners and their employees. The Bill also delivers $75 billion for hospitals, so badly needed for hospitals. They’ve taken a very big hit and medical providers in areas less effected by the virus, hospitals and doctors should work with their state and local health officials on ways to safely resume elective medical treatments and care."
2020-04-24,04:46,Donald Trump,"Under the CARES Act, we’re sending direct payments to millions of American workers. More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment. $3,400 for a typical family of four, $3,400 that’s great, and you deserve it. The CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving. To fulfill the requirement, the treasury department is mailing a letter to me. It will include the amount, their economic impact payment, how it will arrive, direct deposit, check or prepaid debit card as well as a message to the nation, letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family and that’s what’s been happening. The whole world is watching this. You have 184 countries out there that have been hit and now it’s probably higher than that, but they’re all watching us. They’re all watching and they’re calling and they respect what we’re doing so much."
2020-04-24,05:49,Donald Trump,"I spoke with the leaders of numerous countries today. They’re asking if we can send them ventilators and I’m agreeing to do it. We have tremendous capacity, now, over capacity of ventilators. We’re filling up stockpiles for our States and for ourselves. Federal government has over 10,000 ventilators and we could have a lot more if we wanted to do that, but we’re helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France. We’re sending to France, we’re sending to Spain, we’re sending to Italy and we’ll probably be sending to Germany should they need them."
2020-04-24,06:23,Donald Trump,"Over the last three years, we built the strongest economy and the most successful country the world has ever seen, greatest economy the world has ever seen. Nobody’s ever done anything like what we were able to do and we will rebuild that economy, our economy in the not too distant future. I really believe with all that we’ve learned and all that we’ve done, will be just as strong and maybe stronger than ever before, even stronger than it was just two months ago."
2020-04-24,06:54,Donald Trump,"Some interesting notice that the FDA approved, the first at home COVID-19 test kit just got approved and doctor Steven… Where is Steven? Steven Hahn is going to say a couple of words about that and some other things. I want to thank Steven. The FDA has been incredible. They’ve been approving not only this, but they’ve been approving many things at a pace that’s never happened before. And they’re being very safe about it, as Steven told me, he’s told me very strongly, but at the same time they’re approving things at record numbers at a record rate, and it’s really been helpful. Many tests are going on, many vaccine tests and tests of every different kind and things are happening just like this event, things are happening very rapidly and I’d like to have Steven tell you a little bit about it. Thank you very much."
2020-04-24,07:48,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Thank you Mr. President. Appreciate the opportunity to tell you about what’s happening at the FDA. We have a team of more than 18,000 employees including 10,000 scientists, doctors, pharmacists and nurses. And they’ve been working around the clock because as you probably know, many of the medical products that are being used for the COVID-19 outbreak are in fact regulated by FDA. The staff have been hard at work authorizing tests and other medical products."
2020-04-24,08:16,Dr. Steven Hahn,"As part of these efforts to support diagnostic test development during this global pandemic, the president has asked us and under the leadership to actually cut down as many barriers as we possibly could to get medical products into the medical community and we have done that, of course recognizing the urgency of the situation. I do want to emphasize what the president said that is that we are very much paying attention to safety and with respect to test validity and reliability of those tests."
2020-04-24,08:44,Dr. Steven Hahn,"And I think it’s really important to understand how far we’ve come in just a few short months. The academic community, which I come from, the private sector, the government, we’ve come together to develop diagnostics for completely new infectious disease. And it’s really important, we’ve heard from many test developers, both in academia and in the manufacturing world, this normally takes years to develop. You’ve heard Dr. Burks talk about the fact that HIV tests have taken many, many years to develop. This has happened in weeks and months. We’ve been laser focused on working with both industry and academia to actually make this happen."
2020-04-24,09:21,Dr. Steven Hahn,"To date, under our emergency use authorization approach, we’ve quickly reviewed and authorized 63 tests, both diagnostic as well as serologic. That is the antibody test. We’ve had several point of care tests and that’s important because those can be done in the emergency room or in a doctor’s office, et cetera, and much more convenient for the patient. And this week as the president said we authorize the first pet home test by a company called Lab Corp. This is a test where under certain circumstances with a doctor’s supervision, a test can be mailed to a patient and the patient can perform the self swab and then mail it back and get the results after that time, all under the guidance of a licensed physician."
2020-04-24,10:01,Dr. Steven Hahn,"And we’re not just letting up with these 63 tests we’ve approved, we are a working with more than 400 test developers who are pursuing authorization for their diagnostic under our current policies. And under our regulatory approach, which is quite flexible, many other tests are becoming available. We have heard and have reported to us 220 labs around the country have begun patient testing using their own validated tests. This has allowed us to increase significantly tests around the country."
2020-04-24,10:32,Dr. Steven Hahn,"I updated you earlier this week on serologic tests, these antibody tests that are used to detect natural immunity and the FDA’s approach to help make these tests available. While these are just one part of our larger response effort, they can play a role in helping move our economy forward by helping healthcare professionals identify those who have immunity to the COVID-19."
2020-04-24,10:53,Dr. Steven Hahn,"And just finally, when it comes to therapeutics, we are leaving no stone unturned in finding treatments for COVID-19. You do know that we don’t have any approved currently therapeutics for COVID-19, but we are actively involved with both the academic and the commercial and private sector to find those 72 trials of therapeutics are underway in the United States under FDA oversight and 211 are in the planning stages. So we expect to see more, this includes convalescent plasma as well as antiviral therapies."
2020-04-24,11:24,Dr. Steven Hahn,"Work continues on vaccines and two firms have announced that the FDA has authorized their trials to go forward, one of which we’ve mentioned here before. And finally in response to the presence and task force requests, we’ve stood up the coronavirus treatment acceleration program. We are leaving no stone unturned as I said, and we’re working around the clock to develop these therapeutics for the American people. Thank you very much."
2020-04-24,11:51,Unnamed,[Crosstalk 00:11:51] It’s a quick question and it’s timely because just about an hour ago as subcommittee with oversight released some findings that the FDA doesn’t have any review of the antibody tests that are on the market. There are no guidelines to tell which one should be out there and there’s no way to test their accuracy. They’re quite worried that these are junk tests on the market because they weren’t reviewed before they were approved. Is that true?
2020-04-24,12:19,Dr. Steven Hahn,"So under our policy, we provide a flexibility. What we’ve told manufacturers is that in order to market in the US, they have to validate their tests, they have to tell us that they validated their tests and then in the package insert they have to let people know and users labs, et cetera, that those tests were not authorized by FDA. We’ve authorized four. As I mentioned, more in the pipeline. And these tests that have come in without any information to us but have been self validated, as I mentioned at the podium a couple of days ago, we are working with the national cancer Institute as well as CDC to perform our own validation of the tests that have been sent to us. So we’ll provide as much information as we possibly can. And there is transparency on our website about those tests and also the tests that we have authorized. Thank you."
2020-04-24,13:15,Mike Pence,"Thank you Mr. President. From early in this effort, president Trump has called forth a whole of government response to the Coronavirus epidemic in America. And by that, the president made clear when he asked me to lead the white house coronavirus task force, not merely a whole of the federal government, but a full partnership with state and local governments across the country. And today we renewed that with our latest conference call with governors all across America. We’ve met with them today specifically to speak about the progress that our governors are making, expanding testing across the country. And we were pleased to hear about the extraordinary and rapid progress that governors are making."
2020-04-24,13:59,Mike Pence,"At the outset of the call where we had more than 50 of our nation’s governors, we of course had Pete Gainer of FEMA report on progress. More than 35,000 national guard stood up, 5,000 active duty military deployed in 10 States and we were also pleased to report that FEMA, HHS, and the private sector have coordinated the delivery of shipments to States around the country, including nearly 67 million N95 masks, 105 million surgical masks, surgical gowns, shields, gloves, more than 10,000 ventilators and more than 8,000 federal field medical station beds."
2020-04-24,14:42,Mike Pence,"Beyond the report that we provided to the governors, we assured them that at the president’s direction, this is a one team, one mission. We’ve made it clear to the governors that we know we’re all in this together and the partnership that we have forged together really begins with mitigation efforts. It moves to making sure our healthcare workers have the support they need, but also testing is in the forefront of all of our minds. We’re working to make it possible for every governor to access the existing capacity to enable our States to be able to reopen responsibly under the phased approach that the president unveiled one week ago."
2020-04-24,15:23,Mike Pence,"A little bit of context, you may recall that one month ago all of the testing that had been done in America, 80,000 Americans had been tested, but as of this morning, 5.1 million Americans have been tested for the Coronavirus."
2020-04-24,15:39,Mike Pence,"A quick reminder to our fellow Americans, and this was something from our scientists today at the task force, we reminded governors of this as well, that as testing increases dramatically across the country, cases will increase as well, but people should not be discouraged by those numbers. We are looking at very positive trends in hospitalization, in emergency room entrances and we continue to see, as we’ve said at this podium every day over the last several weeks, we continue to see positive progress, not just on the West coast, but even where the Coronavirus epidemic has most deeply impacted in areas of greater New York city area, New Orleans, Detroit, and elsewhere. On our nearly two hour phone call today with those governors, we heard of the progress governors were making in implementing the resources that we’ve been working to provide them, not just the medical equipment but also as you recall that map a week ago that showed where all of the equipment is all across the country in all 50 States."
2020-04-24,16:49,Mike Pence,"Governor Cuomo joined us for the call today. He spoke favorably of his meeting here at the white house, Mr. President, and his recognition that testing is a partnership between the federal and state governments. As governor Cuomo said today, he understood that the federal government works with national manufacturing and supply chain and the governors deal with the labs to expand and implement testing at the state level. Governor Cuomo also explained how he’s using his licensing authority as a governor to stand up the more than 300 labs that can do Coronavirus testing in the state of New York and we congratulated him for his leadership in that, urged other governors to use their authority similarly."
2020-04-24,17:34,Mike Pence,"In Tennessee, governor Bill Lee told us that he’s deployed the national guard to stand up more than 20 drive through test sites. They’re testing 10,000 people a day. They’ve already tested more than 130,000 people in Tennessee and they expect to surge another 15,000 people in testing sites this weekend in Tennessee."
2020-04-24,17:53,Mike Pence,"Massachusetts in an area we’re continuing to watch very closely as cases have not yet stabilized, and governor Charlie Baker, he thanked us, Mr president, for the army Corps of engineers deployment of four field hospitals. He described how they have rapidly expanded testing all across Massachusetts. We commended him for that and the beginning of March he said they had just one testing site in the state of Massachusetts, and now thanks to governor Charlie Baker’s team, they have more than 30 testing sites."
2020-04-24,18:24,Mike Pence,"Minnesota governor, Tim waltz, reflected on the call today about the partnership he’s forged with the Mayo clinic, the university of Minnesota and state health department. They’re actually collaborating to perform 20,000 molecular tests and 15,000 antibody tests per day, and I’m looking forward to traveling to the Mayo clinic in Minnesota on Tuesday of next week to learn firsthand from the governor about their efforts across the state to expand testing."
2020-04-24,18:52,Mike Pence,"Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, gave us an update, Mr. President on her progress. She’s literally tripling testing capacity in her state through a partnership with the private sector, with the university of Iowa and Iowa state university. She also launched the testiowa.com website, which actually creates an access point for people to fill out a questionnaire about whether or not their symptoms or circumstances would justify a test. She said in the first 72 hours, 150,000 people went to the test site to receive an assessment and Iowa testing 4,500 people a day in their state."
2020-04-24,19:32,Mike Pence,"In Indiana, I spoke also today with governor Eric Holcomb. They’ve tested 72,000 Hoosiers to date. They’re adding drive through sites. They’ll have 10 drive through sites established by the state of Indiana before the end of the weekend and as other governors have done governor Holcomb last week opened up half of their elective surgery sites and hospitals across the state and they’ll be opening up the balance of their elective surgery sites the next week."
2020-04-24,20:01,Mike Pence,"In Maryland, another area that we’re watching very closely, governor Larry Hogan expressed appreciation for federal support as he’s continuing to scale testing. He had been in touch with the National Institute of Health, which is opening up its laboratories for Maryland to do testing and we were also able to confirm to him that Walter Reed hospital’s laboratory capacity is available to Maryland."
2020-04-24,20:23,Mike Pence,"And in Utah, Mr. President, governor Gary Herbert told us that he actually diverted 1200 state employees to do contact tracing in their state. In the last 36 hours, 23,000 residents have also signed up for what they’re calling their Healthy Together app and they have 50 different testing locations across Utah and have tested 82,000 people in the state already."
2020-04-24,20:48,Mike Pence,"Other state examples, Mr. President, were just as inspiring. Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey has forged a partnership with Rutgers university, working closely with the FDA. They’ve authorized a saliva based test that is being deployed just at that site that’s expanding their ability to track what continues to be a very challenging environment in New Jersey."
2020-04-24,21:13,Mike Pence,"And governor Mike Parsons of Missouri, Mr. President also told us how they’d worked with Google marketplace to create an online portal for more than 200 companies in Missouri who have repurposed their manufacturing lines to create medical supplies to meet their need within the state."
2020-04-24,21:33,Mike Pence,"And in Connecticut, governor Ned Lamont, spoke about a positive trend lines in Connecticut which has been really at the center of the outbreak in the greater New York area. But he also said they were hoping to double testing over the next week."
2020-04-24,21:48,Mike Pence,"Mr. President, that’s just a sampling of what we had today and I know it’s an encouragement to you and I trust it’s an encouragement to people all across the country that at your direction we are implementing a testing strategy that is supported at the federal level, but it is deployed and managed at the state level. And we want to express our appreciation to every governor across the country that are standing up all of those labs that are available that are working with us and our supply chain personnel to make sure that the reagents and the swabs and the equipment is there to be able to process the tests, and we’re going to continue to increase testing dramatically in the weeks ahead."
2020-04-24,22:30,Mike Pence,"So we want to thank our governors for the progress that we’re making on testing and for their role and in urging their citizens to practice the kind of mitigation and social distancing efforts that are really making real progress. We’re one team, one mission that’s to save lives and because of of all the efforts that have been made at the state level and a strong guidance that’s come from the federal level because of the amazing healthcare workers across this country and our first responders, but mostly I believe because of the cooperation of millions of Americans who’ve put the guidance into practice. Their cooperation and their prayers have set us on a path where we are slowing the spread, we are protecting our most vulnerable. I truly do believe the day will soon come when we will heal our land and we’ll be able to re-open America and put this great nation back to work. Thank you Mr. President."
2020-04-27,07:07,Unnamed,"Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States accompanied by the vice president of the United States."
2020-04-27,07:25,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Today I’d like to provide you with an update in our war against the coronavirus. Thanks to our comprehensive strategy and extraordinary devotion to our citizens. We’ve had such tremendous support all over. We continue to see encouraging signs of progress. Cases in New York area, New Orleans, Detroit, Boston, and Houston are declining. Denver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Atlanta, Nashville, Indianapolis, and St Louis are all stable and declining."
2020-04-27,08:09,Donald Trump,"All parts of the country are either in good shape, getting better, in all cases, getting better, and we’re seeing very little that we’re going to look at as a superseding hotspot. Things are moving along really a horrible situation that we’ve been confronted with, but they’re moving along. As we express our gratitude for these hard-fought gains however, we continue to mourn with thousands of families across the country whose loved ones have been stolen from us by the invisible enemy."
2020-04-27,08:46,Donald Trump,"We grieve by their side as one family, this great American family, and we do grieve. We also stand in solidarity with the thousands of Americans who are ill and waging a brave fight against the virus. We’re doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually reopen our nation and to safely get our people back to work. They want to get back to work and they want to get back to work soon."
2020-04-27,09:15,Donald Trump,There’s a hunger for getting our country back and it’s happening and it’s happening faster than people would think. Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation. These goals work in tandem. They work side by side. It’s clear that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread has been working and is saving countless lives. For those who are infected. We’ve taken unprecedented action to ensure they have the highest level of care anywhere in the world.
2020-04-27,09:47,Donald Trump,"The federal government has built more than 11,000 extra beds, shipped or delivered hundreds of millions of pieces of personal protective equipment. As you know, in fact, some of the people here are going to be talking about it. Some of our greatest executives, some of the greatest anywhere in the world, and distributed over 10,000 ventilators and we now have in a very short period of time, many have been delivered and hundreds of thousands are being built and frankly, every governor has more ventilators right now than they know what to do with."
2020-04-27,10:21,Donald Trump,"They’re actually shipping them to different locations and we’re shipping some to our allies and others throughout the world because we have ventilators like the job that they’ve done and getting this very complex piece of equipment built is actually incredible. You don’t hear about ventilators anymore except in a positive way. We’ve launched the most ambitious testing effort, likewise on earth."
2020-04-27,10:48,Donald Trump,"The United States has now conducted more than 5.4 million tests, nearly double the number tested in any other country more than twice as much as any other country. Think of that. Moments ago, I came from a meeting with some of our nation’s largest retailers, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Kroger. We’re a joined by the leaders of those great companies and we also have with us the leaders from the world’s top medical diagnostics companies and suppliers, Thermo Fisher, LabCorp Quest, [US Carlton 00:00:11:26] and the American Clinical Laboratory Association."
2020-04-27,11:29,Donald Trump,"These are great companies. These private sector leaders along with others such as Roche, Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Hologic and Cepheid have been exceptional partners in an unprecedented drive to expand the state’s capabilities and our country’s capabilities. The job they’ve done has been incredible. The testing that’s been developed and being developed right now has been truly an amazing thing."
2020-04-27,12:03,Donald Trump,"I want to thank Abbott Laboratories for the job they’ve done. I want to thank Roche and in particular those two have really stepped forward Abbott with a five minute test that people can take and in five minutes they know what the answer is. I’d like to ask if I could, the executives of these great companies and they have really helped us a lot over the last 45-day period."
2020-04-27,12:28,Donald Trump,We’re talking about a 45-day period when many of us met and since then what Walmart and the others have done has been nothing short of amazing. I just want to ask them to come forward and say a few words about their company plus they’re going to make a big contribution to our country. Please come forward please. Thank you. Come on up. Thanks. Thanks very much.
2020-04-27,12:56,Steve Rusckowski,"Thank you Mr. President and thank you all of you for being here today and what we’d like to talk about is the progress we’ve made. The last time we were here was March 13th and we’ve made tremendous progress and none of that progress could be made without the 47,000 people at Quest Diagnostics that are working around the clock and working up the test and running the test and delivering the results that we need."
2020-04-27,13:22,Steve Rusckowski,"As far as results, we’ve made tremendous progress. We are currently at Quest Diagnostics testing and about 50, 000 tests per day. We’ve been pushed by the task force to bring up that number. By the end of May, we’ll have 100,000 tests per day about 3 million tests, and these are the molecular tests that we do today. We’ve also brought up serological testing. We started that this past week and by the end of May we’ll be close to 250,000 a day, about 7,000 a month."
2020-04-27,13:53,Steve Rusckowski,"You put those two numbers together it’s about 10 million tests by the end of the May that we’ll be doing at Quest Diagnostics. We’re doing that also in a quicker way. Turnaround times were somewhat of an issue at the early days. We’ve reduced that to one to two days. Our turnaround time for people in beds, hospital beds is less than 24 hours, and we’re doing that in the same way we’ve done it with the FDA and with CLIA delivering the quality that you all expect and convenience will improve as well with convenient solutions that will be able to swab individuals more easily and also deliver to consumer the ability to have consumers choose a test online with the telehealth provider."
2020-04-27,14:34,Steve Rusckowski,"With that, I’d like to offer my colleague the podium as well."
2020-04-27,14:39,Adam Schechter,"Thank you. Mr. President. Thank you very much for your leadership and for having us all here today. Our scientists and our lab technicians are working day and night in order to do as many tests as we possibly can for the American public and to turn those tests around as quickly as possible. Just 45 days ago we said we could do several thousand tests a day. We can now do 60,000 tests a day and we’re continuing to expand that capacity every single day."
2020-04-27,15:11,Adam Schechter,"In addition, our scientists are working to make testing more convenient and easier. We have the swabs now that are much smaller than the original ones that we originally launched with, but we also have the Pixel by LabCorp at-home test. That test right now is for healthcare workers on the frontline and first responders, but we will be rolling that out much more broadly over the coming weeks and we’re going to roll it out with absolutely no upfront cost for the individual consumers."
2020-04-27,15:39,Adam Schechter,"At the same time, we are building our capacity for serology testing and we can currently do about 50,000 today and we’ll be able to do several hundred thousand per day by the middle of May. We’re going to where you’re working with the retailers. Our colleagues are here today to help them as they expand their testing capabilities across the entire country. Lastly, Mr. President, we have a rather large drug development…"
2020-04-27,16:03,Adam Schechter,"And lastly, Mr president, we have a rather large drug development business and we will continue to work with our colleagues and the pharmaceutical and the biotechnology industry to ensure we do everything we possibly can to enroll clinical trials fast so that we can get new treatments and potential vaccines. Thank you."
2020-04-27,16:20,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Thank you gentlemen. Please go ahead.
2020-04-27,16:28,Marc Casper,"Mr president. Thank you and thank the administration for all of the collaboration to enable Thermo Fisher Scientific to be able to produce the test kits that companies like LabCorp and Quest and the public health labs around the world run. We met our original commitments of producing 5,000,000 kits a week and we’re up to scaling that to double that in the coming weeks in terms of supporting testing around the world. I’d like to thank my 75,000 colleagues around the world for their tireless effort to make that a reality and supporting all of our customers to have the testing necessary to get America back to work."
2020-04-27,17:05,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.
2020-04-27,17:14,John Nims,"Thank you Mr president. I’m John Nims with US Cotton and we are the company that is going to produce the swabs to be used in these testing kits. We have about 1200 people in our company and in our Cleveland operation they have pivoted from… As you’ve said, the Q-tip style swab to a swab that’s going to have a plastic stick with a polyester tip so that they can be assembled into these kits. Our Cleveland team has done a wonderful job with this and they’re very excited to be able to help in this effort. So thank you mr president."
2020-04-27,17:46,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Great job.
2020-04-27,17:54,Larry Merlo,"Mr president, thank you. I’m Larry Merlo with CVS health and it was just over a month ago that we opened up our first drive through test site and since that time we have opened wide-scale testing facilities across five States in partnership with the administration and working with the governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia in Michigan. And these sites are enabling us to test approximately 1,000 individuals a day with realtime results. We now have a capacity to test about 35,000 individuals each week. And this afternoon we announced plans to expand that capacity even further beginning in May, we will install testing capabilities in up to a thousand CVS pharmacies. We’ll be using our drive-throughs and our parking lots with swab testing. So again, you’ll see that coming online in may. And we also recognize the fact that the virus is disproportionately affecting our minority communities."
2020-04-27,18:57,Larry Merlo,"So we’re working in partnership organizations like the National Medical Association to bring testing and care into the traditionally underserved communities. We’re also beginning to implement mobile capabilities with which to do that. And as businesses are restarting their workforce, we’ll also be looking to assist them as they begin to come back to a normal operation. And finally, as my other colleagues, I just want to thank my CVS colleagues, they have done a phenomenal job in terms of helping people in many different ways all across communities in the country. And they’re part of this army of healthcare professionals and front store and first line supervisors and workers that are doing terrific things to bring our country together. And for that we owe them a huge amount of gratitude. Thank you."
2020-04-27,19:51,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.
2020-04-27,19:59,Richard Ashworth,"Thank you mr president. Appreciate the invitation to be here today and it was just 45 days ago when we were here. I’m Richard Ashworth, I oversee Walgreens in the US and I just want to start off Larry, like you thinking the over 200,000 Walgreen team members who are in stores every day all across America, taking care of our patients and our customers giving them essential daily needs, the prescriptions obviously that they need and even COVID testing while we’re here. We also announced today we’ll be expanding our testing capabilities across all States including Puerto Rico. We’ll be able to triple the volume that we do now in partnership with our lab partners and we’re excited to be able to do that. We’re really excited with the public private partnership that we have here because that’s what enabling us to do this and we look forward to working with the additional States to get these sites up and running as fast as possible."
2020-04-27,20:53,Richard Ashworth,"As a pharmacist, I just want to say one quick thing. I’m really proud to be part of this profession and not just Walgreens pharmacists and pharmacy employees, but all of them across grocery, mass independence. You’re really doing what you should be doing and what you went to school for it to help patients, counseling them on their medicines and helping them understand the problems that we’re facing. Pharmacy is right here in it with everyone together in the community and we look forward to being part of the testing like we are now serology, whatever that might look like in the future and eventually treatment when the vaccine does come. So thank you Mr president for the opportunity. Thank you."
2020-04-27,21:37,Donald Trump,Great job. Thank you very much.
2020-04-27,21:37,Rodney McMillan,"Thank you Mr president. Thank you Mr vice president. We appreciate all you’re doing to get America back to work and doing it safely. I represent Kroger and my name is Rodney McMillan and I am so proud of our nearly half a million associates that are doing everything every day to keep customers safe and our associates safe. And one of the things that we were able to do is provide basic practices we’re doing, we call it blueprint and it’s the things that all of us can learn from on how to get America back working. We also announced earlier today continuing to accelerate our practice on testing. We are actively engaged in six States. In the next couple of weeks we’ll take that to 12 States and the number of tests that we do continues to grow faster than that. Together we will win together. We will solve this problem and move on. America is always great. Thank you again."
2020-04-27,22:28,Donald Trump,Thank you very much. Thank you.
2020-04-27,22:35,Doug McMillan,"Thank you Mr president. My name is Doug McMillan. I’m a Walmart associate and I too would like to start by thanking our associates for everything that they’re doing in our store, Sam’s clubs, distribution centers, and in our eCommerce fulfillment centers. They’ve been inspiring and continue to have a can do attitude and step up. It’s much appreciated. We started 45 days ago as that everyone else and we’ve been operating sites for a while now. We’re now up to 20 sites across 11 States. By the end of next week we’ll be to 45 and by the end of may, we’ll be at 100 and we also, a few weeks ago, vice president Pence and I were in a distribution center in Virginia food distribution center. He was kind enough to come and thank our associates for us there, which is much appreciated."
2020-04-27,23:15,Doug McMillan,"And the president and vice president were speaking on the phone about surgical gowns and the president asked if we could put in an order for millions of surgical gowns and we don’t normally buy those. So I wasn’t sure if we were going to be able to do that. But I’d like to thank our apparel team and McKesson in particular for partnering with us. We’ve been able to in the month of April, secure an additional two and a half million surgical gowns and by the end of May we’ll have an additional 6,000,000 available to help. So thank you for the opportunity to serve and for being here."
2020-04-27,23:44,Donald Trump,Thank you. Great job. Thank you.
2020-04-27,23:52,Heyward Donigan,"Thank you Mr president and thanks to the team for getting this great operation up and running for the benefit of the country. I’m Heyward Donagen with Rite Aid and we are currently operating 40% of the current test sites in 25 locations across eight States. I had the opportunity as I was driving up to stop at our Richmond location and see the testing in action and thank the associates, whether it be security or pharmacy, front end, everybody who’s helping with this great effort and all of the customers that appreciate this so much. It was really amazing to see and I want to thank my 50,000 associates also for keeping these retail locations up and running during these really, really tough times. It’s been quite amazing and we too are going to expand our testing and we’re doing about 1500 a day. Thanks"
2020-04-27,24:54,Donald Trump,"Thank you very much. So thank you all very much. It’s incredible what we’ve done together over a short period of time. I want to thank our vice president for the task force and the work. Every day it gets better, and we had a fantastic call with the governors today and I would say that they are as thrilled as they can be, considering that the fact is that there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems decided not to do it that way and the whole world is suffering because of it. 184 countries at least, but I want to thank all of these great businessmen and women for the job they’ve done. They’ve been fantastic with us working with us and as you know, for several weeks my administration has encouraged the governors to leverage unused testing capacity in States."
2020-04-27,25:51,Donald Trump,"Very few understood that we have tremendous capacity. Then one week ago we provided each governor with a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they could find additional testing capacity in their state. Within 48 hours, the number of tests performed across the country began to absolutely skyrocket. On Saturday alone, more than 200,000 test results were reported, which is a gigantic number, bigger than any country, anywhere in the world for a much longer period of time. A number that is an increase earlier in the month when we tested roughly less than 100,000 a day so we much more than doubled it and that will be doubling again very shortly. We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening and the reopening process we want to get our country open and the testing is not going to be a problem at all."
2020-04-27,26:48,Donald Trump,"In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have. Today were releasing additional guidance on testing to inform the States as they develop their plans for a phased and very safe reopening. Our blueprint describes how States should unlock their full capacity, expand the number of testing platforms, establish monitoring systems to detect local outbreaks and conduct contact tracing. We have it all other countries that calling to find out what are we doing and how do you do it and we’re helping them with dealing with a lot of countries, helping them on testing just like we did on the ventilators. I directed our Medicare program to make it easier for seniors to get the testing that they need and the pharmacies… as you know, we are allowing pharmacies now to do testing and we have other testing locations that we’re going to be allowing also."
2020-04-27,27:43,Donald Trump,"But having pharmacies get involved in testing is a very big deal. We’re also asking governors to do the same in their Medicaid program, so they are going to be able and authorized to do the same in Medicaid. So it’s a big, that’s a big deal. So we’re deploying the full power and strength of the federal government to help States, cities to help local government get this horrible plague over with and over with fast. There is tremendous energy in our country right now. There’s energy like people haven’t seen in a long time, a spirit that they have not seen."
2020-04-27,28:19,Donald Trump,"And we’re doing very well, very well considering what happened to us and considering if you look at what happened to others, this is something that the world has not seen for a long, long time. You can probably go back to 1917 where it was a terrible period of time. You all know what happened in 1917 that’s over 100 years ago. With that, I’d like to introduce if I might, Dr Birx, if you could come up and then Edmond you’ll come up and between the two of you, you’ll explain the entire process and how much progress we’ve made and where we’re going. Thank you very much."
2020-04-27,28:59,Dr. Deborah Birx,"Thank you mr president. So the blueprint lays out the roles and responsibilities to enhance our partnership between the private sector and the public sector, bringing together State and local governments with the federal government to ensure that we can accomplish and achieve our core principles and objectives. We can have the first slide. The core elements of the testing plan include both three elements, robust diagnostic testing plans developed in partnerships with State. And I just really want to thank the governors and the health officials both at the State and local levels who’ve been working with us day and night to work through these issues and also all the laboratory directors in many of the States as well as the American society for microbiology who’ve been working with us to ensure that the plans were efficient and effective. Within the robust diagnostic testing plans, it was really unlocking the full capacity of the State, increasing the number of testing platforms."
2020-04-27,29:57,Dr. Deborah Birx,"We now have multiple tests for different platforms, increasing the ability to collect samples, increasing testing and laboratory supplies, and ensuring that we work together to make sure that every client receives the test that they need. This is added with timely monitoring systems, and what do I mean by that? Systems where we bring together the ability to not only diagnose the symptomatic, but proactively and interactively work with individuals that we know are at higher risk. We’ve worked with States to look at where the outbreaks have occurred when they’re not in the large metros. And we see that it occurs very often in places of close settings among our native Americans and among our longterm care facilities."
2020-04-27,30:40,Dr. Deborah Birx,"So an active monitoring program that’s active, integrated and innovative. And then combining us with a third element, which is the rapid response program relying on CDC to be working with State and local governments to ensure that every symptomatic case and critically the asymptomatic cases are quickly tracked and traced to ensure that we can not only control this epidemic but predict outbreaks before they expand. And then finally, the plan includes approach of using science and technology to develop even newer platforms, more efficient testing, really ensuring that the antibody tests that are utilized and recommended by both FDA and CDC have high quality in predicting both exposure to the virus and antibody development. And then finally working on innovative tests that could be high throughput and point of care, and antigen based test or a point of care expanded nucleic acid test. Thank you."
2020-04-27,31:37,Donald Trump,Very good. Thank you. Admiral please.
2020-04-27,31:46,Brett Giroir,"Thank you Mr president. And thank you ambassador Birx. If I could have the next slide please. I want to spend just a couple of minutes about going over where we’ve been, but more importantly, where we’re going. I think we all can understand how we can group this into three distinct…"
2020-04-27,32:03,Brett Giroir,"I think we all can understand how we can group this into three distinct phases. First is our launch phase. When we were really engaging the emerging epidemic and the types of things we need to do. For example, mobilize the private sector to develop tests and have EUAs. And I think you know, over the past two months the FDA has issued 67 Emergency Use Authorizations, which is far outpacing anything that has been done or could ever been imagined. Galvanizing the research community and the commercial labs. The reason why we’re here with ACLA Labs having done about three million tests is because of that day when it was galvanized by the President and the Vice President."
2020-04-27,32:40,Brett Giroir,"We also set models in the community. Those first community-based testing sites that were federally supported, and really under the direction of the US Public Health Service, people who had been in Japan testing people on the Diamond Princess to assure that it would be done right and it would be done safely for everyone involved."
2020-04-27,32:58,Brett Giroir,"Then we moved to really scaling. That phase was very, very important because we knew we needed to be at an immense scale to enter the third phase about supporting opening again. This again, for example, a lot of my life is about swabs. It was enhancing the production capability of a small company in Maine called Puritan, that you’ll hear a whole lot more about, that is sort of the swap provider for the country. But also because of the FDA actions and the actions of scientific community being able to broaden the types to spun polyester. So US Cotton can now come in and start delivering within the next couple of weeks 3 million swabs per week of a different type. It also did things like expanding the community based testing sites. Whereas we started small with the commercial partners, you see today, right now, we have 73 of this 2.0 sites going to 110."
2020-04-27,33:52,Brett Giroir,"And very importantly, this demonstrated the model and 68% of those sites are in communities of moderate or high social vulnerability. And 22% are in the highest social vulnerability communities so that we can make sure the testing gets where it needs to be. You’ve just heard that that could be expanded to thousands of sites."
2020-04-27,34:12,Brett Giroir,"And finally, Stage Three, which is very exciting. Coordinating with governors to support testing plans and rapid response programs. Over the past week, a multidisciplinary team from the White House, HHS, FDA, FEMA has met virtually with multidisciplinary teams from every State, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia to understand what their testing aspirations are, and to make sure that we can meet those demands. We’re going to have another round of those calls this week. But as we talked about earlier today, we will be able to supply every state with the supplies and the tests that they need, that will dramatically increase the number of tests we’ve done to this point."
2020-04-27,34:57,Brett Giroir,"Just to give you an idea, the supplies that we will be providing to States, the minimum that we’re supplying to States, is approximately double in that month then the Republic of Korea has performed in the four months to now accumulated. To give you an idea of the amount of testing that we’re going to be doing."
2020-04-27,35:16,Brett Giroir,"So, I’m very exciting right now as we complete this ecosystem with the large reference labs, the LabCorp and Quest, providing the very high throughput, large scale testing. The galvanizing of the hospitals and academic labs that Dr. Birx has done by a machine to machine understanding and promoting that with the governors. And, of course, using point-of-care testing when and where that’s very important to stop outbreaks, or in remote areas like in the Indian Health Service or in Alaska. Thank you, Mr. President."
2020-04-27,35:49,Donald Trump,"Great job. Okay, so with that we’re here to answer some questions and Mike is up here also, so we’ll answer. Steve, please go ahead."
2020-04-27,35:59,Steve Holland,"As governors grapple with when and how to open their states, what’s the best advice from you on what they should do? How quickly, how slow should they-"
2020-04-27,36:06,Donald Trump,"We want them to do it. We recommend that they do it as quickly as possible, but safely. We want everyone to be safe. And I think you’re seeing that, you’re seeing a lot of governors get out and they want to open it up. Many are thinking about their school system, not a long way to go in the school system right now for this season, for this year. But, I think you’ll see a lot of schools open up, even if it’s for a very short period of time. I think it would be a good thing. Because as you see, in terms of what this vicious virus goes after, young people seem to do very well. Young people seem to do very well. So I know that there are some governors that aren’t necessarily ready to open up their states, but they may be ready to open up their school systems. We’ll see. But that’s their choice. But the word is safety. Okay? Rapid. But safety. Yeah. Please. Go ahead, please."
2020-04-27,36:57,Jon Decker,"Thank you, Mr. President. I had a question for you regarding one of the members of your Coronavirus Taskforce. And that’s Secretary of HHS, Alex Azar. On January the 28th he was in the briefing room, and in the briefing room he told reporters that for the individual American the virus should not be an impact on their day to day life. Three months later, more than 55,000 of our fellow Americans have now lost their lives. Mr. President, why is he still your top health advisor? Why is he still serving as the HHS Secretary?"
2020-04-27,37:32,Donald Trump,"Well, I think it’s a very unfair question. Because you have many great professionals, some of them you have great respect for. And you have many people on the other party, you mentioned Alex Azar, but you have many people in the other party that have said the same thing and with even more confidence. So a lot of people didn’t get that right. I was very fortunate, whether it was through luck or whatever, that we closed the border. We put a ban on China other than our citizens coming in. We had our citizens, you can’t keep out American citizens. You know, “Gee, you can’t come back into your country,” that’s a little tough to do. But we put a ban on China, that was very fortunate. But I could tell you that Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets in Chinatown. She wanted to go, “Let’s go out and party.” That was late into February, so you don’t mention that, but you could mention that. Go ahead. Any other? Please, go ahead."
2020-04-27,38:22,Jon Decker,…since April third Mr. President.
2020-04-27,38:25,Donald Trump,"Go ahead. Yeah please, stand up."
2020-04-27,38:26,Jon Decker,"He has not been in a briefing, Mr. President, since April the third. Does that show confidence in him?"
2020-04-27,38:28,Donald Trump,You should have no complaints. Please.
2020-04-27,38:29,Jon Decker,"But, but-"
2020-04-27,38:30,Mario Parker,"Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you retweeted someone who alleged that Democrats have, quote, “inflated,” the mortality rate of the coronavirus by under-reporting the infection rate. Do you believe that’s true? That there’s some sort of conspiracy theory regarding the number of infections States are reporting?"
2020-04-27,38:50,Donald Trump,"Well, I can only say what we’re doing. We’re reporting very accurately. If you look at other countries, other countries are not. I mean, you can look at China, you can look at numerous countries where I don’t think those are right numbers. I can only say what we’re doing. It’s very important to us to do very accurate reporting and that’s what we’re doing. John, go ahead please."
2020-04-27,39:07,Mario Parker,"…by retweeting that, Mr. President?"
2020-04-27,39:07,Donald Trump,"Thank you, please John?"
2020-04-27,39:08,Jonathan Karl,"Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the Payment Protection Plan, the PPP plan to help small businesses. There’ve been a lot of concerns today with the website just not working. In fact, we heard from the American Bankers Association saying that they are deeply frustrated and until it’s fixed American banks will not be able to help struggling small businesses. Do you know-"
2020-04-27,39:30,Donald Trump,"Well, I just came out and I hadn’t heard. I heard there was a glitch. We’ll find out whether or not that’s so. Certainly it did work out very well for the original amount of money. This is the second amount and I’ll find out about that. We’re relying on the banks to go out and do an accurate job. Yeah, please. In the back."
2020-04-27,39:47,Charlie Spiering,Thank you.
2020-04-27,39:48,Jonathan Karl,"… of all the companies that get aid, Mr. President-"
2020-04-27,39:49,Donald Trump,"Well, I wouldn’t mind doing that. I don’t know what the legal status of something like that. I would like to do that, as far as I’m concerned. I’m not involved in that process, but I would certainly like to have it listed. I’d have to find out if there’s a legal problem, but if there isn’t I would do it gladly. Please."
2020-04-27,40:04,Charlie Spiering,"Thank you, Mr. President. Charlie Spiering, Breitbart News. A majority of polls show that Americans blame China for the spread of the coronavirus and yet they’re taking advantage of the crisis to make the world more dependent on their supply chains. How do you hold China accountable and how do you keep our country-"
2020-04-27,40:23,Donald Trump,"Well, Charlie, there are a lot of ways you can hold them accountable. We’re doing very serious investigations, as you probably know. We are not happy with China, we are not happy with that whole situation. Because we believe it could have been stopped at the source, it could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world. We think that should have happened. So, we’ll let you know at the appropriate time. But we are doing serious investigations."
2020-04-27,40:46,Charlie Spiering,… American businesses from relying on China for their supply chains. How do you fix that?
2020-04-27,40:52,Donald Trump,"Well, we’ve already discussed that and especially having to do with supplies, and others. If you look prior to this virus, the deficit was coming way down under my administration because I put massive tariffs on China. We took in tens of billions of dollars, gave some of it to the farmers who were unfairly targeted by China. Nobody’s ever done that before. We never took in ten cents from China. Now all of a sudden, I think you know very well, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars. I helped the farmers by giving them, two years ago, $12 billion all coming from China. And we had plenty of leftover, too. And then the following year, 16 billion and this year we’re also going to help our farmers. But nobody’s ever done a thing like that because they were targeted unfairly by China. So we’re doing a very strong investigation and we’ll let you know what the result of that is. We should be able to get the answers, too."
2020-04-27,41:45,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, please."
2020-04-27,41:46,Unnamed,"As you talk about potentially reopening up America again, as we see in the slides behind you, what data are you going to look at in the future to see if restrictions need to be reimposed?"
2020-04-27,41:55,Donald Trump,"Yeah, we’re looking very much, and reliant very much on the local areas, the governors. And that’s been the way it has been for me, maybe not for everybody, but for me that’s the way it’s been at the beginning and from the beginning. The governors, some of them are doing an extraordinary job, not all of them, but some of them. And I think all of them, maybe, hasn’t had a chance to do that. Some will be a little bit different. The areas are much different. Manhattan is much different than Montana. You have a lot of different circumstances. And obviously, if you look at the virus, it hits some areas, hasn’t hit very much other areas not even at all. Almost not at all. But the entire country has been infected. West Virginia, as an example, I spoke to Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia. And they were a long before anything hit, and they had numerous deaths even in West Virginia, and they were really the last one to be hit."
2020-04-27,42:49,Donald Trump,"So we’re dealing with the governors. We had a really great call today, as I told you, very, very solid. These were not complaining people. These were people that… They had everything they needed, they had their ventilators, they have their testing. They see their testing is growing, they’re growing their testing, we’re helping them. We’re getting them what they need. I’m sure some of you are on the line, even though you weren’t supposed to be, and I think you know what the result of that call was. Please, go ahead."
2020-04-27,43:20,Unnamed,"Following up on Charlie’s question on making China, holding them responsible. Germany sent a bill to China for 130 billion Euros for the damages caused by the coronavirus. Would your administration look at doing the same?"
2020-04-27,43:36,Donald Trump,"Well, we can do something much easier than that. We have ways of doing things a lot easier than that. But Germany’s looking at things and we’re looking at things. And we’re talking about a lot more money than Germany’s talking about. Yeah."
2020-04-27,43:47,Donald Trump,"Please, go ahead. We haven’t determined the final amount yet. It’s very substantial. If you look at the world, I mean, this is worldwide damage. This is damage to the US, but this is damaged to the world. Yeah, please."
2020-04-27,43:59,Yamiche Alcindor,"Thank you, Mr. President. Attorney General, William Barr directed federal prosecutors to watch out for state and local officials that might be violating the constitution by some of their stay at home or orders. What’s the strategy there? Would the Federal Government sue local authorities?"
2020-04-27,44:13,Donald Trump,"Well, you’d have to ask Attorney General Barr. But I think he wants to see, like everybody, he wants to see people get back and wants to see people get back to work. He doesn’t want people to be held up when there’s no reason for doing it. In some cases, perhaps, it’s too strict. He wants to make sure that people have their rights and they maintain their rights. Very importantly. So, a lot of people would agree with him. But you’d actually have to ask that question specifically, from a legal standpoint, to Attorney General Barr."
2020-04-27,44:38,Yamiche Alcindor,… the Federal Government suing state officials?
2020-04-27,44:39,Donald Trump,"It would depend on the state. It would depend on the circumstances of the state. But some states are perhaps a little early and some states are a little bit late. And the Attorney General… I read that and I saw that, and frankly, the Attorney General doesn’t want to have rights taken away. Because, there are some people that aren’t allowed to open up a store, they’re going to lose their livelihood. And by the way, that causes death, also. Between all of the things that happen, and this has been a big study. The fact that people aren’t allowed to have their freedom causes a tremendous amount of problems, including death. So that’s what he’s talking about."
2020-04-27,45:17,Donald Trump,"Please, in the back."
2020-04-27,45:20,Unnamed,"… now and in other states. Governor Larry Hogan specifically said they’ve seen a spike in people using disinfectant after your comments last week. I know you said they were sarcastic, but do you take-"
2020-04-27,45:31,Donald Trump,"I can’t imagine why, I can’t imagine why. Yeah."
2020-04-27,45:34,Unnamed,…take any responsibility if someone where to die?
2020-04-27,45:35,Donald Trump,"No, I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine that. Yeah, go ahead please."
2020-04-27,45:38,Unnamed,"…President. Dr. Anthony Fauci says that we need to increase testing by double it, at least. And so does the Rockefeller Foundation. When are we going to be doubling testing?"
2020-04-27,45:48,Donald Trump,"It doesn’t really matter what they say there, and we just left him. We just had a meeting. Because we’re going to have much more than double it, very soon. Now there are big believers in testing and then there are some governors that don’t feel as strongly about it at all. You understand that, they feel much differently about it. But we’re going with maximum testing because it’s something we’re very capable of doing. But we’ll be much more than doubled. You know, Mike, I’d like you to answer that. We’re going to be much higher than doubled on testing very shortly. Mike, please."
2020-04-27,46:24,Mike Pence,"Thank you, Mr. President. I hope the American people looking on today are as proud as the President and I are of the incredible public and private partnership that you heard from today. It was two months ago that we had done less than 10,000 tests for the coronavirus in the United States. But because the President brought together these incredible commercial labs, brought together the best known retailers in America, now Mr. President, we have 5.4 million tests. And as you said earlier today we’ve done more than 200,000 tests in a single day."
2020-04-27,47:06,Mike Pence,"As we met with governors today, I sensed the enthusiasm among governors for the way that testing is scaling all across the country. And, we assured them on the call today that we’re going to continue to directly partner with them to make sure that all of the resources you’ve heard about today continue to be expanded."
2020-04-27,47:26,Mike Pence,"I want to ask Admiral Giroir, who is literally working day in and day out with the governors, to describe some of the numbers for exactly where we will be. We’re North of 5 million tests done now. It is remarkable to think of the pace of acceleration. But Admiral, maybe you could speak about exactly when we will reach the point that some of the experts say that they think we need to be at. Whether that be the 300,000 tests a day or 500,000 tests a day. But what’s remarkable to me as a lay person, Mr. President, is because of this partnership you’ve forged. We’re almost there."
2020-04-27,48:03,Mike Pence,"Because of this partnership you’ve forged, we’re almost there. And we’ll be there very, very soon for the American people. But everyone who is anxious to see America reopen, as this president and our entire administration are, should know that the three-phased approach that the president outlined 10 days ago, we believe, and I believe increasingly governors understand around America, that we have a sufficient amount of testing today for every state that qualifies to enter phase one to begin to reopen their economies. And Mr. President, with your permission, I’ll just ask Admiral Gerard to give some specific numbers about for all that we’ve done, how much more quickly you’ll see an expansion of testing because of the partnership that you witnessed again here today."
2020-04-27,48:49,Brett Giroir,"Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. The number of tests that need to be done depends on the state level. You understand that places where there’s high virus circulating will need many, many more tests. Places that do not have high virus circulating may need less tests. But let’s just assume Dr. Fauci was talking about about a four million per month number, which was sort of a week ago where we are. So we will, according to the governor’s plans for next month, we will easily double that four million number. We will have over 20 million swabs that we’re going to send out. We will have over 15 million tubes of media. We have all the tests matched machine to machine in a focused area. We’ve gone state by state and understand that."
2020-04-27,49:39,Brett Giroir,"And this is not even including what you just heard, the five million per month test by LabCorp and Quest, or the point of care test by Abbott, or all the other tests that are out there. So in May, we are going to be doing more testing in this country. And people talk about South Korea a lot. The states with the least amount of testing will double the overall cumulative number per capita that South Korea has done in four months, to give you that understanding."
2020-04-27,50:11,Donald Trump,"Go ahead, John."
2020-04-27,50:12,John (Reporter),"Good morning. This sounds incredibly promising. Walgreens, CVS for the drive through test, the diagnostic agencies. But we sat here in the Rose Garden back on March 13 and these companies were here, some other companies were here. By my count, only 69 drive through test sites have been set up by the companies that were here. I’m wondering if… And of course Mr. Vice President back in early March, you said we’d be at four million tests by the following week. We’re just now got there in the last few days. So what have you learned about what went wrong a month and a half or over the last month and a half or two months? And what’s going to go right now? What lessons have you learned from the mistakes over the last month and a half or so?"
2020-04-27,50:53,Mike Pence,"John, I appreciate the question, but it represents a misunderstanding on your part and frankly a lot of people in the public’s part about the difference between having a test versus the ability to actually process the test. The truth was when the president tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force two months ago, we saw the production of lots of test kits going into the marketplace. But as the president has said many times, what he understood early on was the old system would never be able to process the tests at the massive volume that we would need in the midst of an epidemic. And that’s why the president brought together these extraordinary commercial labs that you’ve heard from today. Literally sat them down in the Roosevelt Room and said, “We need you to turn all of your energies loose on doing the kind of high speed testing that would be necessary for us to reach the numbers we’re at today.”"
2020-04-27,51:52,Mike Pence,"And so there was no disconnect at all. There were lots of test kits out there, and well frankly there still are today. There are literally millions of tests that could be run in the old style slow laboratory that are still conducting tests today, whether it be at the CDC or at state laboratories. But what the president brought about with this public private partnership has brought us to the point where we’ve done 5.4 million tests to date. And literally, you just heard that by next month, we could be doing as many as two million tests a week all across the country to give the American people confidence that we can reopen and get our economy moving again."
2020-04-27,52:34,John (Reporter),"So when you said four million tests seven weeks ago, you were just talking about tests being sent out, not actually being completed? I’m a little confused."
2020-04-27,52:43,Mike Pence,"John, I think, precisely correct, that in my first week on this job, we were informed that HHS, I believe IDT was the vendor, Admiral Gerard, that had distributed a million, was distributing another four million. And we believe they did. But again, those were tests that frankly, but for the president’s leadership, we’d still be waiting on those tests to be done in many cases, because they were tests that were designed to be run in the old laboratory model. But early on at the president’s direction, we brought in these incredible commercial labs. We partnered with these extraordinary retailers and now we stand here today. Literally one day last week, more than 200,000 tests in a single day. About the time that we were making those comments, we’d done less than 25,000 tests in the entire country. But we’ve met this moment with American ingenuity, with the incredible companies that are represented here, and we couldn’t be more proud."
2020-04-27,53:40,John (Reporter),"Follow up, Mr. Vice President. A follow up."
2020-04-27,53:42,Donald Trump,"I think it’s very important to know, and this you can get from any other country I think if they’re being honest, not only do we have the most testing in the world by far, but we have by far the best testing. OAN please. Go ahead."
2020-04-27,53:56,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you. As I’d like to switch gears and talk about general Flynn. There are reports circulating now that he may well be fully exonerated this week. If that were the case, is there any reason why you would not bring him back into the administration?"
2020-04-27,54:15,Donald Trump,"I will only say this. I think that general Flynn is a wonderful man, he had a wonderful career, and it was a disgrace what happened to general Flynn. Let’s see what happens now. But what happened to general Flynn should never happen again in our country. What happened to other people should never happen again in our country. What happened to your president of the United States should never again be allowed to happen. Go ahead please."
2020-04-27,54:49,Unnamed,"Mr. President, thank you. Today, one of your top economic advisors, Kevin Hassett, he said that the US is likely to experience a 20 to 30% decline in the GDP in the second quarter, the worst since the great depression. Do you agree with that assessment?"
2020-04-27,55:05,Donald Trump,"I don’t know, but I can tell you the third and the fourth quarter in particular are going to be, I think, spectacular. We were talking about it with the executives. I think we’re going to have a phenomenal third quarter. Nobody except one country can be held accountable for what happened. Nobody’s blaming anybody here. We’re looking at a group of people that should have stopped it at the source. But so what happens in second happens in second. What we are doing is I think we’re going to have, you’re going to see a big rise in the third, but you’re going to see an incredible fourth quarter and you’re going to have an incredible next year. I think you’re going to have a recovery. Look. I built, they were just telling me inside and it’s fact, I built the greatest economy. With the help of 325 million people, I built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And one day because of something that should have never been allowed to happen, we had to close our country, we had to close our economy. I built it. We had the best employment numbers and the best unemployment numbers for Hispanic American, for African American, for Asian American, for everybody, best stock market numbers. And by the way, the stock market was up very substantially today and people are seeing a lot of good things. A lot of very smart people investing in the stock market right now. It’s at 24,000, approximately 24,000. And if you would have said with the tragedy that this country had to endure and go through, with all of the death and the people that died and were so badly hurt by what happened. And you can only say God bless them. But if you would have said that our country would be in the position we’re now. We’re ready to move forward."
2020-04-27,56:56,Donald Trump,"We’ll never forget loved ones. We’ll never forget these great people that sacrifice for a reason of incompetence or something else other than incompetence, what happened at a point where they could have protected the whole world. Not just us, the whole world. But we had the greatest economy ever in the history of our world. And I had to turn it off in order to get to a point where we are today. And now we’re making a comeback. And I think we’re going to have economically, from an economic standpoint, next year an unbelievable year. And I think that you’re going to see a fantastic fourth quarter and the third quarter, we’ll start to build. But the second quarter, obviously you’re going to have GDP lack of growth. I’m looking at the head of Walmart. What a job Walmart’s done in going through something. They were doing yeoman’s work, including getting us millions of really very, very protective outfits. And the job that Doug and Walmart did was incredible."
2020-04-27,58:02,Donald Trump,"Millions of outfits. And those are high quality. I’ve seen them. Those are high quality. That’s what we need. So people have stepped up to the plate. I think we’re going to have a really good. I think it’s going to start building. I think it’s going to build fast. I think it will be a tremendous, tremendous comeback. And so I say, I built the greatest economy. With all of the people that helped me and all of the people in this country, we built the greatest economy the world has ever seen. And we’re going to do it again. And it’s not going to be that long. Okay. Yes, please go ahead."
2020-04-27,58:32,Unnamed,"Mr. President, opening up the country, how long will you keep up the travel restrictions for Europe?"
2020-04-27,58:38,Donald Trump,"Well, we’re looking at that and it depends on how long it’s taking Europe to heal. Italy is starting to make a comeback. I’m very happy to see that with my friend, the prime minister. It’s tragic what went on in Italy, and Spain, and France, and Germany frankly, and every country over there. It’s tragic. But we’ll be looking at what’s happening in Europe and certainly we want to do that and they want to do it too. They want to do it very badly. Yeah."
2020-04-27,59:03,Unnamed,Do you have any update on Kim Jong-un’s health?
2020-04-27,59:07,Donald Trump,Say it.
2020-04-27,59:07,Unnamed,Have you gotten any update on Kim Jong-un’s health? Has he responded to your letter from March?
2020-04-27,59:12,Donald Trump,"On Kim Jong-un? I can’t tell you exactly. Yes. I do have a very good idea but I can’t talk about it now. I just wish him well. I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un. If I weren’t president, you’d be in war. You would have been in war with Korea. You would have been in war with North Korea if I wasn’t president. That I can tell you. He expected that. That I can tell you. I hope he’s fine. I do know how he’s doing relatively speaking. We will see. You’ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future. All right, one or two more. Go ahead. Please."
2020-04-27,59:49,Unnamed,Are you confirming he’s alive?
2020-04-27,59:50,Unnamed,"Yeah, I had a question about the 2020 election. Your likely Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, recently suggested that you were considering changing the date of the election, that you might try something like that. That’s my first question. The second question is-"
2020-04-27,01:00:05,Donald Trump,"I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd, it’s a good number. No, I look forward to that election and that was just made up propaganda, not by him but by some of the many people that are working, writing little statements. I see all the time statement made, you say so statement made per Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe. He didn’t make those statements but somebody did. But they said he made it. No, let him know I’m not thinking about it at all. Not at all. Go ahead, in the back please. Please."
2020-04-27,01:00:37,Unnamed,The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee came out with the fourth installment of this report. It concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections and there was not political bias. Do you accept its conclusions?
2020-04-27,01:00:47,Donald Trump,"Oh, I don’t know. I haven’t seen the report. I haven’t seen the report. Yeah, please go ahead."
2020-04-27,01:00:51,Unnamed,"President, nice to see you. I think you have a good relationship with North Korea and with Kim Jong-un, but last Saturday, Senator Graham, he mentioned in the Fox News, he interviewed. He said that-"
2020-04-27,01:01:10,Donald Trump,He didn’t say anything last Saturday.
2020-04-27,01:01:12,Unnamed,… that Kim Jong-un-
2020-04-27,01:01:14,Donald Trump,"Nobody knows where he is, so he obviously couldn’t have said it. If you have a… This is breaking news that Kim Jung-un made a statement on Saturday. I don’t think so."
2020-04-27,01:01:22,Unnamed,But anyways-
2020-04-27,01:01:22,Donald Trump,"Okay, go ahead."

2020-04-27,01:01:24,Donald Trump,"Let’s do one more. Please, in the back."
2020-04-27,01:01:26,Unnamed,"If an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be reelected?"
2020-04-27,01:01:36,Donald Trump,"So yeah, we’ve lost a lot of people, but if you look at what original projections were, 2.2 million, we’re probably heading to 60 thousand, 70 thousand. It’s far too many. One person is too many for this. And I think we’ve made a lot of really good decisions. The big decision was closing the border or doing the ban, people coming in from China. Obviously other than American citizens which had to come in. Can’t say you can’t come back to your country. I think we’ve made a lot of good decisions. I think that Mike Pence and the task force have done a fantastic job. I think that everybody working on the ventilators, you see what we’ve done there, have done unbelievable."
2020-04-27,01:02:17,Donald Trump,"The press doesn’t talk about ventilators anymore. They just don’t want to talk about them and that’s okay. But the reason they don’t want to talk… That was a subject that nobody would get off of. They don’t want to talk about them. We’re in the same position on testing. We are lapping the world on testing and the world is coming to us. As I said, they’re coming to us saying, “What are you doing? How do you do it?” We’re helping them. So, no, I think we’ve done a great job and one person, I will say this, one person is too many. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you."
