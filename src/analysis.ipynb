The nature of trials as the experts have explained to us is that the vaccine might yet not be available till late this year or early next. But the therapeutics, giving relief to people that contract the coronavirus could literally be available by this summer or early fall. The most encouraging news from that meeting was that our pharmaceutical companies, which are recognized as the greatest in the world, all have already formed a consortium to work together to share information in the development of therapeutics and vaccines.

Neither the President nor I had direct contact with that staff person. We worked immediately with the White House physician and the CDC. We\\u2019ve done all contact tracing and while the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as Vice-President and as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, both I and my wife will be tested for the Corona virus later this afternoon.\", \"polarity\": 0.07380536130536132, \"subjectivity\": 0.33144910644910647}, {\"date\": \"2020-03-21\", \"timestamp\": \"22:52\", \"speaker\": \"Mike Pence\", \"text\": \"Dr. Anthony Fauci\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"date\": \"2020-03-21\", \"timestamp\": \"23:03\", \"speaker\": \"Mike Pence\", \"text\": \"Dr. Anthony Fauci\", \"polarity\": -0.1074074074074074, \"subjectivity\": 0.44814814814814813}, {\"date\": \"2020-03-21\", \"timestamp\": \"23:52\", \"speaker\": \"Mike Pence\", \"text\": \"I did hear one story this morning, Mr. President, about a senior named, Geneva Wood.

For everyone who\\u2019s kept someone, you can immediately get that money. You can deduct it from what you owe the IRS immediately. If you don\\u2019t know us money, you\\u2019ll get a refundable tax credit. So that is up and running. I\\u2019m also pleased to report we have the program up and running.

Thank you. So I hope you got from the conference today that we\\u2019re triangulating data that we know from the case numbers, the testing numbers, the supply chain numbers to create an integrated picture so that we can really support hospitals in their needs. And I think that level of granularity is really critical. Secondly, I just want to make the point that we really applaud the governors that are looking at a whole of state or a whole of metro approach. And what do I mean by that? The United States going into this had about 160,000 ventilators across the United States and another 60,000 to 70,000 anesthesia machines. That\\u2019s about five times what most of the European countries have, but it\\u2019s a matter of distribution to need and I really applaud the governors that are bringing together their public hospitals with their more private hospitals and their visibility across their state.\", \"polarity\": 0.12980769230769232, \"subjectivity\": 0.33301282051282055}, {\"date\": \"2020-04-02\", \"timestamp\": \"01:26:52\", \"speaker\": \"Dr. Deborah Birx\", \"text\": \"Because what we tried to talk about yesterday is every state, every county is different. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re looking at it at that level of granularity. And as we move through this epidemic, the needs need to be very tailored to those counties and frankly, those hospitals. There is a reason why the president and Mr. Kushner have been very much involved in finding out what the public hospitals need. Why is that? Because the public hospitals sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they\\u2019re often sometimes not as attractive to private sector distributors or they may be too busy caring for the needs of patients to be really on top of their order forms and their supply chains. So really listening to the community that\\u2019s at the front of the of this fight and getting feedback from those specific communities no matter where they are and listening to the frontline healthcare workers because it\\u2019s their reality that is important to all of us, whether you\\u2019re the mayor or the governor or the federal government.\", \"polarity\": 0.205, \"subjectivity\": 0.39944444444444444}, {\"date\": \"2020-04-02\", \"timestamp\": \"01:27:55\", \"speaker\": \"Dr. Deborah Birx\", \"text\": \"And if they are saying they need something, we have to work together to supply that.

Every county will move through this differently and that allows us to move around these vital issues that protect the frontline healthcare workers and protect the patients through the ventilators to make sure that the supply chain is aligned with the need as it happens. Now you have to have very good data in order to be willing to work in that level of granularity. And that\\u2019s what we\\u2019ve been working on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that. So I just wanted to say one other thing about testing. Just to give you the bottom line data of what we\\u2019re seeing. We appreciate the groups who are reporting. Not everyone is reporting yet. And this is part of us trying to understand at a very granular level, we do have two States that do have 35% positives and that\\u2019s New York and New Jersey.\", \"polarity\": 0.2307727272727272, \"subjectivity\": 0.5202979797979798}, {\"date\": \"2020-04-02\", \"timestamp\": \"01:28:54\", \"speaker\": \"Dr. Deborah Birx\", \"text\": \"So that confirms very clearly that that\\u2019s a very clear and important hot spot. Louisiana though has 26% of their tests are positive. Michigan, Connecticut, Indiana, Georgia, Illinois\\u2026 So that should tell you where the next hotspots are coming, are at 15% test positive. And then Colorado, DC, Rhode Island and Massachusetts are at 13%. There\\u2019s a significant number of States still under 10% everyone that I didn\\u2019t discuss. California and Washington remains steady at an 8% rate. So what we\\u2019re seeing finally is testing improving, more testing being done, still a high level of negatives in States without hotspots, allowing them to do more of this surveillance and containment. And then prioritizing this new rapid test kit to those areas that may not have the same amount of access to the Indian health services and to the public health institutions and the public health and state labs so that they can use that and start forward leaning into surveillance. Now we know there are people waiting for tests and they\\u2019re waiting for tests because when these areas got onto the logarithmic curve, we prioritized people where the test decision would make it critical for their care. And so we prioritized hospitals and we prioritize nurses and doctors and frontline workers. So that means if you went through a drive through or you went through your doctor, you could have that delay. So the masks? So what I tried to give you is how we\\u2019re using data in a very granular way. And so there is experiential data when you look at communities that have oftentimes utilized masks in general for personal protection from when they particularly are themselves sick and have used their masks in public. And we\\u2019ve looked at the rate of this Covid-19 in those populations. And then we\\u2019re looking at the scientific evidence to bring those two pieces together. Let me just say one thing though. The most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands. And we don\\u2019t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they\\u2019re behind a mask. Because if they\\u2019re touching things, remember your eyes are not in the mask. So if you\\u2019re touching things and then touching your eyes, you\\u2019re exposing yourself in the same way. So we don\\u2019t want people to feel like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m wearing a mask, I\\u2019m protected and I\\u2019m protecting others.\\u201d You may be protecting others but don\\u2019t get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected because there are other ways that you can get infected because of the number of asymptomatic and mild cases that are out there.\", \"polarity\": 0.11518398268398267, \"subjectivity\": 0.5024795574795575}, {\"date\": \"2020-04-02\", \"timestamp\": \"01:31:50\", \"speaker\": \"Dr. Deborah Birx\", \"text\": \"And so this worries us and that\\u2019s why the debate is continuing about the mask because we don\\u2019t want\\u2026 When we\\u2019re trying to send a signal that every single person in this country needs to stay six feet away from everybody. That needs to be washing their hands constantly and know where their hands are to send a signal that we think a mask is equivalent to those pieces.

Each and every day, as we see the beginnings of encouraging news, the low and steady numbers in California and Washington State and now beginning to see numbers of hospitalizations are going down and new cases leveling and in some cases going down.\", \"polarity\": 0.13856209150326798, \"subjectivity\": 0.46121509209744493}, {\"date\": \"2020-04-08\", \"timestamp\": \"01:09:02\", \"speaker\": \"Mike Pence\", \"text\": \"Dr. Deborah Birx\", \"polarity\": 0.28214285714285714, \"subjectivity\": 0.6726190476190477}, {\"date\": \"2020-04-08\", \"timestamp\": \"01:10:32\", \"speaker\": \"Dr. Deborah Birx\", \"text\": \"Thank you Mr vice president.

To the healthcare workers that are the front lines trying to save every single one, to honor them and to honor our elders and the individuals that we know are at the greatest risk for bad outcomes. We all need to continue to do our work. Yes, the number of cases is stabilizing, but I do want to go through those numbers with you because we talk about these as micro epidemics in metro areas and in rural areas.

Boston, 18% positivity, 1100 cases per day. Denver has fallen to 180 cases per day, but still has 0% positivity in they\\u2019re testing. California and Washington have stayed stable at about Seattle, 350 cases per day. On the LA metro area, 800 cases per day, but their test positive rates are remaining in the 9% range. And so, this really gives us some idea of what it takes. They have been continuously mitigating. Imagine what we\\u2019re talking about, new York going from 40+ percent, zero positivity and 11,000 cases a day, down to the LA metro area of 800 cases per day and 9%.
